			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We were betrayed!", Fenlier wiped the blood on his face, then looked down. Something like a soft, white, sticky thing makes him feel a strange touch. If nothing else, it should be a kind of delicious devil. It is said that a demon named Hannibal is very fond of eating human brains. This story has once become a means for many parents to threaten their children to sleep or eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will say that if you don’t sleep/eat again, Hannibal will dig up your brain and eat it, then scare the children or close them. With tears in his eyes, he forced himself to calm down, curled up in the bed and shivered until he fell asleep in fear. Or the scared children cried, crying, and put the food in the bowl into their mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Finnel doesn’t like this thing, this thing will not only make him like it, but also make him feel sick, that is the guy who just stood next to him The brain was spattered on his face when it was blown by a gun. The palm of his hand was covered with blood, and the dazzling Mai Renhuang made him feel an unprecedented fear and anger for the first time. He never thought that he would fall here. He still had a very wonderful future waiting for him to go to normal. How could he fall into eternal sleep here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person standing next to him seems to be looking at other places, not looking at him, after all, the face and blood and the brain like a devil like a horrible face Not very good looking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy is too bad, he was smashed by heavy weapons, something that can be called a cannon, mainly used to destroy light in war The armored equipment and armored vehicles can fire a special warhead of 18 mm, and the high-pressure kinetic energy bin that violently reacts to generate high pressure can generate up to 42,000 joules of kinetic energy at a moment, enough to hit at a distance of 100 meters. Wearing armor after two inches, piercing about one centimeter of armor at a distance of one kilometer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being hit by this bullet does not hurt at all - because the signal of pain has not been resolved by the brain as if it were from the 99th floor The melons that come down are all over the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the people around, Fenrill rubbed his face again, slamming his hand and slamming a pile of debris, a guy really Can't stand turning and vomiting. The muscles on Fenir's face were constantly twitching uncontrollably. He looked at everyone and snorted in a low voice. "We were betrayed, it must be Amon, the bastard, I will not let him go, but we The trouble must be solved first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we can't do anything, we are likely to die here today, so you give me the spirit and tell you that you must fight back. With the advantage of this favorable terrain, let those people know that we are not So easy to be eliminated, then we are qualified to sit down and talk to them, understand?", he waved his arm and expressed deep indignation, if he was allowed to catch the few people responsible for the wind, he They will be cut into a thousand pieces, and then thrown into the place where there is water to feed the fish. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Just an hour ago, the Imperial Army suddenly appeared on both sides of the valley surrounded them up, they even reaction did not react was hit Mongolia, There are crowds of people fleeing everywhere, and they seem to forget that they actually have the ability to fight hard. These guys who don't have much culture are not really clear. When everyone wants to escape, they die faster because no one stays behind to drag the enemy. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Fenrir clear, he found the main person in charge of what men make them stable emotions, we can fight for the Imperial Army also create some problems, so that they can It would be better to die some soldiers. Once the commander of the other party can't stand the pressure, it will take a relatively peaceful way to end the battle, knowing that it is a damn peacetime. In the peacetime era, an illegal armed force can kill many soldiers. The non-commissioned officers of the battle to the commander, as long as they are still alive, will inevitably be held accountable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at the beginning of the battle, Finlay found two retreats for himself. The first retreat is to let these idiots stand in front. He wants to run out. If he is still alive, he must have a way to avenge these people and avenge himself. The second retreat was after the exchange of fire between the two empire, let these imperial army feel their tenacious will to fight, and then he stood up to ask for dialogue, and then surrendered to save his life. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; as an advocate of surrender, he certainly will not die, and maybe even do not have to sit in prison, because he is not a leader, he solved the casualties that may occur The problem, he has merit for the Imperial Army, they need to guarantee his interests. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; just some things Fenrir think too of course, and in his country he saw the war may have been behind the Empire twenty years to thirty The degree of the year. This is not a joke. For some countries that lack supplies, have no energy and financial resources to develop technology, their industrial level has even stayed in the empire fifty years ago. In some of the most backward places, even cold weapons have not withdrawn from the war stage. And how terrible the level of armaments of the empire is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the collapse in the valley became a certain degree of resistance, the face of the colonel who was in charge of the battle suddenly had some shame. The people standing next to the security committee and the special commissioner of the cabinet should have It was a hearty massacre, and the result suddenly became a rogue fight. This is definitely not what he hoped. There are very few opportunities to gain military exploits in a peaceful era, and the special occupation of military personnel who wants to get the most out of promotion is the military exploit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was able to command such a battle this time, and he was robbed from several opponents with the same rank, which will also become the threshold for him to pass the threshold. The important medal of the Imperial General. But now he feels that this medal may be far away from him. He can imagine that once the newspaper begins to report that the Imperial Army is dealing with a group of old women and slaves and slaves, it will cause a lot of casualties. Soon the military will send an investigation. The group came to investigate his command in this battle. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the reason for soldiers armed with teeth to face a group of slaves who have just been released, causing serious casualties, is the enemy’s firepower too strong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the enemy too embarrassed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be that the commander is stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case, and then I don’t expect to be able to embellish a star on my shoulder in my life. After this life is dead, it will become a joke and become a certain This textbook is used as a typical example of the reverse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coldly raised the telegraph machine in front of him, "reporting all parts of the casualties.", as the voice in the telegraph continued to spread, his face It is getting darker. From the first shot of the battle to the present, forty-seven soldiers have been killed in a wave of counterattacks that have just appeared. This group of fighters, like him, can’t wait for the warriors to ride like a shotgun. The hunter of the horse, crazy chasing a group of Gobi wolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Gobi wolves found that the sticks they could make in their hands would never make a horrible sound, it was when the hunters were unlucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty-seven soldiers died in deep enemy areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more dead, the colonel told himself that he licked his mouth and issued a second order from the beginning of the battle to the present, "Retreating the entire line, closing the canyon Export, launch No. 2 incendiary bomb."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second incendiary bomb is an outstanding work of the Bondika Military Group, which is painted in deep purple The outer casing, and a yellow triangle with a beak on the outer casing, is a highly lethal incendiary bomb. The No. 2 incendiary bomb deflagrates about ten seconds after launch, and the highly thick, ignited chemical will fly in all directions during the explosion and produce high temperatures and flames. In the process of burning, this chemical also releases a highly toxic gas. Once inhaled, it will cause respiratory failure and brain damage. It only needs to stay in the gas for twenty seconds, a body. A healthy person will suffer from functional damage and eventually die of respiratory failure or brain death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large number of such incendiary bombs are exported abroad, which is said to have caused strong opposition from some warring countries. Some countries have already asked the Empire to ban the export of No. 2 incendiary bombs. The request, but so far the cabinet has not yet approved, thinking that the Federation is also exporting similar incendiary bombs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the instructions of the colonel were transmitted to the various team detachments through the telegraph machine, the heads of these soldiers quickly calmed down and they began to cover each other in an orderly retreat. Especially when they heard that they were going to fire the No. 2 incendiary bomb, I was afraid that I would fall into it. It was definitely not a fun thing. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the soldiers were determined to have withdrawn from the valley, they blocked the exits on both sides of the valley, and there were special machines that were more than a hundred meters wide. The mouth of the valley began to spray water mist. The toxic smoke produced by the burning of the chemical of the No. 2 incendiary bomb can fully fuse with the water molecules in the air after it encounters the water mist, and then falls on the ground. This is also one of the most effective and simple ways to deal with the No. 2 incendiary bomb. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way is to cover the nose and mouth with water and damp cloth, which can effectively block the entry of toxic gases into the body, of course, if it is in the poisonous smoke The time is too long, you may need to prepare more wet cloth, because swallowing water with toxic chemicals can also damage human organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenrill in the valley watched the army begin to retreat, he breathed a sigh of relief, he did it, let the soldiers feel the pain, then the bargain Link. As long as he can leave here alive, he swears that he will retaliate against Amon and let him know the anger from the ice sea man! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
