			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several police cars flying fast from the street and stopped at the incident. The bureau chief saw the body of a place from the car and knew that it was a gang vendetta. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of gangs, smugglers, killers and many "businessmen" who travel in the gray area. If there is no week It will be strange to have a gang fight or assassination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that when the secretary who was still a little relaxed on the way went to the sidewalk and saw Abel, whose neck and chin were shredded by bullets, they sucked up. A cold breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows this person, the trouble is big! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron, who had already gone, threw away the bones in his hand, and the men around him handed him a handkerchief. He wiped it hard and threw the handkerchief at hand. roadside. He leaned close to Klaus's side, hippie smile, and walked with a slap in the face. "Shuang, really cool, it's going to be so happy, or we slaughter Du Lin, then we go How about the mayor of Otis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus brows a fist and squats on Aaron’s waist, hitting Aaron Rolling up and squatting on the ground, he looked up at Klaus with a painful look. Klaus shook his shoulders and made the clothes look good again. He glanced at Aaron and snorted. "What can you say, what can't you say, there is no point in your heart?" He looked at it. Around the perimeter, the pedestrians around him evaded and his face was slightly better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached up and pulled Aaron up and patted his heel. He whispered: "There is no such thing as Doolin. I have already made people." Going to investigate this guy, feedback back the information...", Klaus's face showed a hint of dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he didn’t really see Du Lin at first, a foreigner who claimed to be a 20-year-old hairy boy, and he was not allowed to take it. ? He also sneered at the rumors about Du Lin in the city. At the age of twenty, the skill is as big as Abel. The number of people in his hands is ten thousand and he feels that he is invincible in the world. He has seen so many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a prudent manner, he arranged for people to go to the East Coast to inquire about it. As a result, three of the five people who were inquiring were inexplicably hanged. In the port, there was another missing. The last one called him for help. On the phone, he roughly said that Du Lin’s power on the east coast could only be described by the word terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Dolin's hand, there is an organization called the “Songxiang Association”, an organization with dozens of developed cities, each with one or two hundred members. These people are no different from ordinary people on weekdays and have their own jobs, but once someone calls them, they will condense into a terrible fighting power. Coupled with the protection of Du Lin's agents and the Navy, those who were inspected were solved by the export wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the call hit halfway, Klaus heard the sound of the door, and after a short noise and his begging for mercy, Three gunshots sounded and everything was calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, someone picked up the phone and said to him, no matter who he is, someone will always find him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Klaus shudder, and also understands Doolin, a young and ridiculous young mayor. The foundation is really thick, thick enough to him. I dare not have any big moves. It included this assassination and only dared to arrange in Nano Lindes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of their own powers, they are facing the power of their own power. This is the law of the Andy brothers' survival in these years. It is because of this rule and strict observance that they are still alive until now. Those who hate them continue to hate them, and those who look down on them still look down on them, but they are alive, not only alive but also rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he didn’t want his stupid brother to do something in Du Lin’s ear because he said something, let him see himself as a threat . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone may have a different approach to the threat, but the purpose is the same - clean the threat before it becomes dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron’s face was a little distorted by the pain, followed by Klaus’s face, what was said in his mouth, Crow Si Meng looked back at him and he had to close his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe they didn’t notice, just at the moment, there was a stupid country boy passing by them. In fact, even if Klaus noticed, it would not seem that the young man had anything to do with himself and what effect he would have on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man walked half a street and got into a telephone booth. Some of them painfully stuffed a twenty-five-dollar coin into the coin slot and dialed the number his brother gave him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, after the operator connected the line, the phone was picked up and he was picked up. He turned his back to the sidewalk and whispered. "I just heard someone say that I want to kill you. That person is about twenty-seven years old. I don’t walk when I walk. There is a man who looks very handsome and has a pair of gloves around. There are few people around them, you are careful... well, I know, I will go now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man patted the phone and patted the public The phone, unfortunately, the public phone did not give him a change. He complained that he came out of the phone booth and considered it for a while before he waved for a taxi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Andy brothers who just settled Abel quickly found a restaurant on another street not far away, the restaurant was empty, only the middlemost table Sitting on a person. Crowston laughed and walked over, and the other stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two hugged a bit and sat on both sides of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is things done?" asked the guy opposite Klaus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus nodded and asked the chef to have a roast beef with steamed wheat kernels and a few slices of lettuce. As he slid the napkin under the collar, he nodded and said, "He doesn't want to cooperate with us, so he returns to the embrace of God!" He said he laughed. "Chester, I said, only cooperation. Really a win-win situation, only when we join hands, can we securely occupy the public transportation of the city of Otis!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is sitting opposite Under his master, he was also regarded by him as Chester. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After meeting with Claus in Otis, Chester returned to Nano Lindes with Klaus’s statement and his own ideas. In fact, Chester thinks that Klaus said that there is some truth. The city of Otis is not a nano-Lindes. After all, there is no effective reference assessment for the future situation. The strength of unity is far greater than the power of dispersion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface, Abel will manage the operation of public transportation, and the private Klaus will clean up some people who will benefit from the water to ensure that they benefit from it. The common interests of all are not threatened or lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public transportation actually faces a lot of competition. Even if it has the right to operate, it needs to have sufficient force to deter it. It is not uncommon in Nano Lindes. These people bought a very old used passenger car, sneaked around and looted the profits of public transportation companies. This kind of person is too much in Nano Lindes. In addition to considering that the two cities are not far away, driving is only four or five hours away, and Klaus also made a suggestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He registered a long-distance passenger transport company and merged with Abel's company to monopolize public transportation in Otis from outside to inside. With Abel’s official connections and the fierce name of their Andy brothers in the underground world, there will never be a second competitor who dares to take food from their mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this idea was vetoed by Abel, and his bid to bid for the public transport operation rights in Otis was actually for money laundering, so he was able to propose every After a while, I changed my car and more items that seemed to cut my own meat, but he didn't tell anyone about it. He declared that this is his own retreat, but his purpose is to hope that through this company, he will make greater profits for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, Nano Lindes has a lot of black money flowing into the underground money laundering bank. He has long been jealous. With his own personal connections, why can’t he do it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are taking three strokes, and he can get rich if he draws two! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he used to suffer from no money laundering, he and the banking system have no friendship, so he has been waiting for opportunities. Until he had a whimsy, he found a doorway that others had not found yet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a series of operations such as old car refurbishment, and the number of passengers that cannot be counted, hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars of money can be washed every month. 20% of these black money belong to him, and there are tens of thousands of thousands of dollars in a month. Why not? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, he only saw his ambitions, but ignored the ambitions of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chester is almost five or six years behind Abel, and there is no income other than a fixed "salary" every month, in fact, according to Abel Regarding the degree of superiority of his men, Chester’s salary of one thousand a month is not too small. But as long as it is a person, there will be ambitions, there will be desires, and it will do illegal things, but only this income, compared with Abel’s tens of thousands or more of income per month, there will always be some people who are not so reconciled. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
