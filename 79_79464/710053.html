			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes there are some people on the side of the road watching, and this kind of grace is like not seeing. I don't know if it is because of too much grievance in the long-term monitored life that needs to be vented, or the pressure in the recent period is too great. In short, he needs a way to vent. Undoubtedly, tossing a lineman who deceives himself is undoubtedly a good way to decompress. He walked over to the little man and glanced at a small piece of sharp leg bone that had been exposed from the top of his knee. The sneer sneered a few times, and the laughing guy shook his body vigorously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, keep running, as long as you can run 100 meters from here, before you deceive me, I can not care about you, but also send You go to the hospital. But if you can't run a hundred meters, you know what you have to do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't say a hundred meters, even ten meters are Very difficult thing, the pain all the time to torture this poor fellow, his hands clenched his thighs tightly, staring at the blood oozing in the wound, and Du Lin suspected that he was not listening to what Xiuen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, when he burst into tears and looked up at Sin’s eyes, except for hate and fear, there was only a sigh of relief. Lift him up again, then push hard again. Poor guy, whether he wants it or not, his broken leg will bear some strength in the process of falling. This has nothing to do with control. It is an instinct that has accumulated over thirty-four years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once again fell to the ground and slammed his thigh pain, and there was a burst of cool sound in the crowd. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xu En looked up and looked around the crowd, these unidentified passers-by took a step back, he realized that he was no longer a detective, he He is the main person in charge of an organization, and he is also a "face" person. He glanced at the guy on the ground, licking his good leg and dragging him into the car. In the process, the guy struggled a few times, but unfortunately his face and the soles of Xien’s soles were intimately contacted several times before giving up in vain resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people saw it without a lively look, they naturally dispersed, and the two cars drove in and out of the city. The unlucky one lying on the bottom of the rear compartment was crying and begging for mercy, but this time it was like a temperament to erect a typical model. To blame can only blame him for his bad luck, hitting the muzzle of Xiu'en, and becoming a typical "example" for Xiuen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the car opened to the suburbs, the greater the pleading of the guy. He was afraid that when he went to the suburbs, he would kill him and then find a place to bury it. The more timid the person cherishes his life, if it is not inconvenient, he can't wait to climb out and ask for forgiveness in front of Xien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car finally stopped at the edge of the city circle, the outside of a road is the grass, if it is summer, there will be many shrubs and some A tall plant that obscures the wild. Xiuen dragged the guy from the back of the car, then took a cigarette from his pocket and gave it to himself, and then he took out the pistol. He said to the guy's other intact leg: "If you don't want to spend the rest of your life in a wheelchair, I think you should provide some valuable information, such as who gave you a wrong one. Intelligence, delayed the timing of my inventory check?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold sweaty hapless is only a little late to answer, from the time of the grace of the question to the beginning of his answer In the middle, it was less than five seconds. A bullet penetrated his thigh. The hot shell penetrated his thigh and stayed between his skin and the sand. He didn’t feel the pain of gunshots. To the pain of the burn, the body slammed, and a yellow liquid spilled from his pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second time, who gave you the wrong information, what is his name, where he lives, where he likes to go. If you Let me wait, the third time my bullet will penetrate your head, you have three seconds, now you can answer!", Xiuen raised his arm and looked at the wrist watch, have not waited for him When the first number was reported, the guy immediately returned to his answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is called William, who lives next to the 'Conrad Club' 200 meters north of the intersection of the 7th and 5th Streets. He is in the club every day. Stay in the night, you can find him there!", he rushed to the head of Xien, and almost let Shun shot his head and shattered his head. "Please, you see how much I drooled." Blood? I am very dizzy now, and the wound is already numb, I am very uncomfortable, please send me to the hospital, I feel that I can't hold too much time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Xiu En shakes his legs and does not shake off. He used a gun at the hapless to scare him away, then shook his head and said, "Not enough, not enough. Continue to say, I can not only be fooled once by you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes it is most effective to have such a barbaric law enforcement method away from the core of the empire, although it will make people feel that the work done by the grace is too much, but these people eat this set. Here, if the civilized law enforcement of the "civilized" cities like the core of the Empire, this guy will not only cooperate, but also very likely to find the trouble of repairing grace. The farther away from civilization, the more natural it is. It is precisely this kind of barbarism that is the most feared and the most convincing rule of life for people living here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
