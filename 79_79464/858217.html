			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xin Shige wants to say that he has not drunk, but it is obviously impossible. Whether it is for entertainment or for relaxation, wine is always a necessity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He not only drank alcohol, but also had a good drink and had a hard drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the eyes of eleven pairs of eyes, he nodded a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is nothing to be wrong, Mr. Xin Shige." Du Lin took the initiative to solve him. "It is well known that wine and water are indispensable in people's daily lives." Things, so we don't have to be embarrassed or embarrassed about these things. I noticed that the Prohibition Act was originally from the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I checked After some information, it is said that the church was banned because the wine can make people lose emotional control and control over the self, so the pope at that time thought that the wine was from the devil's drink. After drinking more of this drink, the devil's power in the body It will accumulate, and finally erupt, the devil will come, attached to these people who drink too much, and manipulate their bodies to do something that is not their intention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, gentlemen, I don't want to question whether some of the things in the theocracy law are correct. There are evidences, but it is a matter of course to move some laws and regulations from the theocracy. "Dulin smiled and said: "After all, we don't have Peter III!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he mentioned this Peter III, he included four residents of the emperor Laughing, this is a very famous story, a story used to mock the church. During the early period of the imperial power and the theocratic struggle, the imperial powers did not know where to find them, and then spread them out as a weapon against the authority of God. Some things can never be erased for generations even if they do not need to be deliberately spread and passed down. This kind of thing is called "classic." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter III is a young pope in the political period. He was left in office for only seven short years. station. It is said that when he was born, there were nine comets passing through the sky. He did not speak before he was six years old, but on the first day after he was six years old, he said something earth-shattering. He shouted the sacred pope in ancient times. The name is - Rossi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then he has been trained as the next generation of popes until he ascended the throne and became the supreme master of the entire Western world. If the naughty destiny lady is not joking with him, maybe his statue will stand in the cathedral of Sunrise City. It is a pity that Ms. Destiny does not like him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a ceremony, people need to let Peter III, who has seen Rossi, come to say something for everyone. Yes, it is such a legend, many people firmly believe that Peter III has seen the Holy Pope himself. People searched for Peter III everywhere, and finally found this guy in the group temple. At that time, he only wore a robe and pressed his butt on a maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter is a shame for the entire church, doing that kind of thing in front of the sculptures of all the popes and gods, and also found out if If Peter III is not burned to death, the majesty of the church will fall to freezing point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this very critical time, a cardinal stood up and he "save" Peter III. He said that Peter III was possessed by the devil, so To make such a thing for the beast, he is not sacred, but is tempted by the devil to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that Peter III, who escaped from death, was even more mad and stupid. He also sneaked in public, people tied him up and tied him up, and after a day he was awake. It is. People asked him why he would do such a thing. He told everyone that he just drank a lot of wine. In the end, he lost his control of himself inexplicably. Another will controlled his body and made a亵渎 sacred things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the cardinal who saved him, let him put him on the fire "barbecue", not burning, barbecue, saying that he still has residual With the devil's breath, the next time the devil will follow this breath to find him again and control him. Only the sacred flame can clear this breath, so he was placed a little higher above the fire, that is, the proportion of people who baked bacon was highly roasted for ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body hair including the skin was fumed, a black smoke from his body vacated, he did not even shout the strength, dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the cardinal - the next Pope, Ryan I, told everyone that the black smoke is the devil's breath, Peter III has been saved, people Putting Peter III down, he shrank and shattered every part of his skin, revealing the slightly white muscles of the flour. In this way, Peter III actually survived and became the first "faceless person" in the church. As for his future events, that is another A story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, the church issued a prohibition on alcohol, which is considered to be a devil's drink. No one is allowed to make wine, and to transport or sell. As soon as it is caught by the church, it will be labeled as a demon waiter and then purified in the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the origin of the church's prohibition of alcohol, but in fact, the reason for the announcement of the Prohibition Order in the early days of the Empire was not that they had or did not have Peter III, but that the full-scale war was just over, and all the localities were affected by the war. Many bankers and crops were burned by the fire, so The entire empire is seriously lacking in food. In such an environment, the empire enacted the first ban on alcohol, which is to eliminate the use of food that can save lives and make wine for a few people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As people say, the truth is sometimes not the truth you want. Compared to the interesting story of Peter III, the great Yaoxing Empire can still How can you trust a person who is hungry? How can I say that? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, under the impetus of the prime minister at that time, the imperial ban issued by the empire was put on the name of the church, and the empire was thriving and lived in peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Du Lin mentioned Peter III, the Sin Shige was finally not so embarrassed, but he still asked: "Mr. Doolin, you have not answered my question yet. "!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and continued: "If we locate a necessities in our lives, we will never do it." Isolating this thing completely from people's lives. Just like we need to breathe the air, does it make sense to locate the air as a contraband?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The empire issued a second ban on alcohol, the third ban on alcohol and even more strict bans, and I dare say that it is impossible to stop the circulation and sale of wine because people need it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Excessive suppression of people's nature can only play the opposite role. Even in the Imperial City, there are many bars and sales outlets that illegally sell high-alcohol, which is the trend."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The trend is unstoppable, I can't do it The umbrellas of smugglers, so that they can not pay a large amount of taxation for them, and the tens of millions of tax empire will not deteriorate this year, but it will not change much. People When you buy it, you still buy it. When they smuggle, they are smuggling all the time. So what have we got and what have we lost?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We got Like a false law, we lost a huge income, and we indulged a group of illegal activities around us, causing great security risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Gentlemen, I would like to say that Mr. Sinister has called me a umbrella. I hope that I am a 'criminal manager'. In a limited space, in the case of management and control, I will do the most in law and order. Ok, let the crime rate be minimized, then allow them to make a little money, we earn a little, people can get what they want and are necessary living materials, this is my explanation."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the constant response, Du Lin used a variety of interesting points of view or serious, or humorous way to make this hearing less serious than imagined. He needs to thank Kevin for his efforts. If he didn't help him organize the materials and write these answers for himself, the atmosphere might not be so harmonious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time passed, the last question was handed over to the citizens of the four emperors, who sent a young man to ask questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man is very polite, he first asked and introduced himself, and then asked a somewhat sharp question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, your reply is very exciting, I found that I like the officials like you a bit, you and the officials who only talk and do nothing The same. I have a small question here, I hope you can answer it for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and said: "Please say."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people smiled again. "I found that you have always linked the core issues of this hearing to the economy. Do you think that as long as you can create enough economic benefits, Even if the act violates the law, is it acceptable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is not very good, because he replied that his image and evaluation would be terrible. The impact of this because it goes against universal values ​​and moral values. But if he replies no, then most of the defenses he has done before will be vetoed by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the young man, and the young man looked at him with a smile. It seemed that he did not feel that he had raised a very difficult problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Du Lin has another world of information as his own heritage. He pondered for a moment, sorted out the ideas, and asked a question, a shameless It is also a very invincible question. "If there is a man who tries to create a terrorist attack to destroy the station of the Imperial City, but he has not implemented it. Now he can kill thousands of people without killing him, but he is still innocent. If you change to be you, do you choose to kill him now to save thousands of people, or wait until he kills those people and then dispose of him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
