			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So say...", Doolin squinted at Evan, who was sitting next to Albert, and the latter nodded. Du Lin stood up immediately. He walked back and forth a few steps. He was sure that the big beard Eric had the best problem. He wouldn’t react too much in the future. The essence of this world has long been clear, as long as the face is too good, no one cares about your eating is not too ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a decision and turned around. Albert and Ivan both stood up. Doolin’s face was full of smiles. He reached out and Albert. He shook his hand and shook it with Ivan. "Thank you for your pre-work. You know that I am from a foreign country. Because I like this city, I stopped here. I need some people to help me with some things. I I appreciate your professional ethics and abilities, so if you can, you can work for me for the next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert immediately agreed, it’s a thousand miles The opportunity, he has been to a bigger city, has seen a bigger scene, the giants he sees are often surrounded by small businesses around a small consortium, and these small consortiums are around Around the big consortium, the last big consortiums are around someone. People say that the Chamber of Commerce is so great, why not because the Chamber of Commerce itself is like a giant consortium? Every member of the parliament has many small consortia and small businesses, so the horror of the Chamber of Commerce has long been known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he also has the opportunity to touch this class, perhaps Du Lin’s wealth, status, and power are far less than those of the horrible giant. But Albert believes that with his help, with the help of more people, Doolin may not be as good as the commercial giants. He clasped Doolin's hands tightly in his hands, and his heart was filled with beauty for the future. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan is not as pretentious as the opera movie, what if the young man of Doolin thinks his modesty is real? He also expressed his wishes and longing for the future of the business as Albert did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the identity of the two sides has changed, then Du Lin’s attitude will naturally change. Before Albert was just an outsider, now he can be half a person. So he has different requirements for Albert. "I heard that there are many manager companies in the Imperial Capital? You can form one. In addition to you and Ivan, you also need to absorb some legal abilities. Lawyers, financial people with a certain level of understanding of economics and finance, as for how other people arrange your affairs, you only need to give me the list."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"You will let go of this matter for a while, then I will personally deal with it, first set up the company, I will buy shares.", Du Lin suddenly thought of something, he turned his head and screamed at Jose, "Go to 30,000 I can't let my friends have no place to live with cash."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although everyone knows that this is a joke of Doolin, I know 30,000 pieces. Du Lin may be similar to the three dollars in the pockets of the roadside, but Albert and Evan are still very touched. These 30,000 pieces are nothing to Du Lin. For Albert, it may be the cohesion of all his efforts over the past decade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Du Lin taught 30,000 pieces to Albert and put it in his hands. "Inside, you have bank mortgage money, another 5,000 yuan." It’s a pre-planning fund for the company. If it’s not enough, come back to me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert excitedly took a heavy 30,000 pieces from Doolin’s hands and took a deep breath. With a sigh of relief, "Boss, I am so okay?", he said that he first laughed. "You can rest assured, I will definitely handle the things you have explained!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a shot of his shoulder, like... an elder is encouraging a younger generation. "I have never been jealous of those who are willing to help me. You will find out later." "His eyes looked at Ivan." "Ivan, Albert said a lot of good things about me here. I hope that you can have a good time of cooperation. If you have any questions, you can come to me, but I hope that you will always be there." I won't come to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan’s eyes are a bit complicated, he saw it for the first time. When Doolin felt that Du Lin was so young, maybe he was rich, he inherited the wealth of a rich man, or the descendants of a rich man, and he felt a little bit "in addition to money". To put it bluntly, it was a slight hatred of the rich, but when Du Lin said these words, he realized that he had looked down on Doolin. His meaning is actually very clear. In the future work of the two, Albert will be the dominant player. He will not lead the company after he is Albert’s "teacher" or older than anyone else. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if the two people really have a contradiction that cannot be reconciled? Look for him as Dulin said, but not only to come to him to talk about the problem, but also to send a resignation. Because Du Lin clearly expressed that Albert will represent his will, in this case, there is a contradiction that cannot be reconciled. It can only be said that Ivan is not suitable for this group. He does not want Evan to bother him. It is best to quietly go away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can rest assured that I will assist Albert in getting the job done." Ivan must behave, and Du Lin patted his arm affectionately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending away the two, the Buddha who had been waiting for him had come over. He grabbed an apple from the fruit plate and took a bite. "You said yes. ", that Abihan has a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders, went back to the sofa and sat down, took out a cigarette and handed it over, both The Buddha looked at the apple in his hand and looked at the smoke in Du Lin’s hand. He could only put the apple down first. He took out the lighter and gave it to Du Lin before he gave it to himself. "When I was going to contact other Guar people in the morning, I heard them say that there was a rich Guar in the city. But the business that this guy is doing is not very formal, and many people who work for him have disappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Buddha said it, he couldn’t help laughing. "They said that you are selling people and have opened black mines. Although I don't believe in God, I have to say that God is on. How do they think about it so that you can arrange them?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also smiled and said that he did not care about the Buddha. Indeed, sometimes the concept is difficult to change once it is ingrained, but there is one thing that can easily change the situation, that is money. Money and power are different. When people face certain powers, they may choose to resist, but when people face money, they are often not so determined, especially when these people are poor. To change your destiny and want to change the family's destiny, the most indispensable part of the city is money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money is a manifestation of people's status and class, and people living here follow the city's special game rules. Once people find that working with Doolin is not only without the possibility of "missing", but also for changing their own destiny and family fate, even if there is a real "missing" danger, they will not hesitate to plunge in. There is a saying called poverty, and many people who are afraid of being willing to sell their lives, let alone work for Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimation of one or two models, to draw differentiation, the so-called rumors have no effect at all, but this incident also reflects another thing, Abigail and him The accomplices should "leave". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When can they meet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha’s fingers counted "There are still five days, they will go to Anwar first, then take a boat from there, hope they don't spit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
