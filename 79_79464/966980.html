			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is picking up his handkerchief with his old friend Barr and afternoon tea, and he is still very happy, after all, the new year. It only started a few days. At noon, he went to the palace with Bar and met the emperor and the emperors and princesses, and stayed at the palace to have a meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor did not like him, that is, the guy of Magus let the emperor lose his power, but the problem is that now the master is not the royal family, but the new party. It is. So in order to maintain what the royal family still has, the Emperor had to make a good relationship with Magus, and he took the initiative to let him have a meal in his magnificent restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has eaten in the past, after all, Magus said that he was also a Marquis. After the royal family killed almost all the Dukes and all the non-Royal Princes, The Marquis is already the biggest aristocrat. It’s normal to go to the palace to accompany the emperor for a few meals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His butler knocked on the door, and the chat between Magus and Barr stopped, both of them were a bit stunned and dignified. Under normal circumstances, Magus's housekeeper will not bother them, unless something big happens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in!", Magus sat a little backwards. He rolled his legs and reached out and arbitrarily bounced the sesame-sized pastry dregs on his trousers. Then I looked at the housekeeper who walked in. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler said to the two men after the ceremony: "The accident at the construction site in the eastern mountains of the city of Otis has caused an accident, causing the collapse of the already opened canyon. One thousand and one hundred workers and related management were buried in it, and the police area asked if they would organize some people to rescue them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of this sentence is Not how many people died, but in the second half of the warning zone, I want to move. The warning zone is the last line of defense against the invasion of the external forces and defending the imperial capital. There is the Imperial First Guards Corps, formerly the Iron Knights. Of course, this corps has not been a direct force of the royal family, either before or now. They belong to the direct joint guards of the core aristocracy of the New Party, and the total number has been maintained at around 50,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unit is not only the last firewall of the Imperial Capital, but also the blade that suppresses the old aristocrats in the north. It is also the cage for the royal family to run out of chaos. . Now this is very important. The police area that should not take the initiative to do something wants to move before the cabinet's decree comes out. There must be something else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Magus let the butler go out, he recovered his smile. He smiled and said to Barr: "Dulin is in trouble!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Du Lin has Trouble, it is a problem for him to make that military foundation. No one in the political arena will stand up and use this matter to attack Du Lin. It is because the Army is still very obedient. If even this small thing is going to be on the line, it will definitely hurt the Army's emotions and create unpredictable dangers. So Du Lin may feel that no one in this matter is dealing with him. Others don't know, or don't care, but it's impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything that is highly sensitive to the military will never think about keeping it secret. The deputy commander will report this to Du Lin’s promise. The military department was presented in front of Magus. Magnus did not have much to say about this, and he handled the matter coldly. When he came to believe that Du Lin would be a joke if he wanted to infiltrate the army, he would have no more money than the annual military expenses allocated to the army. That is, the two military expenses including the naval military expenses are clear to the army. Du Lin’s money is a small amount of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is a good thing to use Du Lin’s money to find a comfort zone for the first batch of generals who are about to retire in the new era. Du Lin’s fattening of them will make them feel that although they have lost their power, they will not lack the problem of money, and they will be able to maintain their decent, which can be changed to avoid any unsuitable signs. The Army’s emotions also have a positive effect. Even one day, Du Lin felt that the foundation would be too costly to do, and the cabinet would pick it up and continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who don’t use this thing to attack Du Lin. It doesn’t mean that Du Lin puts on an invincible iron suit. Soon someone will make a move to Du Lin. He made a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus went to the desk and made a phone call, and the cabinet’s staff sent an administrative order to the police area to send people to send equipment. It is also a good thing to rescue the martyrdom workers in the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doolin returned to Otis, it was already the next day at noon, and he even came to the outside of the mountain without a break. At this time, the guard zone came over. The soldiers had begun to clean up the ruins with the help of construction machinery. A fragmented body was placed in a black bag and placed outside the mountain. From a distance, there is a large black and white black spot in the snow, which makes people feel suddenly a little cold, but also really shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several managers of the joint construction workers came to see Du Lin immediately after they came. These people are also heavy in their faces and die so many people. They must be responsible for compensation as construction units. According to the current compensation method of the Yaoxing Empire, death and high disability, etc., completely lose the labor force and the amount of compensation that needs to be taken care of is about 8,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have already received the rewards check-in form on the day before the accident, a total of 1,317 people, if no accident, these people have already All died. Even if there is no death in the first time, in such a state of continuous low temperature, it is enough to freeze them all! This is a sum of more than 10 million yuan, enough to make the joint construction workers encounter huge setbacks! They need to discuss it and need to remedy it as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board has already sent a message. If you can't reduce your single loss to less than six million, they can find a place to jump off the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not look at them, but looked seriously at the scene of the rescue, he whispered: "Why is this happening? Before the start of work I have talked to you more than once, and I must ensure the safety of the construction process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person in charge here smiled awkwardly, he looked at his face The pale engineer, the engineer opened his mouth but didn't know what to say. His mind was still blank. Finally, the person in charge here said the reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of designing this temporary frame tunnel structure, the engineer had designed the load factor according to the maximum threshold, but he ignored one thing, that is, snowing . Perhaps he is not familiar with the meteorological environment on the empire side. Perhaps he feels that even if it snows, it will not become a "snow disaster". After all, the subtropical and tropical federations rarely see the scene of blizzard disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not incorporate the snowflake that fell into the palm of his hand and did not feel the weight. When the snowstorm came, Blizzard became a key factor in the tunnel. He had contacted the engineering department as quickly as he found the problem, but it was too late, and it was too late with a huge roar. He immediately paid for a speedboat and went straight through the strait to the empire, which appeared about an hour earlier than Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now his brain is still groggy, he does not know how to face the accident and the damage caused by this accident, he can not afford It may be a prison sentence that may be waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
