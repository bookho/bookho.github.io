Hold your emotions and interrupt him. The idea was to reopen a topic and ask him who thought that he was most likely to have created the attack.”, Anpu chewed the beef jerky, and his eyes seemed to be able to spurt light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he saw Du Lin’s genius performance. If he was in the past, he might be fooled because he has not encountered such a level of opponent. However, after being "killed" by Du Lin Guangming, his research on Du Lin was deeper and more researched than his case. Du Lin’s attitude of showing this kind of face-to-face daring at any time and anywhere means that he must have enough enthusiasm for him. This kind of qi is enough to support him even if he slaps his face and is able to resolve all the sequelae. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, he wants Adam to continue to ask him, then he comes to the table and finally proves that the attacker is not himself, or find the most powerful evidence. Proving that he has nothing to do with this matter will cause the Security Commission to fall into the trap he deliberately created. Once Du Lin left here, he will use the information on his hands to start a new round of layout. It may not use the Security Committee, but once it is used, the Security Committee will definitely suffer a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp is too familiar with Du Lin’s opponent, so he won’t let Adam follow Du Lin’s rhythm and give Adam a hint at the most appropriate time. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger on Adam’s face flashed away, the group of soldiers will not behave as “indifferent” as politicians, but this anger will soon converge. He looked down and didn't look at Doolin. "Mr. Doolin, I apologize for the words just now, then can you provide some useful information, who do you think is the most likely to do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp sitting behind the single-sided glass, staring at Du Lin’s expression, Du Lin picked up the cup, his eyes focused on the cup, and he took a sip of coffee. At the moment he put the coffee cup down, his eyes changed a little while he looked up at Adam again. This is a change that needs to be carefully observed to find out. The expression on his face produces some smile after the change of the eyes. "This is a very dangerous question. I am not sure who did it, if I give it to you... The National Security and Safety Commission points to a wrong path and is very likely to cause problems in your direction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let go of the cup stand in his hand and shrugged his shoulders. "So I am sorry, Colonel Adam, I don't know anything about the attack, and I don't have anything to say."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ask him if there are any more unofficial forces in the West, and have the ability to organize a joint attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Mr. Lin, with your knowledge of the West, is there any private armed force with non-official nature, can you organize such an attack?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin The mouth shook his head. "The person on the other side of the mirror has been telling you how to talk?", waiting for Adam to admit, Du Lin continued: "At first I thought you should be a great soldier, not anyone. I can become a colonel when I am two years old. But I don’t think that you have anything great at the moment. I’ll make a farewell to the colonel, and the Major General can also give it to you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I am very eager to ask, do you still have your own opinion? Or Have you yet learned how to speak?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp behind the mirror screams badly, when he just puts his hand on the call button, Adam squats I dropped the receiver hanging on my ear and slammed it on the table. Within the Imperial Ministry of Defence, many departments, including the Guard Investigation Bureau, belong to the Department of Defense's management system. Among them, the Security Council is considered to be a relatively high-level combat department. In addition to the combat information, there are also some aspects of intelligence. In addition to the Security Committee, there is also an Imperial National Military Confidential Information Service. coincide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of the Military Intelligence Division is to search for and find spies who have sneaked into the empire abroad, and to investigate and arrest some anti-government forces and forces that may cause imperial turmoil. Capture and espionage work. This part of the work coincides with the work of the Security Committee, and there is a competition between the two departments that cannot be seen by outsiders. This time, because of the particularity of the case, it was transferred to the Security Committee for investigation, but the requirements of the Military Affairs Office were also inserted. They also had a fight in front of the Minister of Defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final decision was to temporarily transfer the most recent Amp in the military intelligence department to the Security Council to assist the Security Commission in detecting the case. In this case, Amp The executive level is one level lower than the vice chairman of the Security Committee around him. Adding to the story of Amp, it is really impossible to say what is not. The vice chairman of the office of the perennial group gave the position of the host to Amp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of behavior is actually more responsible than the struggle for power. Amp itself has been working on the front line, and the detection rate is very high. It is always more effective than a half bucket of water. However, in the minds of these specific executives under the Security Committee, there is a bit of resentment. It is as if the Security Committee is not as good as the Military Affairs Office. It is obvious that they are making a contribution. The case is also attributed to them to detect. The commander is indeed the Military Intelligence Department. The people have accumulated some unhappiness in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Du Lin’s continual stimulation, Adam immediately attacked, and the set of the Military Intelligence Department did not work, then use the way of the Security Commission to solve the case. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed the table and stood up. The other side of the table immediately slammed into Doolin’s chest. Du Lin did not expect the soldier to be so “sinking”. Staying in the air, he wants to stimulate the people behind the glass curtain wall in addition to this soldier. He subconsciously thought that these people are all a system. If it is really a system, then Adam will certainly not attack, because the person who can command him is his real boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden onset caused Amp to stand up too. He quickly said to the people around him: "Let Adam come out immediately, and Du Lin can’t use it. The way, this will make him a madman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vice Chairman of the Security Committee on his side looked at Anpu like a smile, "Let him Give it a try, maybe his method is better than yours?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp wants to rush in, but he is not yet suitable to expose himself The information that is still alive, once Doolin knows that he is not dead, he can definitely guess that he is investigating him more or less, which is very unfavorable to Amp's next plan. He can only sit down with a cold face and hope that Doolin can grow a little bit more than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden attack on Du Lin was only reacted after being hit, and when Adam walked around the table toward him, Doolin stood up. At the same time, grab the chair behind him and smash it toward Adam. On the site of the Security Committee, no one dared to do it to them. It used to be like this, but it is not clear whether it is in the future, because Du Lin became the first one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam’s subconscious arm stretched out, the sturdy chair didn’t break, and the twisted side bounced between the two. Just as the two men's eyes were blocked by the chair, Du Lin pulled out the pen in his pocket and pulled out the cap. He rushed toward Adam and slid toward his neck. As for the dead? That doesn't matter, even if Adam was killed by him, he also has a way to get rid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next second, the two men's eyes met again. Adam had a layer of sweat on his back. He opened his fingers and grabbed the tip of Du Lin's fist. The pain of a heart suddenly came from his palm. The whole body spreads open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fight, Du Lin did not take it, but this is one of the few things he can be proud of in Ziwei Town, his left arm is gathered, elbow Turning toward Adam's forehead, he took out his hand with a pen and aimed at Adam's waist again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the strong block blocked Dooling’s elbow, Adam noticed that his hand with a pen almost had to stab his body and could only use his palm again. Go and catch. Only this time, his speed was not fast enough, his position was quite smashed, and the pen head was inserted directly into his arm. Du Lin stepped back and squatted on Adam's lower abdomen. He turned and picked up the table and yelled at Adam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when the table was about to get out of hand, he didn’t move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any took out the pistol and pointed it at Doolin, where the blood of the palm and the gun was combined and the blood slid down. He looked at the stabbed arm and looked at it. Doolin gives a feeling of wanting to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin put the table down, sorted out the clothes, went to Adam's face, gently put the chest against the muzzle, and said that the face did not change color, "Do you dare to shoot?", said that he also took out a pack of cigarettes, took a piece from the inside and gave it to himself, while vomiting, said, "No, you dare not shoot, you bear I can't afford this responsibility..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Award is also suffering in the heart at this time, he can't wait to shoot Du Lin with a shot, just like Du Lin said That way, he can't afford this responsibility. Not to mention whether the attack was made by Doolin, even if he did it, no one can kill him without a cabinet nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when his eyes were full of unwillingness, and when he was roaring with anger in his heart, Du Lin’s fingers were pinched with cigarettes, and the cigarettes were spinning in Adam. On the face, Mars is splashing. A bang was shot, but Doolin had already hid. He entangled Adam's arm and tried hard. At this time, there was no problem of keeping hands and not keeping hands. Only when he heard a bang, Adam's arm folded into an angle, and the pistol in his hand also fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the former vice-chairman was able to sit still, then after Adam really fired, he could not sit still. The big step of suffocating pushed the door of the inquiry room and watched Du Lin holding Adam's gun and pointing at his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
