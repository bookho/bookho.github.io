			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Geblin simply described the process of Walt’s debt owing, which happened from time to time, and not everyone could guarantee that they were at the table. I have been able to win and still win, not to mention the fact that his organization is really a "bureau". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You never told me this.", Natiya was very disappointed to see the silent Walter, she sighed, since Things have happened, so now you should not think about how to argue, you should solve things. Natiya is not a rogue. He can also see that Mr. Gabriel’s clothing is very elegant, and the behaviors such as repayment are definitely not going to work. She hesitated and asked, "Mr. Geblin, can I know how much money Walter owes you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Geblin From the arms, he took out a thick envelope. He handed the paper that recorded the debt of Walter and all the signatures that were signed and handwritten to Nadia. This is not how much he trusts Natiya, but He has enough means to ensure that even if these things are destroyed, he can get the money back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the date of each owe and the number owed, Natiya’s heart slowly sank, and she roughly calculated it. Mr. Geblin’s statistics and calculations are not a problem. Now, Walter has owed Mr. Gabriel’s 90,000 yuan. This is a huge figure and has exceeded her ability to pay. Even if she sold her house now, it would not be enough to pay the money – there is still a large part of the house’s loan that has not been repaid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This house is worth 120,000, and the cost of decoration and other uses more than 10,000, of which 70,000 are loans, in other words, even if she sells The house plus all the deposits, but also less than 20,000 yuan. She has just quit her job at the South Commercial Bank, lost the title of senior partner, and could not enjoy the mortgage-free low-interest preferential policy for insiders. Maybe she can try to borrow some from others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, she also found another problem, but now is not the time to say this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Gabrin, I don’t have that much cash in my hands...", Natiya is a bit embarrassed, and she has been assigned a lot during these years. The dividends, some of which are used as investments to maintain their image, are used in the process of interpersonal interaction. In addition to the need to pay the daughter's high tuition and fees in the aristocratic school, the other money is used to purchase the cash portion of the villa. In addition, before and after, in the past six months, she gave Walter nearly 30,000 yuan for "doing business", her bank deposits only 20,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was because she worked in the bank for so many years that she was more certain that the money was spent as early as possible, far more effective than in the bank, which also contributed to the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Geblin looked at the decoration in the house. He liked it very much. The exquisite decoration is simple and unconventional. It is the type he likes. These renovations also cost a lot of money. He looked back at Natiya, with a hint of indifference in his smile. "This is not my problem, madam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya smiled awkwardly, "I know, I know... Can I postpone the payment, or pay in installments?" She looked forward to Gabriel, and maybe the gentleman would understand himself. It’s a pity that Gabriel has never been a tolerant person, especially in the face of those who have lost their value. He shook his head. "Ms. Because this debt is getting more and more, I am very worried that you will not be able to repay it in the future, but I can provide you with two options for your reference." After obtaining the consent of Natiya Gabrin said, "The first option, I use this debt to buy the villa itself, and I don't bear any other expenses, so that you can not only solve the current financial difficulties, but also do not have cash. Too much pressure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second option, through legal means to solve this matter, the court evaluates your assets and then auctions, eventually raising The money I believe should be enough to pay off the debt. House, car, personal belongings..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which method is for Natiya It is a tough choice. If you choose the first one, it means that she spent more than 100,000 to buy and renovate the house, and 90,000 yuan will be sold. The loss of this far exceeds her bottom line, and the bank still owes tens of thousands of needs, and she may not be able to breathe in a year or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second option is even more impossible. She worked in the bank for a long time, so it is very clear that there are often many drawbacks in the auction game of the court. People will not participate in the bidding very tacitly. Originally, the value of 10,000 yuan can only be priced at two or three thousand. Except for the price of this villa is not too low, the value of other things is only two or three percent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She needs to raise the money to minimize her losses. "Can you give me some time? I will get back to you as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Geblin clicked. "You have three days to make a choice. I will come back in three days. During this time, I believe that you and your husband will not leave Sterley, right?", Natiya After a moment, Gabriel took a teacup and took a sip of tea. He stood up. "So we saw it three days later, madam..." He turned and looked at Walter and nodded, "Mr. Walter. "After finishing this sentence, he left." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-close the door. Natiya sat in the living room and looked at her husband. After a while, I asked in an infinite disappointment." What do you mean by business, are you cheating on me?" She has found that most of the dates on the owed are when Walter asks for some funds from her for the company's operations for various reasons and excuses. The money is honestly not much, three or five hundred, seven or eight hundred, and more than one or two thousand. She has always trusted Walter, and she also hopes that Walter can manage the company well, but she did not think that she is the stupidest one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt didn't talk, Natiya no longer asked, she went back to the bedroom and locked the door, sitting in the corner and holding her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next three days, Natiya keeps in touch with her friends, past colleagues and some relatives, but whenever she wants to borrow a little money At that time, those people can find enough reasons to believe that they are actually facing financial problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that lends her money to her is her parents. The two old people have sent her more than 2,000 yuan, which is because they do not affect their lives. Can take the most money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past three days, Walt has been at home and has not said a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the evening of the third day, Mr. Geblin came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it’s not just that he came alone, but also brought a lawyer. In any case, Natiya must make a decision today, he won’t take time. Continue to waste here, either to give up the villa according to his wishes, or to recover the money by prosecution, no matter which one will not continue to occupy his time. He still has a lot of "bureaus" to organize, and wasting time is tantamount to murdering the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Mr. Gabriin and his lawyer again at home, Walt did not appear, he rested in the guest bedroom, he did as much as possible in these days When he didn't meet Natiya, he didn't know what he should say. He knew he was a jerk, so he didn't want to make himself more annoying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Natiya, have you decided?" Gabriel took the teacup and wrinkled the tea soup and took a drink. I have to say that this cup of flower tea tastes very good, it should be the kind of private order, he likes it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya said with a little hesitation, "Mr. Gabriel, I raised more than 60,000 yuan in cash, and I’m still a little bit, can you How long will it take? I will be able to make enough money to pay for this debt." She took her car, jewelry and all the luxury goods to the bank to raise the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The luxury goods may cost hundreds of thousands of pieces when they are purchased, but when they are mortgaged to the bank, they may be only half of the original price, even It is one third. This is not how much the bank is, first of all, these luxury goods have been used. The real rich who are not short of money can't buy things that others have used, and that will make them lose their prices. Those who are willing to buy these second-hand luxury goods are often those who have a little money but are not so wealthy. They are not pursuing a first-hand experience, but simply want to decorate their own decent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they won’t make too high a price, it’s not cost-effective, and the bank can’t put the price on the normal value of the item in order to maximize its profits. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if there is more time, these luxury goods can sell higher prices, but now Natiya pursues this as soon as possible. The money can only be mortgaged to the bank as a garbage package. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Natiya, I have been granted a three-day grace to give you more time to raise the funds, but I also hope that you can understand, I Tolerance is not the reason for your delay. I am very sorry that I can't give you more time. You can make a decision now. Whether it is Option 1, or Option 2, this is my last come here. If there is any later, then It will be my lawyer to contact you.", Geblin picked up a small snack in the dish and put it in his mouth. He tasted it and couldn't help but pick his eyebrows. "It tastes good!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya stood up after a moment of silence. "I think I understand, can I make another call?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "That is your power, madam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duo Lin, who is far away from the Imperial City, is reading a book, reading in his spare time becomes a habit Until the footsteps disturbed him, he looked back at the butler who came over with the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
