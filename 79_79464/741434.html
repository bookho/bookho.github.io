			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Find Du Lin?", Prando felt that this was the only good news he got in the day, and that the guy in Amp was in the presence of many subordinates. The face was reprimanded so that his face could not be hanged, and he returned directly to the police station to be the "general contact person" and did some logistical work. For Amp, Prando's advantage of doing this is more than the disadvantage, at least he will not slap his orders, nor will he be constrained by his arrangements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to sending most of the police force to listen to the command of Amp, Prando has some confession to help him search for Doolin. Since the bipartisan high-level and central bank headquarters pay so much attention to this robbery, as long as they can promote Du Lin, even if he has a great ability, he will not escape the palm of these three forces. How to involve Du Lin with this case, he has no detailed and detailed plan, nothing more than planting it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this kind of person who has no social status and is also a "criminal", he believes that this private goods will not interfere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the person? How many people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old policeman in his forties The member bowed his head and stood on his side, whispered: "I just received the news that Du Lin and Xiuen colluded together and took the smuggled private wine back to the market to spread the goods, which touched Karur. The interests of Karur and their appointment to negotiate at the dock tonight, there are still a few hours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is the first Prando The object of hatred, Xiu En is the object of his second hatred. He has been carefully guarding against the repairs, but even this is still not able to block the opportunity to be rehabilitated, but he did not expect that he did not let Xien in the city of Tener did not play what kind of light, but inexplicably let him Was named as the director of the contraband investigation bureau. The purpose of controlling Xiu En is the suspiciousness in Prando's bones. He suspects that Xiu En has collected some evidence of his own crime. This kind of thing is not that there is no such thing. I would rather believe that he really did, and he could not hand over his official hat. Give luck to judge. In addition to the perceived obstacles created by Schneider's investigation into the transaction between Karur and the city's top management, he believes that Xiuen has hated himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a familiar smile on his face, a bit ugly look, but the smile behind it was really chilling. He was still thinking about how to solve this trouble after the return of Xien, but he did not expect that he took the initiative to reveal the flaws, and actually cooperated with Doolin, and there is evidence for this reason. The director of a contraband investigation bureau is actually mixed with the head of the private liquor dealer. It is even more daring to sell the smuggled private wine. He is really not afraid of others knowing what he is doing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando did not hesitate for too long, immediately wrote a note to the old policeman nearby, and carefully shouted: "I will bring this message to the captain of the gendarmerie immediately. I need him to cooperate with me to stop the crime this evening. In addition, the ridiculous brothers have a big move at night. When I get Du Lin into it, his brother should be gone, and the director of the Dongcheng branch is still yours!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He patted the shoulders of the old policeman, and the old policeman’s mouth was closed. The last time he said that he had to promote him, the result was stirred up by Doolin, and his hatred of Doolin and his brother had long made him hate to sleep. I will do this well, and he will come to think about it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other protagonist of the show tonight, Lewis, received a request from Karur and agreed to it, and then he found the house of the member alone. Karur’s request and Doolin’s collusion with Xiu’an were repeated. Lewis is a monk and a wise man. He knows that he is a dog. Without the dog's command, he will only be a dog, but he will never bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man was lying on a lounge chair with a cup on his body. He and the mayor discussed with him for a night before they developed a plan for the assassination of Xien. He heard the news from Lewis's ears when he had time to execute, which gave him a feeling of crying and laughing. It is as if an experienced hunter has prepared many traps for hunting a tiger. He has slashed his long knife and ready to go, but he was told that the tiger slammed into the stone and stunned himself, waiting for others to slaughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a helpless smile on the complex and changeable fate. He slowly got up. "I know, you arrange several gunmen, wait for Xiu and Du Lin." When they showed up, they killed them. After the incident, they went to Nabash to avoid the limelight, and there was just a shortage of people." The old man helped Lewis's arm sit up from the lounge chair, and the hammer hammered a bit sore. On the shoulder, "take away the people you think you have trusted. After the golden robbery, this place must be thoroughly eliminated. We want to maintain stability, but there are always people who want to destroy this stability. It is time to let them I realized what it is called horror."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp took his assistant and just came out of the bank’s archives, they found the seven days before Alisa’s departure Through the documents, there are a total of 19 different customers. Excluding sixteen outstanding citizens who have stable jobs, established families and have no criminal record, there are three people who have great doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first person was Hunter, a typical Ogdin, who opened a bank account here, and after depositing a dollar, his account would have no movement. There is no money to come in, and naturally there is no money to go out. If it is simply to save this money for a bank account, it would be easier to put this money under the bed. This guy has three pre-existing subjects, two of which burglary once to destroy the public property. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second person is Angela, a woman, this woman has no criminal record, she is just in a state of "victim". Her husband has a very serious tendency to domestic violence, and she has passed the production for this purpose, but she does not know exactly what the woman has never left her husband. Her husband used to beat her and let her go to a skilled woman and thieves under the threat of violence. Although it is not certain whether her husband has the guts to rob the bank, anyone who is likely or suspected is the subject of Amp's investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the third person, it was painted by Amp, this person is called Doolin. If it is purely from the identity information, this should be a little guy, but Amp from the police inside the file, but found this guy is simply a legend! Yes, he has never met a legendary guy like Dooling with Amp's knowledge. It took only half a year to stir up the changes in the whole city of Tener. If you combine the big things that have happened in this city, it is not difficult to find that when this guy named Doolin came to Tener, the city was not calm. In the intuition of Amp, he believes that even if the Golden Robbery is not done by Du Lin, he must have a certain connection with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he is a qualified prosecutor, so no matter how he guesses Dulin’s role in the robbery, he must come up with informative evidence. To be able to confirm that his point of view is not wrong, then Dolin will start. He handed the other two materials to the assistant. He decided to personally check the guy named Du Lin. He was curious as to how the kid did it. He stirred the situation at such an age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as several major forces in the city began quietly preparing for the evening peace talks, Du Lin was also preparing for the evening negotiations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things have been delivered, Jose is on the dock, what are we going to do next?", Ellis came back from the outside and took off his coat. The head is hot. It’s already spring, but it’s cold, but it’s not as cold as it was last month. The river also began to break ice, and the big ship may not be able to drive normally, but the smaller fishing boat has already appeared on the river to catch the fat fish that has spent the winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
