			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you use this stuff?", Graf’s hand was playing with a pistol from the police body. He didn’t really want to learn to use it. Weapons, just simply want to find something to let him ease the fear after killing. I am afraid that I will kill myself and I am afraid of myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he took the life of the policeman, he felt a bloodthirsty excitement, like a long-suppressed nature. Suddenly released. But after a brief excitement, he became a normal person again, became worried and began to be afraid. People always have infinite power at the moment they break through the boundaries of the law, because they do not need to be legally, morally and socially restricted to become another person, and they can free their personality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when they return from the boundaries, they will start to worry like Graf. The chain of law, society and morality entangles the most complete personality and fits into the deepest part of people's souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he needs to find something to attract his attention, rather than always thinking about the consequences of killing the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked this question very well, because the teenagers here are basically children of single-parent families - the fathers were forced to recruit to the front line as cannon fodder, It is for this reason that they have a certain understanding of firearms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf just finished, a child named West Morrick took the pistol from Graf and took it in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, you need to determine if you are using it, so in this position of the pistol, there is an insurance.", West Morrick pointed to the pistol handshake A small button on the front side, "Press it, then push this up..., you can shoot. But my personal suggestion is to find a place where no one is trying this thing, its sound is not small." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pistol of this world still uses twinning as kinetic energy. It seems that the whole world is rotating around the twins, even some large war machines need to be crystallized and " Steam" as a driving force. At the bottom of the pistol's handshake there is a closed fill-in bin, and the filled steam will kill the fill before the crystal heat inside is completely consumed. Pushing the small pusher under the insurance, the twins will be pushed into the catalyst chamber and begin to react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the trigger is pulled, the "bullet" that acts as a projectile will be pushed out by tremendous pressure to achieve a fatal effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet is a hollow metal cylinder with a diameter of only seven millimeters and a length of only one centimeter. The front section of the cylinder is tapered. This type of police pistol has a range of only 20 meters and has a firing rate of only two shots per second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more large-scale firearms in the military, depending on the way they are used, as many as dozens. Some of them can also be sent in succession, and the rate is said to reach a high speed of one second and five rounds. As for the highest speed of bursting weapons, it may be the heavy weapons that are often equipped on the AT-12 platform. The weapons have twelve barrels... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf quickly learned how to operate this uncomplicated small pistol, he played with it for a while, the wild rose bar appeared in front of his eyes . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the dark road of the previous period, after entering the city center of Tener, it is obviously much more prosperous. Almost all the essence of the city is concentrated in these three or four blocks. The carriage bypassed the main entrance of the Wild Rose Bar and stopped in the alley behind the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff who had been here for a long time immediately called out Mr. Colt, and when Mr. Colt saw Graf, he opened his hands. Go up and hug with this uncomfortable big man. When the two separated, he looked down and the clothes were a bit dirty. Although I was smashing Graf in my heart, my face was a happy expression. "It’s great. I have to say that your things are great. I didn’t think that I need to buy them so soon, then my things, Did you bring it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf took a few steps back, he couldn’t stand the hug of the guy who actually wiped the perfume, "Of course, money? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here!", Colt took out a check and handed it over. He has cash, but that is his own, and this check is Wood. Cheques, as the world's most widely used and most applicable medium, are almost integrated into all aspects of people's lives. The Imperial Central Bank has found a checkbook with a maximum of five dollars. As long as the number on the check does not exceed the check limit and there is a corresponding signature and password, the bank can redeem the full amount of cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf will not tell the true and false of the check, but he remembers what Du Lin told him, don’t worry about Colt not giving money unless he doesn’t want to see the second The sun of the day. This is not a boast. As a businessman involved in the gray business, which one does not have a group of "maintaining justice" helpers? Since Colt dared to sell private wine, he explained that he understood this truth. If he took away something that was not his own, he must be prepared to pay for the hand that was cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Graf put the check away, he continued to look at him. "And!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And?!", Colt snorted, "I I just gave it to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf looked at him a little differently, and saw that Colt had to see if there was anything in his body. The right thing. He performed very naturally. Naturally, Graf was thinking about it. But he really forgot, or he intended to show it to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The balance of the last batch of goods, your things are almost sold, the account of the knot must be closed!", Graf reminded, this The words made Colt so stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only wants to help Wood to return a hundred boxes of wine back, completely forgetting that when the restocking is also the time to check out. Private wine is not a legitimate business. It has been cracked down and sanctioned by imperial laws and theocracy laws. Therefore, no private drinker will let the buyer pledge as if he were doing a legitimate business. Every batch of goods must be settled immediately at the end of the sale. This is the law. I have never heard anyone who said that doing the crime is still staging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a small amount of money, thousands of pieces! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it’s not a small amount of money, Graf’s eyes become fierce and unconsciously, perhaps because of the killing of people, the killing is almost intense The point of overflowing from the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colt stunned and immediately laughed. "How can I forget? I just joked with you, don't take it seriously!", he finished Raising his hand and wanting to take a shot of Graf's shoulder is a habit. He feels that the shoulders of a person can prove that their status is higher than the other side, so he likes to shoot people's shoulders. But at this moment, the raised hand can't be filmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is like an invisible wall, erecting an absolute boundary between Colt and Graf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colter smiled and waved his arm. "You wait for a while, I will go to withdraw money now, so much money can’t be carried with me, only OK. When you arrive, I can come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This explanation also explains the pass, the fierce light in Graaff’s eyes is gradually extinguished, and Colt’s pace is very fast. Almost the door was opened and rushed into the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
