			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The literacy class was arranged, and it took a sum of money, plus Mr. Klein’s care, his daughter was very attentive. In this world where capital is king, rich people should enjoy the respect of people and enjoy the privileges of society. After all, money is the father of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the day, Doolin was busy staring at the blacksmith to make a large distiller, buying some necessary equipment and utensils, and attending a literacy class with the fellowship at night. I have to say that the text of this world is not difficult to learn, compared to the world-style text in the dream. Just like people can talk, know enough letters, and then know how to spell these letters, basically reading is not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest is to increase reading, memorize more words, and write. Every member of the fellowship knows that such opportunities are hard-won, and knowledge and money are expensive resources. For a fast literacy class like this, everyone has to pay a tuition fee of fifteen dollars. This money is really an astronomical figure for these teenagers, at least until they join the fellowship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a little money in their pockets, they will get their parents at home, improve their lives, add one or two clothes to their younger siblings, or buy them some delicious. So for those who can read and read literacy, every teenager is very serious, and no one needs to be jealous. They are as crazy as a sponge to absorb knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Graf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God is on, I think I am going crazy!", Graf, who secretly hid a bottle of wine into the classroom, sat in the last row, looking up The letters on the blackboard are twisted and twisted. He feels that his brain is big. He took a drunken look at Dulin, who was very serious, and asked, "Can I earn more money when I learn this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin I looked at him with a slight head and thought about it very seriously. Then I shook my head. "No, learning to read and write doesn't make you make more money!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf hit a cockroach and squirted a bad smell of alcohol. "What do I learn about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least Let you live with dignity and live decent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf laughed again. "Don't we say that before? If we make money, let those colleges be born to be our deputies, and then hire a few highly educated female secretaries, isn't it more decent?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded this time. He couldn’t wake up a drunk and unwilling person, nor did he have to change other people’s thoughts. There is a saying in the dream that is very right, do not want to do it. To put it simply, he is not a person who is willing to be controlled, so he will not easily control those who do not want to be controlled by him, except in special circumstances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf is not willing to be a literate, at least a person who can read newspapers fluently, that is his business. After these days and Graf's getting along, Du Lin felt that he had seen Graf through. This is a person with no ambition. His best job is to be a good man, and then spend the whole day on the streets, bragging and drinking. But I have to say that Graf helped myself, especially the forty dollars, and some other small things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For friendship, Du Lin looked a bit heavy. Graf would be his friend before Graf did not owe him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the contrary, he is very optimistic about the young man named Dufo in these days. Perhaps this has something to do with the Buddha. It is because of the helplessness and bitterness that we can understand the value of the opportunity. Whether it's doing things, or sitting here to learn to read and learn some words, Buddha is the most serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A serious person may not be successful, but not seriously..., he glanced at Graf, and he was doomed to failure. On the fifth day, Doolin let the Buddha focus on the construction of the farm shed, and he supervised the different blacksmiths in the city to build different parts of the distiller. At this time, Buddha suddenly ran over. This is something that has never happened before. No matter what Du Lin confessed to Buddha, he can always finish it meticulously. He will never leave what he should do as he does now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what must have happened on the farm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and the blacksmith explained a few words and walked out of the blacksmith shop. The cold air outside the house rushed over and let him burst into the water at the moment of alternating hot and cold. The feeling of suffocation. He took out a cigarette and threw it to the Buddha. He also ordered one. When the two men walked to the side of the road, Du Lin asked: "What happened in such a hurry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo took a sip of cigarettes and then came over and lowered his voice and said: "Morris brought people. He made a noise and said that Hu En had mortgaged him to him. He also said that he would see you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s brow grabbed it all at once, and the last thing he wanted to see happened. He also praised the Buddha before, saying that he was very clever. After seeing Huon go to the deli, he also knew to go in and confirm that Morris was absent. In Du Lin's opinion, since Hu En went, Morris would never let him go if he couldn't get the money, but the problem still appeared, but in the end it was a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and voluntarily left a distance, lest he disturbed Doolin’s thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about four or five minutes, Du Lin’s cigarette butts burning in his hand to the buttocks were thrown on the ground, butts hit the ground and Mars splashed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to understand, it must be that Huon took some money to Morris, temporarily pacifying Morris in this way, and then lied about the ranch To Morris. Morris got a certain amount of money and then added the value of the ranch must be more, so he admitted this way. After solving the debt, Hu En had already returned home with his family and some simple homes four days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s damn it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kicked the electric light pole around him and made a muffled sound, so that the pedestrians around him could see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a deep breath and summoned the Buddha. He took a roll of money from his pocket and counted fifty. In the hands of the Buddha, "This way, immediately arrange people to find out where Huon and his wife's home are, then find them and bring back the money that belongs to us. In addition, you go to tell Morris, at night in gold. The crystal bar meets, I wait for him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took another step forward, and almost all of them were attached to the Buddha, one hand directly caught The shoulder of the Buddha pressed against his shoulder. "Take a weapon, just in case!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha nodded hard and turned and ran. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood alone, and once again rose into a nameless fire in his heart, and he slammed the electric lamp post several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
