			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clear wind and rain, but it can not feel even a trace of dignity in the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood looked at the three bodies on the ground, his eyes filled with sorrow. The outside person said that he was a mob, a crazy butcher, but this does not mean that the butcher and the mob have no feelings. He is also a human being, and there are also feelings that human beings should have. He is happy, angry, sad, and happy. Both Jim and Jiji have been with him for a long time. These two people are more like him to his family than his family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it’s falling to the point where even the meat can’t afford it, or when facing a strong enemy, the two men follow him closely. Never step behind. Their existence has long been integrated into Wood's life, and can't be erased at any time using any method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now they are dead, and the body is in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to cry, but he can't find the feeling of letting tears break through the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a little bit of laughter, saying that when they go all the way in the world when they are white, they take a step forward and can’t enjoy that kind of beauty. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, they still suffer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the mood in the heart is like a storm of madness in his heart, he does not see anything on the surface. He was sitting back in his chair, his hands pressed against the back of his chair and his chin. He looked at the three bodies for a long time without any movement, just as time stopped on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the house, there are some people, there are more people outside the house, but no one dares to make even a little bit of noise at this time. They really want to know what to do now, but no one dares to open this mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the dull atmosphere made people want to go crazy, and Robben came out. He picked up the white cloth and covered the bodies of the three men. Wood's gaze shifted from Jim and Gigi to him. His eyes are deep, hiding tyranny and anger, but he is also calm and terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said, when you were a teenager, did you think that there would be such a day? One day, I, or someone else, or these two idiots suddenly left us and invested in the embrace of God." When Wood spoke The tone was very steady, and only Robben could feel the slight trembling in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roben thought about it and shook his head. "You should cheer up now, you not only have them, but also..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood did not let him finish the words, stood up fiercely, lifted the chair and squatted on the ground. The broken sawdust flew everywhere, and he lifted the seat back that had been shattered and forced it to the wall. With a bang, the back of the chair was also scattered and turned into a wooden stick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood walked back and forth a few steps, he pointed to Robben, but did not say a word. Going back and forth a few times back and forth, stopping and looking at Robben, "I want their bloody debts to pay, and send Graf's mother and brother to give them two idiots to be slaves!", this may be Wood. The fastest and the only way to get rid of it is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Robin did not move, still standing there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How? Didn’t hear me?" Wood’s voice rose and snarled and walked over to Robben, almost together. He looked directly at Robben's eyes and asked with a hateful tone: "I still think you can't tell me what you are doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robben took a step back and raised his palms outwards to the chest. "You have to calm down. Killing two people can't solve any problems. It will make the conflict more intense. I actually hope more than you." Let them go to see God immediately, but I was almost killed by them. But I also know very well, whether you want to fight in full or not, you must first find them."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now blindly kill Graf's mother and brother, in addition to let more Guar people become their accomplices, let them become more united, come to us There is no benefit at all. So, Wood, you have to calm down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking suddenly, the building’s cracked glass sounds, a group of people wearing Windbreaker, the guy with the dome felt chased out of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood and Robben both stunned, and then someone went upstairs to see it. In less than two minutes, the people who went upstairs looked down. They had a brick in their hands and a piece of paper on the brick. The man had a strange face and placed the brick on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood snorted and walked over and took off the paper on the bricks. The paper was written with a twist: all traitors should bear their behavior. As a result, you released her, then you will be judged for her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood read it back and forth twice, irritatingly stuffing the note into Robben’s hand. "Damn, what does this mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking a glance, Robben’s face became a bit ugly. He looked back and glanced at the three bodies covered in white cloth, and said, “In the guar. In the belief of the special person, the betrayer must be stripped of the skin for three days. If there is no death in three days, it means that she has obtained the forgiveness of faith and can continue to live. But if she dies, it means she is finally The trial."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This process cannot be interrupted. If someone interrupts the process, then whoever does it, who will come for that person? Accepting the trial!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roben is not a Guar, this is what he heard from others because Jim’s wife was peeled, which made He felt unbelievable. So he asked a person who had a little understanding of the Guar beliefs and only knew the meaning of skinning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many words on the note, but the information reflects one thing, that is, someone has to peel off Wood's skin. Whether this person is Du Lin or other Guar, it is not a good thing, which will seriously hit everyone's morale. He stuffed the note into his pocket and pinched it with his fingers, no longer seeing the third person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who ran out were also back, nothing, but they heard the guard said that it was a child, only 13 to 45 years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other and should be done by Du Lin’s people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We want to fight back!", Wood swung his fists hard, and this sentence made the spirit of the people in the room alive. Two important people have died. If they do nothing, they can only disappoint. When Wood said that he wanted to fight back, they almost all cheered. Wood walked back and forth a few steps. "Cut out where the two guys Doolin and Graf are hiding?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
