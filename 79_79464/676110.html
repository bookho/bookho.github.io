			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition to the old party’s Capital Threat Theory is of course the “innovators” of the New Party, whether a city is prosperous and the prosperity of business There is a direct relationship, which has been demonstrated in the past feudal monarchy. If a city is prosperous and its business is prosperous, it will be able to get more taxes for the development of the country and the development of the city under the relatively clear and honest administration system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same for both the New Party and the Old Party, but the ultimate goal and focus of the two sides are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businessmen can greatly arouse the trade behavior of a region. Only when trade behavior becomes more and more, can all aspects benefit. As for the absurd claims made by the old party that "people control the people to achieve the goal of controlling the country," the New Party absolutely does not recognize it. In the eyes of many "enlightened people", the capitalists' benefits to society and the country are far greater than the disadvantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalists contribute employment opportunities, and employment opportunities can reduce the number of unemployed people in a region, thereby reducing the contradictions at all levels and enhancing the effectiveness of law and order. The workers exchanged their hard work for money – there is absolutely no problem, the capitalists are willing to pay for the results of such labor, the capitalists get the products, and the workers get the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sale of goods in exchange for the circulation of money, the ruling party also obtained sufficient tax for the development of the city. When the city becomes better, it will be able to attract more foreign capital to enter, thereby gaining more employment opportunities, generating more goods, more people will get a salary, and the city's managers will get more. Taxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a virtuous circle, and the root of everything is the emergence of capitalists. Of course, the New Party has also established many laws and regulations to restrict the behavior of merchants, such as the "Minimum Time Pay Act" or the "Workers' Basic Security Law", as well as social organizations such as trade unions that spontaneously protect the interests of workers and prevent capitalists from making excessive money. Exploiting workers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that in the past, many places were implementing the original trading method of barter, the power of capital was greatly weakened and controlled by the regime, and nothing happened. Also lose a layer of wool, and let many capitalists retreat into merchants. They are reluctant to build large factories, are unwilling to hire too many workers, and are not willing to pay full wages for those workers. Only in this way can they avoid the miserable fate that may arise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in such an environment, is the development of the social system healthy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer is not necessarily, because in the feudal monarchy, in fact, many aristocrats’ own behavior is equivalent to the behavior of the current capitalist, but this behavior is draped in a certain Some coats are carried out in another form, so many people don't understand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In modern times, whether the power of capital is good or bad, excessive discussion is actually meaningless, but one thing is certain, the power of capital is rapidly Swell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler is a core member of the Imperial Chamber of Commerce, and he is the vice president of the branch in the city of Tener. As for why it is Tyner, it is because Although Ternell is very remote, it is one of the hubs of freight transportation, so a core member of a high-ranking chamber of commerce needs to be seated here. He is now just a businessman, and the mayor of the city needs to think a little about his own words in the process of chatting and chatting with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he understands, don’t look at him as a mayor of a city, but he’s not in the position of a core member of the Chamber of Commerce. What is especially good for you. And this is one of the most feared places of the old parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can call huge amounts of wealth to get through the joints, thus affecting the choice of political figures. Peter believes that if he made a loss to the imperial chamber of commerce Things that will benefit the whole world may not require his old father-in-law who is lying in bed to speak, and someone will come to clean him up, and he is still the old party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After half a day of gossip, the mayor finally began to point the topic to the core of today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler nodded without hesitation. "In fact, I can’t say that completely. I am a hybrid of the Guar and the Ogdin, my mother. It’s a pure blood Ogiltin.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor’s adult suddenly realized his head, and no one knows what he thinks in his heart, “I heard that Have you been engaged in charity and rescue activities for the Guarts, is this the case?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler nodded again, he could not veto this kind of thing In order to reverse his image in the eyes of the Guartes, he always helps the poor Guars free of charge. Although it is often the case that the Guartes are willing to starve to death and are not willing to accept his assistance in freezing, he is still keen on this. He also often takes out some of the guarants who have been imprisoned, or find a good lawyer for these imprisoned gualts to help them win the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing a lot of work, after spending time and wealth and hard work, finally a small number of people reversed their views on him, only a small number of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the idiot of Graf is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor’s finger pushed back and forth along the cup of the cup, and he glanced at Heidler and asked, “I heard that you and a man named Doolin The guar in the countryside knows that this guy created a fellowship and opened a trade bank. There are several pieces of Prando involved in his murder and injury case being investigated. What is your relationship with Doolin? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler said with a discretion: "He is a very optimistic younger person and very interested. He found me to build a group for help." The Guar, I believed him and gave him some financial assistance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of the mayor’s adults are actually Heidler The last thing I want to hear is that he is a Guar, the Guars don't like him, and the Ogildins don't like him. He is always careful to avoid giving his opponents any chance. When he heard that Prando was investigating Doolin, Heidler breathed a sigh of relief for his foresight. But he is still very careful, he is not sure if the mayor wants to use Doolin as a springboard, and then let the stick fall on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The struggle in the Chamber of Commerce is not weaker than the political struggle. There are so many seats for parliamentarians, representing the concentration and dispersion of the power of the Chamber of Commerce. . In the chamber of commerce, the strength is stronger than that of Heidler, but not the big businessmen of the parliament are not one or two. The reason why he was selected was also thanks to his guar identity, just like the other two provincial councillors. From the most primitive pursuit of profit, it is extremely beneficial to attract two representative foreigners to enter the Chamber of Commerce, which is also very beneficial to the promotion and work of the Chamber of Commerce. But this does not mean that others will give up the possibility of being black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in the face of a possible crisis, Heidler, as always, like a mature businessman, chose to weigh the pros and cons and then trade. Although he feels a pity, if there is no such thing, Du Lin is very likely to become a big man in the next 20 to 30 years, but it is always "if"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you not think that Doolin is my person? Very good, then I will give him to you, so that always can elute my suspicion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should know that I am a legitimate imperial businessman. I have never done anything illegal. For Du Lin, you mentioned, I know him. He is full of temptations to convince me that he will establish a fellowship. In order to better serve the Guar people, but I did not think that he is such a ferocious mob. Please rest assured, if there is anything I need to cooperate with, I will definitely cooperate with the end.", Heidele smiled and will Lin "transacted" out to exchange his innocence, just as his father and himself had done countless times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor’s eyebrows picked and raised, “Thank you for your support of justice, I will talk to Prando.” He said it was over here. At first, it seems to be thinking of something. "Right, do you know a guar named Jon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know!", Heidler The reply was very fast and very decisive. At the same time, he asked with a little curiosity: "The name has been almost filled with the streets of the city for a while. I am very eager to ask, I can know what Jon did. As for the whole city, I am looking for him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor’s face always has a good-hearted smile. "Nothing is not important." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the silence of the parliament, the mayor said: "Thank you for being invited to the busy work today, thank you very much, the conversation between us is very good. Pleasant, I am looking forward to the next coming.", the mayor’s adult should say that he has finished asking, he is here. , Heidler also stood up, after the two men shook hands, Lord Mayor Heidler sent out the office door was respectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to the office, the mayor carefully thought about it. He thought that the relationship between Heidler and Doolin was definitely more than Heidler’s own. Say, and as shown, the two may have deeper connections and relationships. It is very likely that Du Lin is Heidler's white gloves, and he is doing something for him that he can't do well. Even the appearance of "Jon" is the arrangement of Heidler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the purpose of his doing this? Every word Heidler said, the mayor is unbelievable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After standing by the window and looking at Heidele’s own car, the mayor turned back to his desk without any hesitation. I wrote a few lines of words, and after I folded it, I taught the maid. "Take it to Prando and ask him to do it himself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
