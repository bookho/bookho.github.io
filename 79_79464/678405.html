			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two requests made by Dooling do not seem to have any problems in Prando. Only by doing this will Dolin believe that he really just wants to solve it. Trouble, but Du Lin's two requirements are somewhat unbearable, and can even be overstated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His third request was to use his own person to imprison himself. To put it simply, he asked to be detained in the Dongcheng District branch. Everyone knows that Mason is now the director of the Dongcheng District Branch. He can ensure the safety of Du Lin. The problem is that if Du Lin is detained in Dongcheng District, where will the regional police station be placed? This incident was made by the mayor of the city, allowing Prando to do it himself. It was not for him to ask others to do it, so Prando insisted that the place of detention must be placed in the regional police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the third requirement is excessive but there is still room for discussion, then the fourth point is really hard to accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dooling asked Prando’s family to live in the country for a while, and this is also the core requirement. Although Du Lin can't guarantee that Prando's "Gujia" behavior is from the heart, or a socially responsible performance, only this method can make Du Lin more reassuring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the countryside is concerned, it must be where Mr. Xerma lives. Doolin also promises to make Prando’s family an unforgettable “holiday”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the last question is deadlocked here, and neither is willing to give in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you insist, it will make me have no choice." Prando threatened Doolin with a hint of implied, although the public service also exists. It’s dangerous, but it’s better than taking the initiative to send your family to the other’s mouth. What if Prando complies with the agreement, but does Doolin not comply? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Prando’s slightly tough answer, Doolin also shrugged his shoulders indifferently. He spread his hands and revealed a piece of what to do with you. The expression, "Then you have to make sure that you don't let any fellow members of the fellowships kill us all." He laughed when he said, "We are all bad, if we are hugging the Pluto. I can still go to hell with some big people, I think this sale is not a loss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluto only exists in hell, Doolin does not think He is a good person, so he cannot hug God after death, and God will not embrace him. Only hell is his home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no room for the buzzing dialogue. Prando said that he was officially involved, and Du Lin responded with tragic retaliation, which made Prando fall into a difficult choice again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once his family is in the hands of Doolin, he will lose a lot of initiative, and the ghost knows if this madman will cut off some of his family’s roots. Fingers, or dug an eyeball as a means of coercing him, make him a beggar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you don’t choose this, how can you do it, and complete the task of the mayor’s account? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, man, I’m asking for my approval. Isn’t you showing your sincerity?” Du Lin handed another cigarette. In the past, "As long as we act according to the plan, then in the end we will not receive any harm, I will swear by the king!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struggling for a long time, Prando He could only nod his consent. He threw the cigarette that he had just taken a sip on the ground, stood up, and lifted his foot and grinded it. "Remember your words, remember your vows, why should I hate you so damn?" "When he turned around, he kicked the chair that he had just made, and the Buddha who stayed outside the door pushed the door open and slammed in." Prando pushed the Buddha away and put on his hat and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha looked at Du Lin, who was in good condition, and rolled his eyes and turned over the chair on the floor. "How? Is it related to me?" "", because he stayed outside the door, did not know the situation inside, plus Prando came to visit this time, he thought it was related to his own affairs. He is not afraid of pain, nor is he afraid of going to jail. The problem is that if you can't bear these things, who is willing to take the initiative? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head with a grin, and he pointed to the Buddha saying: "You are fine, now there is something for me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first morning of the third day, several police cars were surrounded by the Eastern Star Trading Company. Prando took the lead and stood outside the store with a loudspeaker. Shouted inside, "According to the laws and regulations related to the Imperial Law, Du Lin, now I officially inform you that you and the main members of the fellowship were arrested for murder, assault, smuggling, kidnapping. You are only now The road to confession can go, any resistance is meaningless!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin standing on the second floor looked helplessly on the street Prando, swearing a swearing, then changed a suit, put the pistol installed, and slowly walked out from the door with more than a dozen fellow members. He raised his hands and walked on the first one, and Prando immediately rushed up, untied his handcuffs from his belt, grabbed his hands, and covered his hands and hands with Doolin's own clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the clothes, Doolin turned his wrists and his hands shrank back from the almost completely unbinding handcuffs. He put his handcuffs into his pocket, pretending to be bound, and frustrated with Prando. Deep, he was pushed into the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrest attracted a lot of attention, surrounded by many people around, some of them are watching the lively, some people’s eyes are Wearing an anger and hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These police cars screamed and left soon, leaving only a few girls standing in the store and looking at the police car far away through the window, a godless appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police car quickly rushed into the compound of the regional police station, and Mason greeted Du Lin. Regarding Article 3, the parties finally resolved this issue under the "friendly" consultation. For the time being, in the identity and name of the director of the Dongcheng District Branch, Mason joined the “Fellowship Association” investigation team as the deputy leader, and was also the principal responsible for the detention and interrogation of Du Lin and members of the fellowship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrangement is acceptable to Doolin. He believes that Mason’s sense of justice is so rampant and he will not start his own brothers. At the same time, he can meet the requirements of Prando. At least Du Lin is detained in the regional police station, so that he and the mayor can have a decent account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect that one day I will lock you up as a policeman!", talking about this, Mason has some eyebrows dancing, for a long time, grams The brothers of the Sma family have also been keen on the naive game of "police catching thieves". Compared with those younger brothers, Mason is always playing the bad guy, and he is still stupid enough to always throw himself into the net. Bad guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, his role is exactly the opposite of what he played in childhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the police! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is a bad guy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to laugh, or want to tell this to others, then you succeed." Others refer to other siblings "But I always believe that I am not a bad person, I am just incompatible with this society!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two entered the back of the regional police station for short-term detention The place, we need to understand Prando, he can use part of the black money to pay for the welfare of all police officers is already a very conscience black police, then do not expect him to take some money from his own pockets To repair some of the facilities of the police station. The room used to hold short-term criminals...not so much a room, it is better to say that it is a cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
