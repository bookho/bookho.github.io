			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden arrival of the war temporarily suspended the referendum in Saint-Louis and several other cities, and everything in the war will serve the war. It is something that every country writes on the constitution. If you study the world history of the world, you can discover that almost all ethnic tribes in each country have started a never-ending war since the great destruction. One dozen is two or three thousand years. The whole world history is a history of war evolution. All science and technology and civilization are for war service. Even in a few years or a dozen years ago, places outside the northern continent were still in full swing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every country has a dog brain, not the country is dying today, that is, the country has armed opposition, and anyway, if it does not fight a few times a year, They are not people in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the Commonwealth, there is a similar constitution, which is to follow the ancient system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referendum was forced to suspend, the plans of the new generation of consortiums were lost, and even worse, Sail and others who have been reluctant to talk to them are willing to They talked about it. But everyone knows that the initiative in this conversation is not in their hands, they may not even have the power to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the valley, by the lake, the quiet scenery makes the people who enter here calm, they seem to be sitting peacefully at a huge open-air table. It is the kind of table with a large number of relatives in the family. It is a table that is often used for dinner on weekends. It has an elliptical shape and can add up to ten or twenty people on both sides. Mr. Sail sat in the first place in the north. He was recently proud of the spring breeze. A combination of punches reversed the decline of the nation-building and gained more power and release. With more space, facing the war between the new and old consortia, the balance has been completely pressed against his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Sail and everyone greeted each other, then sat down and started the negotiations. "Gentlemen, the war is coming. I am very sad." I tell you that this war is unavoidable. The federal government has had a lot of problems in recent times, letting the outside world think that we are weak, weak, and can humiliate us at will." His tone is a bit deep. These homes always have a good voice and are very infectious. He looked around and continued. "This is a plot of the empire. They want to take us down when we are weak, and step on us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Do you agree? Will the federal people promise?" The muscles on his cheekbones shook a little, letting his eyes fall back, and a narrow gap was revealed in the narrow slits. "No, resolutely not!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He speaks faster and faster, "They want war, good, then give them war. More than twenty years ago we Being able to almost disintegrate this empire, then today, twenty years later, we can also take up the weapons of defending freedom and power and let them know that even if they have been chasing us for more than 20 years, they are still not our opponents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a new era, an era of progress, but please don't forget that peace is exchanged by force! This war must be played, and "It’s beautiful to play."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Joint Parliament decided to mobilize the First, Second, and Fifth Army to go to the border to stand by."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know why you are sitting here today, I know what you want Things, but the current situation makes us unable to discuss these things for the time being. Only when the war is won, can we continue to talk and make sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"here I have a request and I hope that you can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, you, all of them are federal people, no matter whether we have any differences All of our purposes are to make this country richer and stronger. The war is about to break out. As a group of people like us, we should have more obligations than ordinary people to face this war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone wants to say something, Mr. Sail directly rejected his speech and gave him a look. "I will make my most love for several grandchildren, and they are the most front-line troops. I have shown my loyalty and blood to this country, then should you also show it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a slight smile, "Don’t talk about money, Put people on the front line, let me see your determination, loyalty And the determination for the country!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today your choice means the integrity of the negotiations between us tomorrow, at least let us know, although our positions are different Your purpose is also for the freedom and prosperity of this country!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr. Sail finished speaking, both sides of the table fell into silence. Not only were the new generation consortiums closed their mouths, but even the nation-state was closed. Mr. Sail is very good at playing. Not every family has so many descendants who can take it out and throw it into the battlefield. Some family blood vessels are not prosperous. Big cats are two or three, like the new generation. On the consortium's side, some are a child, and not a case. This means... If they want to continue talking, they must first send their offspring to the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield, how terrible the place was in that place was killed by the bullets in the front, or was killed by the bullets in the back, really said no Clearly, even a bad reputation that was killed by a deserter was planted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it worthwhile to talk about it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same group of people who built the nationality secretly bite their teeth at this time. Mr. Sail did not inform them in advance that they are now very passive, because Mr. Sail said It is his most loved grandchildren. The things inside these big families may be very mysterious in the eyes of ordinary people. But for these people of the same class, there is actually not much secret. Who is favored, who has the hope to inherit the family, everyone knows well, Mr. Sail is to break the roots. It is very troublesome to train a qualified heir. Some have been trained for ten or twenty years, but now they have to watch them go to death... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Sauer has done this. If they don’t do it, they may lose more power. This is Mr. Sail’s forcing everyone to bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, someone responded. "I agree. I have four grandchildren, one, and the other three are all on the battlefield. I am a federation." People, I have fought for the federation, and my children should fight for the federation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail nodded, "This is our responsibility, many people question The power in our hands is appropriate, but we ignore what we have paid for this country. I thank all those who fight for the country!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one agrees At this time, the objection is to find death. Everyone can only bite the teeth and accept this. This makes Mr. Sail very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is only the first step. When the war situation begins to deteriorate, he will ask all localities to force enlistment to resist the invasion of the empire, and there will be more People join the army, and maybe even the heads of young consortia! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
