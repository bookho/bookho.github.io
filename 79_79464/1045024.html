			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duo Lin is not in the western part of the country, except for the members of the organization who were sinless and released from the army’s smuggling He contacted Carlos and other consortium representatives who had a very close relationship with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Mennon’s own ideas, he wanted to drive the group out of the west and let them have nowhere to go in the west. When he was threatened, no one of them stood up to help him out. The silent development of the situation looked like a partner who was already able to do his best. This is a betrayal. This is the betrayal of the red fruit. When it was just released, the doormen had already thought about several ways to keep them from working in the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when reason once again has the upper hand, he knows that he may be imagining that venting is the only viable way he can do now, no matter who is betraying him, Still hurting him emotionally, the only thing he can do is to smile and bring these people back to their camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an indispensable part of wanting to gain a foothold in the West and have sufficient funds and appeal to plan the future of the West according to your own vision. . The financial resources of these people, the networks and forces behind the group companies or consortia, and their local economic contributions are things that the farmers cannot refuse. He needs help, these people are the best help. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After the West Mine’s high-level absconding, the ownership here was taken back to the City Hall of Vanlier, which was originally scheduled to be re-auctioned or tendered in the second half of the year. Sold out. But I have a new idea recently...", walking on the golf hill behind the West Rail Association, the green and blue sky in the eyes always makes people feel comfortable and happy. The fresh air makes people feel that breathing is a pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mennon and a few consortium representatives walked on this lawn, the sun was shining on the body very comfortable, taking advantage of this good weather, he took these The person who betrayed him also agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman took a place with a slightly higher elevation and stopped there. "At the time, the West Mine would spend the facilities and buildings here." A lot of money, they also invited a blueprint designed by a very famous design master. If you sell it here through auctions, or let others operate, it may be better than now, but more likely to be maintained. It doesn't change or gets worse." Several people's eyes were focused on him. He grinned. "In this case, I decided to run this place by the City Hall of Villier and build it here. The best leisure, sports, wellness and business centre in the West."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to some low-rise buildings in the distance. "I plan to rebuild the land, build a shopping mall with a lot of people, and build cinemas, libraries, art galleries, etc., and strive to make everyone here in the west know." A good place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan of the Mennon has attracted the attention of these guests. When the West Mine will take the land, Vanlier has not yet been today. This kind of prosperity, this land is located next to the city center, between the ring line and the second ring line, it can be said that the location is very good. It takes only ten minutes to get to the town hall or the city center from here, and it won't take long to walk. It would be a good idea to build a high-end commercial center with the core of the West Mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The West is not short of wealthy people. The big and small miners and some successful gold diggers have money in their pockets. Money is a huge amount for them. The digital games, they are also very open to the concept of consumption. As long as they can make them feel that they can spend money to be happy, then they will take the money out and throw it out. They don't care too much about the price, they need to enjoy it, and the lack of enjoyment in the west will make this a holy place for the rich! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos slightly bowed his head and then looked at Clilan and Sandra. Today, the people who are invited by the Mennon are mainly three of them, they are three There is a huge consortium behind the individual, and it can be said to be the top one in the West in any aspect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra looks like she is laughing, her eyes are like laughing, but I don’t know why she feels that she is not really laughing. For Carlos, it is very obvious that she pretends to be invisible, and Clarence is somewhat heart-warming. There is no doubt that the Mennon asked them to come over and stand on the land where the ownership has changed. The purpose may be to pull the investment, or to give them benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are golf courses, tennis courts, swimming pools and more complete facilities that are readily available and beautifully decorated, without any changes to a brand Directly put into operation. The surrounding land reform will also be a huge profit point, whether it is undertaking engineering, providing materials, or investing directly, can make a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has money and hatred, even those priests, do they often hold boxes everywhere to seek good-hearted donations? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doormen took their little tricks in their eyes and said with a smile: "But you should all know that there is no problem with the funds in the city hall, but most of the money. There are already places to use. If the money is arbitrarily affected, it will affect the overall planning for the next one to two years, so I sincerely invite three people to invest in this plan."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My estimate is that the total amount of funds required for the renovation of the surrounding land and the surrounding land will not be less than five million. The land provided by the City Hall will occupy at least 30% of the shares, and the rest will be based on your investment. The proportion, the distribution.", the doorman said in a tempting tone, "This opportunity is very rare, definitely a big project that can make money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After listening to the three, the three people know that this is the doorman who is sending money to them. It is only the headquarters of the West Mine. When it was built, the construction cost exceeded 3.8 million. Now it has a complete set. Equipment, say less than five million. They are not clear about the price of the surrounding land, but the total price will not be less than three million. In other words, this is tantamount to a good thing that sells half a half. And after all the renovations are over, there will be a long profit period in the future. At most three years, their investment will be fully recovered and generate considerable profits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, it’s enough to say that, the rest of the things that the farmers believe they will consider at their discretion, not everyone can bring them so significant profit. Don't look at the representatives of these consortia, the representatives of the group companies. They don't have a lot of wealth. It is already a great thing to get together five million. It is precisely because of this, so the door farmers believe that they are sure to be heart-warming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Mayor, I recently invested in a water plant business and now have too much liquidity. Your project is very good to tell the truth. The problem is that I don't have to be able to pay much money at a time. So...", Sandra smiled apologetically. "I will not participate in this project for the time being."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer initially suspected how many people with more or less contradictions and differences between them came together. He felt that there was another person or a force outside of these people. They are brought together by means of mediation. Just now, Sandra’s investment in the water plant suddenly let the tenant know who is behind him – except for Du Lin, no one else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire western region is now able to do business on the waterworks, and only Du Lin and the investigative team. The people in the investigation team are all from the Imperial Capital. They will not stretch out the things that are not their own in the West, nor will they look at the things here. There is only one possibility left now, that is Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I thought of this name, there was a very clear figure in the head of Mennon. This person always made his hateful teeth tickle. If Doolin and the leader do not get rid of it, the harm to him can be too great. But now is not a good opportunity. Even if he says that Du Lin’s father is the leader of the bloody dawn, I am afraid that not many people believe him. Those people will believe that this is the opportunity for the farmers to use this opportunity to eradicate dissidents. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
