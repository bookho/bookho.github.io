			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it what you did?", Harry's tone is very bad. "Can you use your smart brain to decide what can be done, what?" Can't you do it? You actually killed Todd? Do you know how to report this in the newspaper tomorrow morning? Do you know what citizens of the entire empire will think about this? You are too much, Du Lin!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as a big thing in Nano Lindes. When all the gunshots suddenly stopped, a group of policemen came to the villa area in the dark, and then they saw a neat row of bodyguards in the yard of the villa, and a squat on the ground with their heads against the ground. Guy. There were two daring ones, ran over and patted the man's shoulder, and the guy kneeling on the ground lost his balance and slowly slammed to the side and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is dead, died of blood loss, or may die from being unable to breathe, perhaps both. The cut throat does not make people die immediately. From Todd's last kneeling position, he may want to pour out the blood flowing into the lungs, but he failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the consent of a higher-level administrative official, the forensic doctor of Nano Lindes did not dare to rush to find his death for Mr. Todd’s anatomy s reason. Anyway, he is already dead, and the rest of the matter has nothing to do with these people, perhaps it is no longer important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news was quickly fed back to Harry through the Police Investigation Bureau of Nano Lindes, and Harry heard that not only Todd was killed by a single attack. All his confidants died of the attack, and both illegitimate children were finished, and immediately knew that things were getting bigger. In addition to the discovery of the chip from the scene, faintly pointing the behind-the-scenes manipulator of this matter to Doolin, only the city of Otis would have such a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a trivial matter, even to Harry himself, once someone accuses him of being vulture between the mayors of the governor, he is very It may be wearing a hat of "unknown people" and "management imbalance", which can cause great obstacles to his pursuit of the supreme position. So he called Du Lin for the first time and waited for the other party to speak out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His angry tone hides a grievance that is hard to detect, and is negotiating with several businessmen about investment issues, and the result is a phone call. From the cool to the end, the feeling is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Harry was almost there, Du Lin interrupted his words. "Grow away? Harry, although we are friends, but you call me in such a private time to attack me in vulgar language, you must give me a reason. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reason?!", Harry laughed out loudly. "You killed Todd. This is the reason. Is this not enough?" He called and told me that there was a contradiction between you. You killed him in a blink of an eye. What reason do you need to give me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin The tone is as calm as before, and there is a very calm feeling. "So Harry, what about the evidence? You have to understand that the empire is a country that measures the standard of conduct by law. You can put any stain on me. But one thing, you have to produce evidence. If you can't get it, or if someone else can't get it, I won't accept any accusations from you or anyone else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"As for you said he called you Du Lin snorted. "He also said, it is only a contradiction. I have not yet reached the point where I need to kill him. This is someone who is planting a blame, you have to stand on my side."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s calm and logical conversation made Harry feel a little hesitant. Isn’t it really Du Lin’s? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what are the chips on the spot? Those chips are what you have in the city of Otis. Don't tell me, it doesn't matter to you!" Harry seems to have found the flaws of Doolin. In this empire, such a chip is only available in the city of Otis, and there is no semicolon in other places. Harry can understand the meaning of these chips, that is to tell everyone that this thing is his Du Lin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Harry’s opinion, Du Lin’s time is really too impulsive, even if there is any enmity that can’t be solved, it’s okay to start it, you have to make it. Look, the entire empire will shake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will reiterate my position and point of view. In the absence of any evidence, I will be considered awkward and filthy. You said the chips? The market in Otis is very good, especially in the first week of the first few days of the carnival, every day will be settled, except for some small denomination chips are taken away by tourists as souvenirs, more than 50 chips are not Less."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suggest you calm down, think about it, then I welcome you or anyone else to come to Otis to verify, I have other things , bye!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Doolin hung up the phone, he didn't take this matter to heart. From the moment they started making fake coins and being discovered by him, he had such a plan. He will definitely leave the city, and it is impossible to have too much future within the New Party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus regards him as a knife, and the knife is always the biggest threat to others when it is hidden in the scabbard, because no one knows When will you get rid of the knife because of something, and you will lose the last bit of courage in hesitation and hesitation. But if you bring the knife out when you come up, others will either run or die, and you will not achieve the best results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can a knife become a prime minister of a country? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has a speculation that he may stop the New Party’s top five and become a weapon hidden in the shadows, but he does not intend to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he has to use a big man’s death to tell everyone that Otis is his territory, without his permission, anyone’s offense , will be a fatal blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he also intends to use this opportunity to get rid of himself. The planning and development of the city of Otis has been bound by the rules and regulations. Even if the successor wants to chaos, it will not be able to move any bricks that make up the city in three to five years. If you continue to stay here, you may be able to spend your precious time in this dry consumption every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year he is twenty-one years old, and he is old... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His experience and experience have increased by one point, but the time available can be reduced by one point, he has no time to play count games here, he also There are many things to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this must be done by getting rid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has other reasons for doing this. The first reason is that the newspaper industry is now a mess. The mark that has just been released has completely collapsed. There are no good ways to clean up the bad industry rules. At this stage, the information is not smooth and Doolin's golden bullet offensive. The newspapers that people see will change their absolute neutral position and use the uncertain words to wash the land with Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This horrific attack is also limited to the place of Nano Lindes. People from other places can only see the peace and prosperity of the newspaper and the popularity of the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Du Lin, and all his men have evidence of absence, he bought a person on the railway, temporarily hired a front, in Without carrying a lot of heavy cargo, the speed of the steam locomotive reached a speed of nearly 80 kilometers per hour. It took only an hour or so to travel to and from Nano-Rendez. They all set off at four o'clock and returned to Otis at eight o'clock. And it was revealed in a lot of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having so much evidence of absence, as well as the heavy weapons and military-style equipment used in the attack, is enough to get some people’s attention away. Plus he has a federal plan in his hand, Magus must be sure to keep him, this matter is likely to be blamed for another group of people, and then finishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he is not worried at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Imperial Police Investigation Bureau headquarters building elevator can not reach the underground three floors, Amp was awakened, he sat up with his eyes open . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His room is not very big, only about twenty square feet, but the height is very high. From the ground to the roof is six meters high, which makes people living in such rooms have a very small illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the masked Anna in front of him and yawned and asked, "What? I just slept for a little while."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time they are tracing the case of an extreme reinstatement organization of a provincial sage, the other party intends to get some "big things" to let people know their existence. The above attached great importance to this matter and was directly pushed to Anna. Anna’s team was responsible for this case. Up to now, Amp only knows that there is something like "above", but who is above and what is the organization, he knows nothing about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna tells him that his level is too low, and maybe he will have a chance to know it later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, Amp read a lot of information about the "immortal flame" and correspondence, and finally summed up some clues. Now someone has chased these clues to investigate. It is. He finally took a break and was called again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
