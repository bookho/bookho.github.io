			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of evidence was denied, and several important witnesses stood up and confessed, so that a trial like a farce had no need to continue. At the moment when Kevin filed a counterclaim, the case ended here. After a 10-minute discussion with the jury, the final decision was submitted to the court. The judge sitting in the middle represented the other two and read the final result of the case. Du Lin was acquitted and could leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin packed up the documents and evidence on the table, and the court proceedings that the assistant helped him. These things need to be kept, this will be his worth. The sky that has skyrocketed again. In fact, whether it is a lawyer or a rich man, it is estimated that watching a few times will have something outside the case affecting the case, but they will not only say that Kevin is doing something wrong, but will praise Kelvin. Ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law firm and his partners need to make money. When they are interested in becoming a lawyer and start to study hard, they are conscience. Broken and thrown into the sewer, I can't find it anymore. As for the wealthy, they prefer Kevin. The rich who can find Kevin don’t care about money. They care if they spend money to get things done, can they turn their case into Doolin. In this case, the victory is won without any effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After watching Du Lin leave, Kevin put things in his briefcase and let his assistant go out to wait for him. He sat next to Amp. Amp slowly put a piece of evidence and a piece of material into the portfolio neatly. At this time there was no one in the court. Only a few reporters with disappointing colors were dismantling the camera equipment. Apart from them, there were few people here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin asked his assistant to wait outside, and Amp let his team members leave, waiting for the two people in the entire court, Kevin Ask him, "What are you going to do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp sits still, he hooks his finger at Kevin, the latter is a bit inexplicable, He only ordered a "cigarette." Amp smoking, Kevin also smokes, but Kevin sucks less. He couldn't find it in his pocket, and finally found two boxes of cigarettes for social preparation in his briefcase. He handed it to Amp, and he also ordered one. The two seemed to drag to the end to smoke a cigarette here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no more than a minute of silence. Kevin looked at the highest seat in the court and said softly: "Going out from the back door and going east has an alley. Going through to the right when you are on the boardwalk, there is a shop selling fish. You said that it was introduced by Mr. 350,000, he will send you to the Federation. When you settle down, give me a Letter, by the way, give me the account number, and every month there will be a sum of money on your account."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Kevin’s Ampang’s time was not light, of course, the main credit was Du Lin’s work. He just turned acquittal into innocence on Du Lin’s original plan, and then dropped Anpra . Although he did these things, he felt that Amp should not end his short journey like this. He is a very intelligent person, and it is a pity to waste it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that Kevin wants to turn Amp into his own, just to respect the enemy he has received. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp spit out the smoke, smiling and smiling as he looked at Kevin sitting next to him. "Do you want to buy me? Or say your conscience now." Found?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin hugged his hand on his chest, the other hand pressed on his arm, he bounced the ash, and the ash sent him to roll around When he shrugged his shoulders, he also licked his head. "Everything, just feel a little pity, because you lost in an unfair battle, it's just a pity."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp smirked, he took a deep breath and looked at the balance after the highest seat, as if asking himself, "You said, is this law really fair and just? From the day the law appeared, did you not miss it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is somewhat emotional, not quite like Amp, Kevin thought , replied: "When you believe that the law is fair and just, it is. But you forgot one thing, the law does not exist from the beginning. Rather, some people have compiled a 'convention' called law for some purposes. As for whether the law is fair and equitable, you should ask the aristocrats who codified the law, not me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The empire has no aristocrats!", Amp refuted a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin didn’t say anything about Amp’s naive point of view. In fact, everyone knows that as long as there is class, there is also a division of status. There will always be nobility in the world. They may have no longer called themselves aristocrats. They have changed the title very intelligently. Maybe they are now capitalists. Maybe they are celebrities, tycoons, and even politicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what they call, the nobility is there, just like the truth will never disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really think about my proposal?" Kevin looked at Amp very seriously and turned the topic back to the original thing. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp shook his head. "I believe that this world is justified and just!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin shook his head and stood up and glanced at him. "Hey, you don't say fairness and justice!" He sighed a little and extended his hand. "I am very glad to meet you, Mr. Amper. Maybe one day there will be a world you imagined, but that is definitely not now. If there is a chance, we will fight once again in such a world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp also reached out and held tightly with Kevin’s hand. Together, he smiled brilliantly, and he couldn't see any depression at all. He laughed with no heart. "If you have that day, you can't win me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The two ended the final conversation, one walking outside the court, one walking towards the back door of the court, and the two running in the opposite direction as if they were going to two worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A golden glow filled with light, the sun shines in front of Kevin, and he stepped into the light with a powerful step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small, dark, dark, dead door is covered with a thick shadow, not wearing shadows, and not seeing what is inside. The moment Amp walked in, it was like being swallowed up by the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the court, just saw Du Lin still standing on the steps. The victory of this trial meant that Du Lin had taken off Amp, and he also washed his own old bottom. Whether it's 30 million worth of bricks, or more than 70 million in cash lying in one of the federal accounts, it has been washed clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kevin walked to Doolin’s side, he shook his head slightly, and Du Lin was not disappointed, nor did he move. Anpu firmly chose the way he should go. Du Lin would respect him. He would not force Amp to do something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the reporter of the special publication was crowded up again. He pressed the person behind him and asked aloud: "Du Lin Sir, do you think there will be some off-site factors that interfere with the final outcome of this trial."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s eyes stayed on his face for a moment, Shake his head. "Your question is very strange. It seems that you have already confirmed that something is interfering with the justice of the judiciary. If there is, please tell me, please report these people, or things. If not, then you raise this question. The purpose is debatable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that it paused here. Many people did not hear anything wrong at first. They could be seen by Du Lin. They all looked at the reporter. The reporter was not afraid at all, still smiling. Du Lin smiled a few times and pointed to him. He actually answered this question. "Everyone is equal before the law. It is not only a person but also a thing. No matter what identity, status, and how much money I have, when I am When I was sitting in the dock, I was just a person, an empire citizen. You said that someone affected the trial? I don't think it is right, because this is the result I deserve, I am worthy of my heart!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a look at the shoulders of Buddha, and all of them immediately arranged the crowd and let Du Lin get on the bus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he got on the bus, Kevin had already sat in the car. The door and the glass blocked the reporters’ questions. When the Buddha was also seated, The car is slowly moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Check the guy and buy him a ticket to hell." Du Lin’s voice is full of killing, not that he can’t Tolerate others to look at him with a colored eye, nor is he unable to tolerate others to offend him, but all has a bottom line. There is no doubt that this reporter broke through the bottom line, so he has to pay for his actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technology of this world is far from the world in the dream of Doolin, the local information exchange called the earth is very developed, even if you don’t go out, just move Your fingers will be able to understand the size of the world. If there are any rumors or horrendous news, many people also know that they can search for it on their own and verify that they can tell the right or wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the world is not good, the channel for people in the world to get information is the newspaper, when a reporter from a special publication uses a different position, with deliberate writing After a press release, this press release was not published in a newspaper, but published in more than 90% of the entire empire, or even in all newspapers! If only one newspaper published his news, it might just be a "news", but when all the newspapers said there were stories behind the trial, people would believe that there was a story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the rich people do not like journalists because the position of the rich man is always in line with the position of the reporter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin rolled his eyes and made a sigh. "Hey, I said Du Lin, in front of a lawyer, do you discuss the murder with Dudu?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
