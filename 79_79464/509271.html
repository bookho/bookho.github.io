			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boss, someone reported that he had witnessed a murder on the street, what should he do now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando, who had just returned to the police station, had a foot outside the door. A young police officer came over and stood beside him, pointing to an old man sitting on a bench. Woman. Prando turned a blank eye. He made a slap and spit out a drink. "What should I do? Of course, I will investigate the case and find out the murderer. Do you still have to take it with you to know what to do?" Do you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just going inside, ready to go back to the lounge in the office and lie down for a while, the young policeman took a step Stopped him again. It took only half a second for his face to change from impatient to a little anger. There was a trace of anger in a pair of eyes, and the tone was very unfriendly. "I said damn, what else is there? Is it that the cows are lost? Or is the sewer blocked?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young policeman with a sly smile on his face whispered: "It’s Wood’s confidant, Mr. Jim."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly smoldering wine scatters from Prando’s body for a moment, he squats, grabs the collar of the young policeman, and slips him to his face, almost covering his face,” You mean Wood? Woodwood? Is his dog leg Jim?", seeing the young police officer nod his head, Prando pushed him away and strode to his office, "put things Tell me clearly, I remember you said that you are murdering in the street? Then there must be more than one eyewitness, and let me know things, you should come with me first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was about to enter the office, he knocked on the office desk, a 30-year-old face. The woman looked up at him, "Well let repair roll over immediately!" Finished speaking, Prang and more drawn into the office, the little police officers have followed suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the comfortable boss's chair, Prando tore the neckline that the neck and the neck fit very well. He pointed to the cup on the bar. I got the damn ice water, God, you learned to stand in the police school? Is it your eyes, there are many things in the world that you want to do!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young police officer lowered his head and walked over to the bar to make a glass of ice water for Mr. Prando, which was simply a cold water with ice. It is said that the small freezer for home has already been sold in the capital, but it is still too far away for Turner. All the ice in the city comes from the Tener ice-making factory. The ice cubes are divided into three grades, which are ice cubes made from boiled water, ice cubes made from tap water, and ice cubes made from well water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The materials used are different, and the price is of course different. Mr. Prando is of course the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a swig of the cup that had already been chilled, and the whole person felt a whole body. This is not good for fat people, even if it is autumn, you need to use ice water to cool down. He placed the cup on the coaster of the desk and looked at the young police officer and picked his finger. "You don't think you should say something now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The policeman was excited and immediately said, "Except for the old woman outside, she needs to take a break because she is scared. Now there are more than 20 people reporting the case. They all said that they witnessed a scene. Murder. There is only one deceased who can confirm his identity, Jim. He was murdered by a young man on the side of the street at the barbecue bar. The young man hooked his chin with a hook and then in his There were a few knives in the neck and chest, and died on the spot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to this, there is a murder case, the deceased is beyond recognition, we have not yet learned The identity of the deceased, but according to eyewitnesses, the deceased had gathered with a group of homeless people, possibly gangs..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, Prando only carried Looking up at the little police officer, "You just said "?", the little policeman's body was slightly stiff. When he was about to say something, Prando waved his hand and didn't let him say it. "Forget it, I know, you are doing very well, continue to investigate these. Things, now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando sighed after the little policeman turned away. He did not notice what the little police officer was saying. He knew that after the dead man was Jim, he immediately thought of the war between the gangs. Recently, he also learned that someone violated the rules of the three giants of the private car industry in the city of Tener, and privately sold the bar to the bar with high-level private wine that entered the market without their consent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the first day of knowing this, he has a hunch, and if the idiot continues to do things according to the rules, it is likely to attract The three giants joined forces to suppress. Sure enough, there are fewer than three people who Wood sent to inquire about the news for a few days. It must be the hands of those who are eager to move. In fact, at that time, Prando felt that things actually had room for change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as those people come up with a sum of money, then apologize and act according to the rules, there may not be any bigger conflicts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many days have you been in the past? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim is dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this not to say that these two groups are going to fight? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the head of the police station in the city of Ternell, Prando hates the most and the most feared, the war between the gangs. The wars of the little gangs are a little better, and they tend to end very quickly, with the restrictions on the number and size, and the war between the tycoons is the most terrible. They will launch more people, with greater scale, blatant mutual vendettas, and even massive killings! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing has not happened in the city of Tener. Every time a large-scale war breaks out, it means that the police chief will have a big trouble. . From the society, from the superiors, and from those taxpayers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is too much trouble, the Imperial Police Investigation Bureau will definitely ask this question. If it is not good, you may have to move your ass and go to the poorer mountains and rivers. Keep the fish pond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a big problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time the door was pushed open, and a guy who didn’t even wear the police uniform came in. He was Xiun. He is not a police officer and is affiliated with the Imperial Police Investigation Bureau. His full name is the Imperial Police Defence Investigation Bureau. If the local police station manages a regional security issue, then the Imperial Police Investigation Bureau manages the law and order of all parts of the entire empire, as well as major criminal cases. Their power is greater than that of the local police, and a number of agents are stationed in each city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schoen, is the investigator of the Investigation Bureau in the city of Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is said to have done something wrong because he was kicked to Tyne to support the old man. He is not very old, and his temper is a little cynical. There was no trouble with Prando after Nair City. In the eyes of Prando, this guy is like a gang who is far more like a detective in the investigation bureau. He is not fooling around on the roadside with some guys who are obviously not right people. They are born in bars every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time when Xiu En came to the city of Tener was less than two years, but the things about the local gang were more profound than the director of Prando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
