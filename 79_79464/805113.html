			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp always believes that there is no "perfect crime" in this world, and any criminal process will inevitably leave a little bit of a sin. The reason why many criminals go unpunished is not the incompetence of the law, but the case handlers cannot find these clues. Since graduating, Amp does not think that he will be an incompetent person, but this time he has to admit that the honor of the past is not because he is so great, but that he did not meet the real opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to Kevin’s lawyer who wants to be shameless, Amp has a second opponent, this guy called Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these accounts, most of the profits of the jewelry company were divided by the other three shareholders, and Du Lin only occupied a small part, but Amp I believe that the money in these accounts will eventually fall into Doolin's pocket, but I don't know how he did it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Du Lin also gave Amp a lesson, a valuable lesson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This half year, the Imperial Bank and the Police Investigation Bureau went crazy and searched for the gold in the entire empire. The 30 million gold is not a gold ring, just look for it. Every place can be sold. Even if so much gold flows into the underground money laundering channel, it will definitely reveal a golden flaw. But they almost rummaged through the entire empire and did not find the gold, so that the Imperial Bank and the Police Investigation Bureau thought that the gold was still hidden somewhere and did not let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can they think that this batch of gold has not only become money, but also is in the most prosperous street in the tourist area, the best city The mouth of the jewelry store is open to sell? No one can think of those dulins who used them to legally realize the legalization of gold for him. What makes Anp feel funny is that Du Lin has also paid a very high commercial tax, and then the Imperial Taxation Bureau and the Imperial Central Bank The money was stamped with a legal seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absurd is like a burlesque, the more funny is that even if I have guessed most of the things, I can’t say it because there is no evidence. . Du Lin may have figured this out. Once the gold in his hand is released, he will shape himself into a celebrity of the upper class. If there is no real evidence, he will trigger the roar of capital power, so what is Amp? I know, but I can't say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I take this information away? I will send the original back after I print it." Amp licked the hoe and pointed at the documents. The bank's employees had no reason to object. He took out a form to let Ann. The specific list and use of these documents were signed and they were signed before they were allowed to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the office, he turned the information over and over again and studied it several times. Each amount was marked with a different color pen, carefully Studying all the flow of funds, you can always find unreasonable places, and perhaps Doolin has other anonymous accounts. The most annoying thing for Amp is the imperial central bank. Anyone can go to them to register a bank account, without any documents for filing, even if it is a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has brought great difficulties to the investigation of many cases. The Cabinet Finance Minister also talked about several directors of the Imperial Bank’s board of directors. Unfortunately, everyone Not happy. Except for a few people who are asking the imperial central bank to file basic information, most people are opposed, especially those nobles and old party members. The only access credentials for an anonymous funds account are tokens or passwords, which is too convenient for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even inside the New Party, some people think that there is no need to make changes, and everyone has a "private money", so that everyone can be decent, decent retirement is not good ? Do you have to tear your face to be satisfied? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central bank of the empire is even less likely to agree, not that they are not willing to assist the ruling party in doing this work, but that they are kidnapped by those anonymous accounts. As you can imagine, once they announced that they would file basic information on all anonymous accounts, the funds in these anonymous funds accounts must be fleeing. This is not a multi-million-dollar problem, which may involve billions or even billions of big problems! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without these people and their unnamed money, it doesn’t take a week for the imperial central bank, the largest economy in the empire, to declare bankruptcy. The emergence of the crowded tide means that they don't have enough cash to pay for the fleeing funds. In a flash they are finished, and there is no chance to recover and regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp sighed and tidy up all the documents, just looking for the problem from the flow of funds that have been perfect, just picking up the files At the time, there was a piece of paper showing a corner, the name of a shareholder. When he reached out and pressed the document in, when his finger touched the paper, it was like a flash of lightning hitting his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately called the phone to the director of the Irian Police Department and informed him of his current position and name. He asked for information on the three Ilyan citizens. It takes time. After he hangs up the phone, he waits for this message in anxious, constantly turning his eyes to the phone, and even has auditory hallucinations several times. It wasn't until half an hour later that the phone bell really sounded, and he couldn't wait to get through the phone, and the heart thumped and slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amp leader, from the information you asked us to find, did not find the information of these three people, are you sure they are residents of Irian?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp has a smile on his face. "I am very sorry to bother your work. This may be a misunderstanding caused by staff mistakes on our side. I will investigate." After replying, please reply, thank you for your help, thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few words, Amp took the coat and went out to the office and went straight On the first floor, he got on the military vehicle. He gasped slightly. "Go to the Chamber of Commerce!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he is going to the Chamber of Commerce. If the other three shareholders of the jewelry company are not Ilyan, then there is a possibility that all three accounts are “pseudo-anonymous” accounts. Simply put, there are many channels for money laundering in the underground world of the Empire. . These channels have a large number of bank accounts that appear to be real names. They use these accounts to conduct money laundering activities while keeping some high-quality accounts in their hands, and then selling them at high prices to make a profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people who work in gray or illegal business need such an account, they will put their own money into these accounts that are not at all. If they have an accident, no one can find out what these "real existence" accounts have to do with them. This is their last protection for their wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that Du Lin’s three “partners” are most likely to be “buy”. If these people do not exist in reality, who registered the jewelry company? Registered companies and deposits in the Imperial Bank are not the same. A living person must bring his or her basic information to register with the company. If it proves that the other three people do not exist, it is enough to prove that Du Lin alone holds the jewelry company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time by investigating the registration information of the jewelry company to find the account that may have abnormal financial flows, it is enough to get the most critical evidence to nail Doolin On this case! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the prey can't escape the catch of a good hunter. Ampang took a sigh of relief and was also praying. He must get this key evidence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building of the Chamber of Commerce is also considered to be one of the landmark buildings in the Imperial Capital. Fang Fangzheng is a huge square building. It is said that this design is for people. Feel the sense of weight and the sense of oppression. Standing on the outside of the Chamber of Commerce and looking up, it can give people a feeling of being very small, and this is what the members of the Chamber of Commerce hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ordinary reported his position and name, asked to read the original file of Irian, the soldiers with guns guarded by Amp, this is better than any The instructions are more convincing. Immediately there was a senior management of the Chamber of Commerce, who took Amp to a room and waited for news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top management took Amp and sat for a while, and left after the things were delivered. He did not ask Amp these things and the 70 million big case. What is the relationship? It is already up to him that this class has understood that there are things that he cannot know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp quickly flipped through a page of documents, and the last punch was on the table, he found it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person named Tucks, this person is a native of Irian, his basic information is very complete, and this is the breakthrough point. But when Amp felt a burst of excitement, he quickly calmed down. If he had chased the trail behind Doolin and found that Du Lin had done all the evidence perfectly, then he would let go of this. Clue? Will he also handle this clue perfectly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very likely! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp’s original relaxed mind disappeared. He thought for a while and returned to the headquarters of the Imperial Bank to come up with the basics of this man called Tucks. Information, request for access. Soon Tucks' account information came out. There are two accounts under this person's name. Every month, there is a considerable amount of water flowing from his account. There are only a few hundred dollars on the account. Amp finally breathed a sigh of relief and continued to let the staff find out the account information of these watersheds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a hunch that he may have touched Du Lin’s tail! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely an amazing breakthrough. He waved his fist and the next amount of work was relatively large, and he realized that he didn’t eat at noon. The stomach has already begun to protest. After explaining it to the bank staff, he ran to the small shop on the side of the road to get some bread and patties, and a juice, gorging and licking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
