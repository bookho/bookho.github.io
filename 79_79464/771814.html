			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking a cigarette box, I couldn’t find a second cigarette. Mickey squeezed the cigarette box and threw it into the corner of the room, touching the pocket. The little change left was squeezed out of the narrow room and went straight to the door. His younger brother’s wife was holding a child and walking in the middle. Both of them stunned. The aisle is not wide and can only accommodate a little more than a person. This is a common problem for all the houses in the fifth district, because they need to use more space for their living instead of letting the children walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mickey’s wife holds the child’s back and clings to the aisle’s wall, giving up half the distance, Mickey walks over and walks sideways and walks outside. . Mickey's body is very strong, and it is inevitable that there will be some physical rubbing. In the process, Mickey smells a faint milky fragrance, which is the taste of the milk child. His heartbeat was a little accelerated. There weren't many clothes in the summer season. He just looked down on his subconscious mind and saw his brother's wife's chest tidal. There was a dark color in his face. Some of his nostalgia crowded over, and his heart was a little more irritated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mickey has three children, two boys and one girl. The girl has already married and become a burden for others, but the two boys are still at home. The parents live in the attic, the two brothers live in two rooms on the second floor, the first floor is the kitchen and dining room, and the utility room. The house is small and crowded, especially after the younger brother is married and destined to the space of the future house is definitely not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mickey has been working at the dock before. It is not an easy task to find a woman to marry. On the contrary, his brother is still in school, but he has already Married, and there is a child. For this reason, Mickey’s parents almost spent the savings at home, but he also had no complaints. After all, it was his younger brother. It's just that sometimes life is not very convenient, especially at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mickey, who didn’t leave home, swears, as long as he spends tomorrow, he will change to a big house, then pick one of a group of women and he likes it. Become his wife. He wants to have three...no, four children, and will build a garden so that they can play freely, and each of them has to arrange a separate room, large room. He needs to build a swimming pool and don't have to cross three areas in the summer to enjoy the water on the crowded beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to buy a car for every child, let them have the best education, the best clothing, let them have the best of everything! He will also let them go to school, even if they spend money to go to school, they will go to school, then they will have a decent job after graduation, and then become a middle class. Perhaps one or two of these children are very smart and have the talents of those capitalists. He can take some money to let them invest or do business. Maybe there will be more rich people in this family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, he would accompany his wife every day, or go out for sports with friends, find a bar to drink and drink at night, and occasionally open the plaque. Such a day will be very long, but he does not think it is boring because he lives in happiness every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of Mickey’s sigh of relief, as long as things are done tomorrow, such days are no longer a fantasy. He has a plan, he intends to swallow all the money, money, this thing will never be suspected of it, obviously can have millions of people alone, why should we share the money with those mediocre people? He hid this plan in his heart, and according to the plan they would eventually go out to sea and then landed at another location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is plenty of time and opportunity in the sea for him to put his plans into action, taking such a big risk, always having a little bit of gain . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking a pocket, I remembered that the last cigarette had been exhausted. He saw a dimly lit street with a searchlight in the distance. It is the store. The shops in the fifth district basically have no decent facades, not modified by scrapped trucks, or such shops that operate in the home. There aren't any expensive things in the store, most of them are between dozens of dollars and a dollar, and no more than two dollars, because the backlog of goods will take up too much money from the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy a box of fifteen-point cigarettes, through the cigarette box, you can smell the inferior tobacco inside, he pulled out one, The streetlights ignite, and the moment of the fire illuminates the surrounding environment. He rubbed his hand, because at that moment, the corner of his eyes saw that there was a person standing under the tree on the side of the road? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big night stood in such a dark place, how do you think it feels scary. Although Mickey did not believe that there was a set of gods and ghosts in the world, he chose to go forward without going down, and his footsteps accelerated. No matter how fast his steps are, he always feels that there is someone behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After passing three consecutive broken street lights, he stood under the fourth bright streetlight and turned around indifferently, he wanted to see Who is joking with him? He saw the guy, and he was a little embarrassed. A child who looked like a 13-year-old was carrying a bag and was standing at the junction of light and darkness. The child looked at Mickey with horror, and the muscles on Mickey's face were all distorted, and the sly expression was distorted by the acidity of the cockroach. He wiped the sweat from his face and threw three very few coins out of his pocket and threw it on the ground. "Take money from another road. If I find you follow me, don't blame me!" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the child's awkward bend, Mickey turned and planned to move on. Just the moment after he turned, his pupil suddenly shrank to the extreme, a guy with a domed hat and a windbreaker in the midsummer stood in front of him. The next second, a sharp thing pierced his chest from his chest, and a feeling of dampness immediately spread to the point where it was stabbed, spreading continuously around. The strength in his body also slid away from Mickey's body quickly along the wound. The man stepped forward to support Mickey and said softly in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Doolin asked me to say hello to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mickey tried his best to get the man Pushing away and swaying, I want to escape from here. Just as he is about to hit the boy, the boy also took out a knife and put it forward and inserted it into his abdomen. His whole body is like a cooked sea shrimp, curling his body, licking his waist and licking his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked incredulously at the face of the regular teenager, a long, long knife that pulled away from his body and calmly escaped him. The direction of the fall. The ticking drip sound was magnified countless times, and it was black in front of him. He turned to the ground and turned to the ground. He watched the boy take two small glass bottles from his bag and threw it on the ground in his gaze and broke the ground. A strange smell that couldn't be said began to drill into his nostrils, and the power seemed to return to his body with this smell, and even the wounds were not so painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two quickly left, and Mickey, who gradually recovered his "power", wanted to get up, but he tried many times without success, and he shouted loudly. Helping lives, alarmed the neighbors. Soon the ambulance arrived and sent him to the hospital. His injury looked very heavy. In fact, he did not hurt the key. After a simple dressing and blood transfusion, he was discharged from the hospital that night. The next morning, the demonstrations began as expected. Mickey led everyone to hold the sign in an orderly manner, shouting the slogan of the slogan from the fifth district all the way to the door of the 350,000-person house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to calm the storm, Mr. 350,000 invited them to enter the manor. There weren't many bodyguards in the manor, and Mickey, who was discussing with him about how to solve this problem, suddenly pulled out two bodyguards behind him and killed the rich man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tyrannical rich man did not hesitate to take 10 million of cash from the bank and hand it over to him. Escape from the ship of Irian. On the boat, in the eyes of his companions, Mickey shot and killed all his companions, and pointed his gun at the 350,000 Mr. Three hundred and fifty thousand people crying and crying for him, telling himself how much Poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
