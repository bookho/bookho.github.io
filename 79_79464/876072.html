			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucho’s president of the Workers’ Union before he came to Otis to communicate with him alone to quell his grievances from the prosperous area to the backward areas . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the president of the city told Bucho, the development of the city of Otis was very fast, according to the "Otis City Development Plan" given by Mayor Du Lin. The convenient transportation mentioned, in a few years, the city of Otis will become a big city beyond the nano Lindes. At that time, the business of Nano Lindes may face a full-scale contraction, and the migrant workers will migrate to the city of Otis. Therefore, before the development of the city of Otis, the banner of the workers’ union must be firmly inserted. at this place. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers’ union seems to be just an organization that cares for the working class. In fact, when it comes to the essence, workers’ unions can also be regarded as a service-oriented company. In addition to collecting the contributions paid by workers each year, the workers’ union also accepts unpaid amounts including but not limited to donations, and they also have a unique business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to work with the workers to make money in a way that is often overlooked - agency fees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers will tell the workers’ unions about the gaps in their workers’ wages and pay a certain fee, and then the workers’ union will publish the nature and salary of these positions in the workers’ union. On the advertising blackboard, as long as a worker successfully recruits this position, the workers' union will charge a certain introduction fee from the worker. This introduction fee is very small, probably only between 20 and 30. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many workers are there in the entire empire, and how many migrant workers are there? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding a medical examination and a messy fee is definitely a non-negligible income, but because the income is diluted to everyone, it’s almost pitiful. So everyone doesn't think it's making money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vibrant future of Otis is destined to have a wide range of employment needs in the city, as well as the workers’ union’s filling of social responsibility, highlighting the union The importance of politics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucho took over the job and did not see the job as a difficult job. In his opinion, it was just to build a club and follow the daily routine. The way of working is going on. When necessary, stand up and represent the interests of the working class to compete for capitalism or the authorities. Just what he did not expect is that there is a different mayor here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many cities, those in power and capitalists are full of disgust and hatred towards the workers' unions, at least they will not show them, because they represent a huge number of classes and control the killings of the workers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day when Du Lin came back, Bucho went to the door. He sat facelessly opposite Du Lin. "Mr. Mayor, you know before." In a few days, a worker fell from the scaffolding because of the safety protection, and it caused a serious injury?” Du Lin nodded. Bujo continued: “I just returned from Nano Lindes, the worker. The situation is very bad. There is a business report here..." He put the report from the doctor on the table and pushed it over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The injured person has not yet recovered, the doctor thinks that he may have injured the brain, so further observation and treatment are needed, and the doctor also put forward a point of view. I think that not getting medical care in time is one of the main reasons why the injured can't wake up. After all, it is more than three hours away from Nano Lindes, and the injury is constantly worsening during this time!", Bucho Sighing, there was some sad expression on his face. "The city hall of Otis has the next and disadvantages in the infrastructure. The hospitals in this city actually have no doctors. There are only two older nurses. I think In this case, the City Hall also has some responsibilities. I hope that the City Hall and you can pay for the injured person to pay a certain amount of medical expenses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked at Doolin, and Du Lin looked at him. After a moment, Du Lin asked: "Is it finished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucho is a bit puzzling, but his Feeling very bad, as if I said so much Meaningless, but he is now faced with this young man, no matter how young he was, he is the mayor, we must give him some respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching Bujo nod, Du Lin took the business report on the table and looked at it. Well, I can understand it. This is more exciting. Comfortable. After looking through a few pages, he threw the business report back onto the table. "I need to correct you some mistakes, Mr. Bucho."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, as far as I know, the worker violated the "Safety Rules for Construction" jointly formulated by the Workers' Union and the Chamber of Commerce, and it is a violation of the rules. The consequences of illegal operations should not be violated. Anyone will take responsibility." Du Lin made a phone call to Kevin at night to ask about related matters. Now he has a good idea. "Second, according to the imperial law, anyone is injured in public, especially It is a serious injury. I should contact the city’s hospital and police station for the first time. I have not seen any records about your police report from these two sides. You have transferred the injured without the consent of the police station and the city hospital. To the farther nano Lindes, you should be responsible for this, not the city hall of the city of Otis and the hospital."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirdly, the nature of workers' unions is a social organization of a nature of service. You can't represent the law, nor can you represent an official attitude. Before I and the more advanced judicial department of the empire did not give you authorization, you are not qualified to ask anyone for financial advice. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Based on the above three points, Mr. Bucho, you think you came to me to sit down today, and then give me a injury that I don't care about. The report asks me to ask for money, is it appropriate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s counterattack sharpened to the extent that Bucho was unpredictable. He stared at Du Lin and did not say for a long time. Speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that he doesn’t want to say it, but he doesn’t know how to refute Du Lin’s point of view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More often than not, everyone is obeying a customary rule that gradually forms part of universal values. It cannot be said that these rules are wrong, but More detailed and written rules that are clear and legally valid, these rules do not have any competitiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When others humiliate you, you can choose revenge by force. From the public's emotional point of view, this is fine, but the law does not allow it, which makes selection a problem. . Counterattacks and revenge are the right thing to do if the authorities don't mind, but when the official begins to strictly enforce written rules, this is a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucho did not expect Du Lin to be so familiar with these things, he was a bit embarrassed at the time, his disposal methods were considered, and reference to other The decision made by the club and the experience of the work you have worked for. The medical situation in Otis is very clear to everyone. There is no doctor at all. What is the significance of applying for medical treatment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alarm is even more meaningless, what the police can do, this is not a criminal case. In addition to doing a transcript, they have no choice. In order to consider the safety of the injured, Bucho decided to send the workers directly to Nal Lindes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s exactly what he seems to be the most correct decision, but instead he is passive, he ignores the fact that the mayor of Otis seems to Do not eat the workers' union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the humanitarian, I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bujuo had not finished, Du Lin waved his hand and prevented him from continuing. "If humanitarianism is useful, there will be no Civil War, no criminals and victims. I respect the humanitarian spirit, but This is a legal country, Mr. Bucho. We should consider whether we should comply with humanitarianism on the premise of obeying the law.” Du Lin took out a cigarette case and ordered a cigarette and shrugged his shoulders. “In humanitarian Under the call, I am willing to make a personal donation..." He snorted in his pocket and took out a fifty-dollar coin and placed it on the table. "Double donation helps the worker."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I remember that after the union paid a certain fee, should the workers’ union pay for the medical expenses for the workers?", said Du Lin laughed happily. He played the dust that did not exist on the neckline. "I used to be a member of the trade union!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucho’s face is very unsightly The fifty-dollar coin with a metallic luster on the table, the coin The Star Yao emperor empire XVI smile is like laughing at him. He stood up in anger and picked up the business report on the table and said a word of deed. He turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also shouted in the back, "Mr. Bucho, you forgot my donation, do you think that 50 is not money?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucho’s footsteps stopped and he turned and walked coldly to the table, trying to pick up the coin, didn’t expect The small coin he buckled twice did not buckle up, the action was a little rough, sliding the coin into the hand along the table, turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head and he knew that it would never end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucho returned to the temporary office of the Workers’ Union after leaving, and his face was black and he could drop water. Someone wanted to say something to him, he took The hand of the business report was lifted and the person was opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more he wants to go back to his office, the more he does not want to be reconciled, he can’t admit defeat, if the workers’ union can’t reflect the decisiveness from these powers and capitalists. With different momentum, the workers' union will become a display. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a while and called the lawyer in. "Dulin is very uncooperative. Do we have a way to sue him and win?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
