			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, what business do you need to do?", the girl still smiles, has no impatient expression, and is not sitting opposite her. A little eleven or three-year-old guys will look down on his mentality. As a leader in the performance of the receptionist of the Imperial Bank of the City of Tener, she has heard many rumors, one of which is about a child's business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the story is probably that a branch received a child of only ten years old, and the receptionist appeared to be impatient, and the tone and attitude were naturally biased. . But no one thought that this child was actually the son of the branch president. Eventually this incident was reflected to the governor, and the natural thunder was furious. The entire branch was "blood washed" from top to bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rumor is almost the vast majority of banking practitioners, especially the employees of the Imperial Central Bank, who have heard of the nose and eyes, as if it really happened Too much... Yes, just as “images” really happened, this is a fake rumor, the purpose is to improve the service attitude of bank staff. The capitalists exploited their own employees and almost tried every means. Even the fabrication of rumors and the recognition of semi-official attitudes can happen. What else can't happen? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savi heard the girl’s voice, but his eyes were tightly locked on the wall clock on the bank wall, and the time passed by. He was waiting, waiting for Doolin to tell him what plan he needed to execute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan to rob the bank vault looks complicated, but in fact it is a few words. Since he discovered that he wanted to storm the treasury that was impossible to succeed, he changed the tough way into a way of using wisdom. He wanted to steal a million deposit from the bank vault, if there were other things. He does not mind taking it with him. The key to the implementation of the plan is the Schubert escort, who wants to impersonate the escort team from Orodo, and gives the items that exceed the list as a necessary condition for entering the vault, and the manager actively helps them open the elevator and let them Enter the inside of the vault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plan is very bold, and Du Lin believes that there is a high success rate. The reason is very simple. First, because the Imperial Central Bank of the City of Tener has not been robbed by any forces after the war, even the escort has not been looted, which will cause all the staff inside the bank to breed a kind of Arrogant mentality. Although in some respects this arrogance is also true, no one in the city of Tener and Cannes dared to shoot against the Imperial Central Bank, they could not afford revenge from the largest economy of the Empire. Under such arrogant emotional disturbances, many key places will be slack and sloppy. For example, the escort cars that should have been escorted in strict accordance with the regulations will be robbed by Doolin because of their arrogance and arrogance. Then the bank staff will naturally have such arrogance. They think that it is impossible for someone to dare to pay their attention, which leaves a lot of possibilities for Du Lin’s plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the communication of information is not smooth. It is said that the telephone and telegraph services have started in the core of the Empire. However, there is no civilian telegraph in the town of Tener, which gives Duolin a fake Ordo Bank. The staff has enough time difference. The use of information asymmetry can completely convince these people that Du Lin is the staff of Orodor. Coupled with the cooperation of Schubert and the numbness of arrogance, there is absolutely no problem if you want to succeed in looting without accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is actually a third point. This group of workers who have long been accustomed to strictly implementing the standards set by the bank’s headquarters as work habits have long forgotten how to work around. Dealing with emergencies, once they change, the first thing they think of is not how to deal with things well, but to think about the situation in the face of sudden situations. Which one is applicable to the rules and regulations is the most appropriate. The rigid and rigid work style made Du Lin make up the last short board, which prompted him to venture into the underground vault with Dudu and others, and to make a fortune for the one million yuan deposit and possibly more valuables. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few seconds of Savi, the elevator also slowly landed. After a brief tremor, the elevator door opened. Du Lin looked at the sorting table and concealed the shock in his heart. All of them just took a look and recovered their gaze. They didn't seem to care about them, but no one could understand the shock of their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a huge assembly line connecting twenty-four pipes, glass pipes, every coin falling from the pipe, the coins will One screen falls down, and then on a slope, according to the size of the volume, it enters the sorting channel during the sliding process, and finally accumulates in a smaller glass tube. Whenever 50 pieces are accumulated, the handle under the tube will sink slowly because the weight cannot be eaten. Then the 50 coins put in this yard will be placed in a groove, and the staff will roll a layer of kraft paper. Set aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorting of banknotes is relatively difficult. It is manually sorted. There are a total of four sorted staff. They wear one-piece clothes and there is no clothes on them. Pockets or places where things can be loaded, in order to prevent some people from arbitrarily collecting coins in order to satisfy greed. They divide the coins into six categories and sort them into different conveyor belts according to different types. The worker in the middle of the conveyor belt will place the stacked and stacked flats on the conveyor. Behind not far away, there is something like a boiler. The length is about two meters. Every two meters of the conveyor belt will fall on the conveyor belt, and then there will be a burst of hot steam. When the conveyor belt is working again, the coins that might have been wrinkled have been cleaned by steam and ironed, and the final neat code through a funnel-shaped restraint is placed in a box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a counting machine under the box. When each one is out of 100, it will be automatically wrapped into a stack, and then sorted into a larger box, where someone will put the coins in neat. The money will eventually be sent to the vault for accumulation. By the end of the month, if the bank stores more than one million in cash, the excess will be sent to the branch of Ordoto in the box, and then transported to the gold stock in the southwestern part of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that there’s so many coins in the small town of Turner, it’s rumored that the big cities and even the sorting houses of the capital are What a horrible picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s heart has an impulsive temptation. If the act of robbing the Central Bank of the Tener Empire is only a trade-off, then at this moment, he has a kind of The desire of the capital empire central bank treasury to walk a circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can face the mountains of money and be indifferent, that is, God can't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He converges and continues to follow the manager’s back to the vault, saying that it is a vault, in fact, it is a huge cage, and the neatly stacked cash is lit up in a few searchlights. Under the light of daylight, it exudes a charming luster. What surprised Du Lin was that he also saw the gold bricks, his thick calves, and the one-foot-long bricks, a total of ten, piled up into a triangle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Doolin did not know that these bricks were shipped during his imprisonment. The Great Patriotic War defeated the federal people. Although it was not a complete victory, it finally solved the external problem. The external troubles have been solved, but internal worries are still problems. Some resurgent revolutionary forces have begun to appear in people’s sights and actively carry out activities. They did not attempt to incite the country in a destructive manner as before. They drew on the experience of the last failure and adopted a more civilized approach to form a party and actively carry out political campaigns with the party as the core. This makes the upper levels of the Empire feel more worried than the simple destruction, especially the old party’s hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revolutionary army really hurts those nobles. If the new party is a successful "revolutionary army," they overthrew the rule of the old party and the emperor and held the present The regime of the empire, then these revolutionary forces are the representatives of failure. They also want to overthrow the rule of the nobility and the emperor, but they chose the wrong means and the result was relentlessly suppressed. In the face of the revolutionary army's renewed enthusiasm, the top of the empire holds two attitudes. The first is the attitude of the old party, which suppresses the revolutionary army at all costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
