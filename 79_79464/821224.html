			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp just came out of the back door of the court and realized that he had put Kevin’s cigarette in his pocket. He wanted to change the cigarette back in his footsteps. He has no habit of owing people things. The next moment he realized that Kevin had left. Suddenly there was a feeling that he couldn’t say it, just like... he is like Juan. He glanced at the majestic courthouse and walked silently into the alley behind him, climbing from the ramp to the top of the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the building is very windy, and the waves that turn into snowflakes are a little awkward. He sits on the edge of the roof and takes out the cigarettes. Then click on one. Soon, the cigarette was exhausted, and he dropped it on the ground, then glanced at the empty cigarette box and pulled out the tin foil inside. Tin foil is not completely made of tin. It can be said that tin is printed on white paper. This is done to save Chen Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the tin foil and spread it on his hand, his fingers writing on the tin foil, as if he were actually recording something. Then he picked up the lighter, found a place to leeward, and lit a fire at the cigarette case. He never understood why Juan had to burn the cigarette case at the last minute because there was no smoke? It shouldn't be. He hasn't been very comfortable with his two consecutive cigarettes. He doesn't believe that Juan, who smokes so much in one breath, wants to continue smoking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he suddenly realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the high temperature roasting, the sealing wax outside the cigarette case begins to melt, and a drop of water drops like a drop of water, and finally a piece of film is formed on the ground. Blasted wax! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if there is no Kevin this time, he can't pull Du Lin down because he has a killer - Juan's suicide note, hidden in Juan In the belly. Who can think that someone will write a suicide note without staying around, but swallow it in the stomach, no doubt these are all arranged by Doolin. The note that wrote the words "family" and "you" should be seen by Du Lin for Juan. Then he wrote his plan on tin foil, put it in a cigarette case, and then put the cigarette case. I gave it to Juan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t say a tendency to say from beginning to end, so there is no such thing as a “person’s card” in this case, and then he calmly Killed Juan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Juan can be said to be suicidal, after all, there is a suicide note. But it can also be said that he was murdered by Doolin because he had to die, he was not dead, his family would be unlucky, he must die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have figured it all out, and I still have a lot of depressed feelings. This game is not lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a next time, if there are not so many other factors to interfere with him, let him have the power to investigate the case according to his own ideas... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Amp went down from the port of Emperor, he found his past colleagues, and his colleague took out an arrest warrant and gave it to Ann. Pu, a face-to-face look, "Don't make it difficult for us to do it, match it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp just saw a few of the most important places to be true The arrest warrant gave up the resistance. The two put him in the car, he did not ask questions, and did not ask for anything. He knows that he is in trouble this time. If he does not, he will not only lose the position of the prosecutor, but he will also go to jail. He used to offend a lot of rich people and powerful people. This time he fell down. They may not just clap their hands and throw stones, but also throw stones into the water? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp was suspected of falsifying evidence and tortured the news. After the newspaper, the emperor immediately opened a press conference, claiming that the mastermind of the fraud has arrived. In the case, an accomplice was also arrested, and then they compiled a story according to the facts, a story that everyone recognized, and ended the case. As the first defendant, Hoodock may... No, he will definitely be hanged unless he tells where the money is going and gets the money back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Mr. Luke, he has no strong backing, and with the economic recovery of the empire, some places have already had the omen of great construction, and his mines in the west are The man is eyeing. The man just made a phone call, and the investigation team, who had no intention of releasing Luke in the face of suspicion, gave up the idea. Not only do they have to take Hodock's affairs, but they also have to take Luke's things into reality, so Luke also has his own "script." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, there are two things that happen to be related to Amp. The first thing is about the trouble of "torture". The four officers who are responsible for the custody and interrogation of the three witnesses are now asking them to come back to the pot. Whether they say that they have done it or not, this is the case. four people. No one stood up and voluntarily admitted that it was the four of you who worked together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes things are so simple and rude, so the four days of disaster-stricken agents in order to minimize their guilt, they first admitted to participating Torture, but unified the caliber. That is, the torture was not their idea, but was authorized by Amp. Amp asked them to "do everything possible" to get the confession, so they took measures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall was pushed down by everyone, and the prison was inexplicably flawed and bitten on Amp. First, Amp is qualified to do this. Secondly, his status is enough for the above to accept. So, under the impetus of these two things, plus Kevin counterclaims that he has created perjury, tortured confessions, blasphemy, framed crimes, etc. And he let the deputy minister lose face, he was arrested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Capital intends to deal with this matter coldly. After all, Amp is the newcomer they launched last year, and it has also given a high evaluation. It is like a savior. As a result, so much sewage has now poured into Amp's body, and the faces of several big figures in the judicial profession have been swollen. In the absence of Amp, they actually ended their evidence collection and trial work. Finally, they removed the public duties of the Amp prosecutor and sentenced them to three years in prison. They were not allowed to be released on bail and could not be commuted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being detained for two days, Amp knew this, and he looked helpless and remembered what Kevin said to him. And extended new ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the person making the law cannot achieve fairness and justice in itself, what can be said that the law he has enacted can be called fair and just? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not even return home, was directly sent to the Imperial Second Prison. On his charge, he should be held in a regional prison, not the place where the heavy prisoners are held in the Imperial Second Prison. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Amp was replaced by a prison uniform and holding his "home" into the prison, he immediately noticed that several shares were full of hatred. His eyes were firmly locked on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed and accepted his life and went to his own prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that his next days will not be so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day before Amp’s arrest, there was a big news, and a reporter from a special publication had more drinks. I accidentally fell off the passenger liner, and when the rescue team found him, only half of the body remained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is so strange, some people are waiting in the prison for the coming of light and justice, some people holding the darkness in the compliments of people to go to glory, some people think they take When it comes to the truth, it is not known that the truth is often stinging. Perhaps only true honest people can enjoy a dull life, such as Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially after Savi told him to get the reporter, Du Lin was more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His reputation has once again risen a lot. Sometimes people are not afraid of you, but you can’t do it, but there is no rumor outside you. When people say that 70 million are in the hands of Doolin, when people say that Juan was killed by Doolin, he still walks in the sun, and people must pay tribute to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person is idle, sometimes it will be a lot of things, and Kevin has not sent a week to come, and a letter from Tener is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is here?", Du Lin, who got the letter, turned over and looked at it. There was no information from the sender, only his information. He opened the envelope with two separate letters. He first read the first one. The first line let him know who sent the letter. Look at the other one, if you haven't seen it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to write this tone and use it for him, there is only one in his memory, deep memory, he is old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up another one and looked at it. A letter was smeared everywhere. After reading it, he calmly opened a letter from Mr. After reading it carefully, I suddenly felt that my father was a fool. He did not intend to take care of this matter. Mr. Knox is now safe enough. He really does not want to have any relationship with the "uncle" called Mennon. Mr. Kesma told Du Lin that he needed to solve it himself, or he would look down on him as a bastard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already a jerk, can you afford it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a happy rich person is not happier than those troubles? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin re-stacked the letter, put it in the envelope, and then found Dev in front of him, "sticking with glue, like no opening Disassemble the same, then call the post office, let them build a mailbox under the cliff over there, and then stuff the letter into it. Do you understand what I said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deve nodded. "We haven't received any letters!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin suddenly smiles and slaps, "Yes, you said That’s right, this month it’s starting to rise by twenty dollars!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
