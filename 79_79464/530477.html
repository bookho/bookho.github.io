			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body that has lost its life has begun to stiffen, and a black blood mark has been hanged from the seams that have been stitched together. They may be at the moment of death. I can't believe that I want to leave the world. No matter how the world hurts them, there is always something worthy of their love. However, they left, because Graf broke the plan, because they did not kill Wood in the first place, so they died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst guy is the boy who grabbed Robben from behind and licked him. Du Lin vaguely remembered what he seemed to be, right The temple was smashed, and the bones around it were broken and trapped. That was the result of a wrench that had broken out of life. In fact, he didn't need to use death in exchange for such terrible results, as long as Graf was there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All assumptions are based on the perfect implementation of the plan, there may always be some people, or something will continue to undermine the plans that have been drafted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glaf slammed his head on the floor, and he said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, his mother and brother were rescued, just as Doolin told him, when they started to work with Wood, Wood wouldn’t Hurt his mother and brother. The lion may eat in a way that shocks the hyena trying to provoke it, but if the hyena does a provocative move before the lion eats, no matter how hungry the lion is, it will kill those who dare to be on it. After you walk the dog towards it, you will enjoy the food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This order will not be easily reversed. The younger and stronger the lion, the more he cares about maintaining his majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save two people, die six, the most critical guy is still running, this is the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the face of Doolin’s accusation, Graf had no other way than to hold his head and suffer. He is wrong, that is, he is wrong, he will not use any excuses to elute his own mistakes, which is why everyone is willing to trust Graf - he is a trustworthy guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most cases, this is indeed the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the room was very dignified, and Du Lin’s eyes were low and his eyes were stabbed in Graf’s body like a sword from a half-skinned eye. For a long time, he sighed and walked back to his desk and sat in the chair. He tilted his legs and hugged his hands on his knees. Although it was a very common movement, it gave people a very unique feeling. It’s like... he can decide everything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That way, you personally apologize to the family of each victim, send a pension, care for their emotions, and fight for their forgiveness. Everyone is willing to forgive you, I will forgive you, but this does not mean more. If someone does not want to forgive you, I hope that you can live a calm and prosperous life, this is your first dream. I will not move Your right to dividends, you will still have full cash every month to enter your account at the Imperial Central Bank, enough for you to enjoy the peace of life you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Du Lin shook his head gently. "You and me are different from us. Graf, you can't do something, don't force yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Graf, who was holding his head on the ground, let go of his hands, his blushing eyes staring at Doolin, giving Doolin a feeling that he could not wait to swallow himself. In the face of Graf's gaze, Doolin did not retreat in the slightest, his eyes did not even show the slightest fluctuations, as calmly facing Graf's gaze as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to kick me out!", Graf slowly stood up and had to say that physically strong people stood in front of people who were younger than themselves. It does have a great sense of oppression. But unfortunately, Du Lin never felt that he was weaker than Graf. Maybe his man is not very tall, but his heart is very high, very big, very strong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders and nodded unexpectedly. "This is not my problem, my brother, this is your problem, understand?" "" Du Lin raised a hand and slammed the table with a finger, and said in a word: "This is your problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The muscles on Graf’s face jumped. “What problem do I have?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Alcohol!”, Doolin stretched out a finger and then tightened Then I extended a second finger. "The night doesn't go home. I know where you are going. You put your energy on those cheap women, and don't even come back at night.", in Graff's gaze Du Lin stretched his third finger. "You are too enthusiastic about everyone, but you have forgotten what we do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, there is the fourth point, you have no obedience. Destroy our plan and exchange six lives for your two very safe relatives. If I didn't guess wrong, Graf, guard you. There should be no more than three mothers and your brothers. They may not have a knife on them. Is it right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin斩The bold speculation made Graf stiff all over, and Du Lin did not guess, his mother and his brother were held by Wood in a villa in the suburbs. In addition to a few days of not eating enough, hungry dizziness, Wood did not treat them cruelly. Because at that time, Wood was still a gentleman! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentleman! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Graf easily saved his mother and brother, and almost did not encounter any trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he was very emotional, because he arbitrarily thought that he was not the key and left the plan, causing six teenagers to die. In fact, Graf’s heart is not full of flaws. He has never hated himself as he is now. Then Du Lin planned to kick him out, which made him a little embarrassed and awkward. The fellow country association can be said that he personally established it and then let Du Lin become the president. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost everyone in the association’s meeting, he personally contacted, six bodies made him more painful than Doolin, because these people are At his request, he joined the fellowship. But now, Du Lin told him that he should go to enjoy the life of affluence and happiness, and leave everything here, and the reason is that he made the mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hates himself and hates Du Lin’s ruthlessness. It’s just a matter of words. Why do you want to make it like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gasped, and Du Lin, who was sitting across from him, could even feel the airflow from his nostrils flowing in the room, he squatting at Doolin Shake his head. "No, I won't leave. The fellowship will not only belong to you, but also belong to me! I will definitely never leave!" He almost snarled a few steps to the table, two huge fists 狠He was on the table, leaning forward as much as possible, his face and Du Lin's face were less than 20 cm away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this twenty centimeters, for Graf, may be a distance that can never be surpassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
