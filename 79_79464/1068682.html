			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you going to be faster?", the Buddha who is driving the car, glanced at Du Lin, who was closed in the rearview mirror, and stepped on the power pedal. The speed of the car is constantly increasing, and more than one car after another in the traffic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin opened his eyes and looked at the scenery outside the window, shook his head. "They didn't invite me. I took the initiative to go to the door and it would seem that I lacked confidence. Since they To avoid me, then I will avoid them. This game is still going on. Who is the last winner is not sure!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the car, Du Lin knew that the group had joined together and only excluded themselves. He was not in the West for some time ago. On the other hand, the most important contract in his hands is also an important factor. Any industry self-regulatory organization is never the one who has the most money and who speaks the most. It depends on who has more resources. Now Du Lin’s resources are the most important. Once they invite Du Lin, Will lose the initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is the shareholder of the Southern Commercial Bank, Berito, one is the imperial central bank, and is temporarily replaced, these two have always been strong in the capital market Now, let them sit behind Doolin when they are sitting, they may not be used to this kind of sitting. So simply kick Du Lin out of the game, and then set a threshold to prevent him from coming in. The things in his hands are naturally useless, and finally they should be treated cheaply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of fighting with Du Lin, it is better to let him lose directly. Their ideas are good, but they are not necessarily successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you have to do now is not to go to the door, it makes no sense, except for people who are jokes, others will think that this is Du Lin’s which performed. He panicked, he was scared, so he wanted to be tough and then tough to get a chance to compromise. So Du Lin will not give these people the opportunity to see what they think is self-righteous. Compared with the current toughness, he hopes to watch this group of people set up the stage, put on the opera clothes and make up the makeup. When the performance was told that their performance was illegal, Du Lin would like to see the watch on their face at that moment, will it be as wonderful as I imagined! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the villa, Du Lin took a shower and changed clothes. The dry climate in the west made him feel that there was a grain in the nose and trachea when breathing. It feels that in this respect the west is far less pleasant than the east coast. The more humid air humidity is actually very good for people's lives. At least people will not damage the respiratory mucosa to infect various diseases because of the dry air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, what makes Dulin even more satisfied is that Kinsale did not follow him back. He stuffed Kinsale into the performance school. Now the performance school and the industry in Ilyan are hosted and managed by Jose. Although Jose has made some minor mistakes, Du Lin believes in him. He can trust everyone who blocks the bullets for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sleeping, it was already four o'clock. After denying Dove's inquiry at home, Du Lin left the villa with someone. He didn't interfere with the group of jerk meetings during the day. It doesn't mean he doesn't want to know the details. It doesn't mean he won't make a little damage and let those people get guilty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 6:15 in the evening, most people start eating dinner, and the meal is God's power to give people, no exception. Mr. Jackson sat at the table, and he shook his napkin under his collar. As a free speculator and capitalist, he was very satisfied with his past record. . The first speculative speculators in the western mining industry, after making the first money, quickly transformed into the tobacco industry. At that time, others were not optimistic about the tobacco industry. Cheap cigarettes from the federal government dumped into the empire and destroyed many tobacco companies. . In addition, more people are willing to grow their own tobacco and are not willing to spend money to buy finished cigarettes. The tobacco industry is screaming. He thinks that the tobacco industry is promising for three reasons. The first point is that the handover of tariff rights is getting closer and closer. In any case, the empire will impose tariff rights. The hands of the federation were brought back, and by that time the federal cigarettes would gradually withdraw from the imperial market, leaving a large vacuum. Secondly, the number of people smoking will only increase, not less and less, the market is expanding, and so far has not seen the bottom, such a huge market means the guarantee of profits, and participate in the tobacco industry. Absolutely no loss. Thirdly, the empire has tax rebate subsidies for the planting industry, including tobacco planting, which has a certain amount of tax rebate policy. He took the opportunity to circle a large plot of land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be no money in the early stage, but as long as it continues, it will surely usher in a brilliant era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was keenly seized the opportunity to buy a bankrupt tobacco company and then started running his own denim cigarettes. At that time, many people said that his investment failed. He didn't care. Now, instead of looking back and forth, those who once stood on a higher position than him, who have been laughing at him, have now fallen to the bottom, but he is one step. Stepping up to a higher mountain, it became a man who “catch the pulse of the times”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the tobacco market is getting better and better, his income is getting higher and higher. He holds a lot of money in his hand and doesn’t know where to go. He opened two garment factories in the south, and now the industry is burning. very. Some time ago I heard that the two major banks were buying contracts in the west, and he also followed a wave of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich may have a lot of troubles, but one thing is very good, that is, someone will take the initiative to tell him how to make the fastest. With the help of his private team, he enrolled an insurance company to accept these policies on the condition that he was exempted from three-month premiums and given ten boxes of cigarettes. A very good strategy, many cowboys have given their contract to him to handle, let him hold hundreds of thousands of contracts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't look so happy, is it because of what happened during the day?", his wife asked, Mr. Jackson’s face after returning There is no smile, I have been squinting, this is not the same as in the past, so she asked very much, "If you don't know who to say, why don't you try to talk to me?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson squeezed a smile, but soon sighed and picked up the knife and fork and put it back. "The two big lines fight each other, but we Becoming a 'burial item', I have some concerns!", he is worried that there are other ideas or traps behind the Bailito loan of 50 million to them as a margin. None of these bankers is a good thing. If ordinary capitalists are abhorrent, they can make money by squeezing the labor of workers and raising the price of goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banker is evil, because the ultimate goal of the banker is to make everybody who borrows from the bank ultimately unable to pay, so that they can Earn a sum on someone else’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capitalist is just crushing the workers, but the bankers want people to break down. This is the difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50 million loans, if you can't return the money in the second year and still have the same amount of money - another 50 million The money, the company they set up in partnership will face huge troubles. Part of the trouble comes from the fact that they may be blocked by two major banks, which makes them difficult. In the third year, they can't afford the high interest, they can't pay the principal or return the principal, but they don't have enough guarantee to be expelled. industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, each of them will have to pay a large sum of money, the money invested will not be counted, and they will face huge losses, and will definitely hurt. Their foundation and vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
