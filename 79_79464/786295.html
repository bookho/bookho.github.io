			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke put a small gift in his hand on the table, which is a gold ore mine with two fist sizes, which has been specially modified. Charming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan just glanced back and took his gaze back, but at least the tight muscles on his face relaxed. This little thing is not a good thing for him at all, but the gift is focused on love and style. He fiddled with the coffee cup on the table and chuckled twice. "Mr. Luke, it seems that the purpose of your trip is not ordinary!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Ke is too lazy to open the topic and say something meaningless nonsense. He directly said the intention of the trip. "Mr. Juan, I was deceived by Du Lin! When I was most helpless, my first thought was you. I hope that you can give me some help and help me beat Du Lin's bastard!" He said that Du Lin was gnashing his teeth when he said the name. It seems to have forgotten. Just before today, he still thinks that Doolin is a good one. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan had some accidents and felt that it was normal. He smiled and shook his head. "Let's tell you, when you say that you were deceived by Doolin." After that, I was not surprised at all. He was such a person. When I spent a million to buy East Coast Entertainment Company, I encountered a similar thing. Eric lost a million. I am not sure. Did Dulin do it because I don't have any clear evidence to point to Doolin, but I don't think that the disappearance of Doolin and Eric can't get rid of it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "So I am not surprised by your experience. He is such a person, always deceiving friends who frame his side!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke first I heard about this incident, and Juan did not promote the scandal that he was cheated. He even had to take the initiative to suppress those who knew that they should not talk around, and Luke certainly did not know. If he knows, there is such a slight possibility that things will not become what they are today. To blame him, he is from the west, and it is not his home. Then he told Juan about what happened to him, hoping to get help from Juan. The smell of fragrant taste is bitter. When he is drinking coffee at this age, he no longer adds milk and sugar to it. "I can understand your pain now, whether you are a failure or a success, Du Lin is taking up. The cheaper person, but this is not so easy to solve!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan Biluk has more things to see, as far as academic qualifications are concerned. But one is in the developed eastern coastal areas, and the other is that there is no barren hills and mountains in the west, and the experience gap completely crushes Luke. After listening to Luke’s words, he knew what Dulin was planning, because the partnership with the George family was brought up by Du Lin and his Juan, so Luke gave him protection and had him. Juan played the striker and Du Lin was already ready to enjoy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that I hate Du Lin, Juan and Luke hate Du Lin as much as he does, and it took only a short day to reverse his concept of Doolin. When he knew that Doolin had personally contacted Ms. Chris, she began to hate this insatiable villain, so what happened to Luke made Juan feel the same. Sometimes when one person's dislike of another person reaches a certain level, it will make people lose some reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He wants to get something, we shouldn’t let him get it, it depends on whether you have enough courage!", Juan looked calmly. Luke, Luke also stared at him. For a moment, Luke nodded and nodded to indicate that Juan would continue. "He wants to get the most benefit if he wants to do nothing, then we should not be as he wished. He kicked out of the game!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luke frowned and asked: "But he is now a shareholder of Southern Film Company and has 50% of the shares, I can't kick him out for any reason or power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan laughed and said: "You can take the initiative to breach the contract and tell He will not build 60 cinemas and initiate the content of the breach of contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I have to pay six million for this. Luke felt that it was a very stupid thing to come to Juan. If it was so simple, he would be able to kick Du Lin out, he would still Come in? Huh smiled. "He can evaluate his company. Why can't you?" Continue to say, "In addition to the inability to move funds in the accounts of the South, there are only more than 30 cinemas that belonged to the Oriental Star Entertainment Company, and the cost of these cinemas is underestimated as much as possible. The asset control of the movie is less than 10 million, you can drive Doolin away with 5 million."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke heard that it was indeed One way, but the five million chips will drive out Du Lin, and he will not have much money in his hands. At the same time, he also realized that if he did this, he would definitely be a marginal person, not a leader in the next negotiation. He understood Juan's thoughts, drove out Doolin, and restricted himself. The last thing he got was his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke guessed Juan's mind, and Juan did not hide the meaning. "You may indeed lose money, but the loss is only a few hundred thousand! With such a loss, you will kick out Du Lin. Do you think it is not worth it? You Think about it, he has profited more than one million at most, but he lost a huge opportunity. The person who really wants to be sad should be him, not you and me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Furthermore, the cinemas that he gave you can sell to me if you don't want them. I can definitely make a price that makes you satisfied, maybe you can still make a fortune." Juan now dared to open the money, and the farmer couple provided him with a lot of cash, enough for him to eat the thirty-three cinemas in Luke's hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan was alert when he finished Luketon. He realized at this time that Juan’s goal was to build the cinemas that Du Lin had built before. There are four. According to Juan, eight million of cash came out of five million to send Du Lin, and he could leave three million and thirty-four cinemas. These cinemas were sold to Juan again. He did not lose anything and even earned tens of thousands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he will be kicked out of this game, what is it for now? What is it for crossing thousands of kilometers from the west to the east? Is it to create profits and opportunities for the Irians? Obviously not, he came to make money, he seems to have forgotten his original purpose. But if you keep these cinemas..., he looked up at Juan, who was in the presence of God, and asked: "Why don't we partner? Four people share certain interests, and no three people come here!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lukes have learned the lesson and have gained some experience. "We have become the closest partners by cross-shareholding, so that no one can sell anyone, everyone's The interests are also the same. I have you, you have me, only in this way can you reassure each other and use your strength to the same place! And Mr. Juan, there is not much time left for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke’s idea made Juan also stunned, and he held his chin and wondered if there was room for maneuvering. He didn't want to make a fortune with this western monk, but the current problem is like Luke's retelling what Du Lin said, leaving little time left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the George family’s delegation arrived in Irian, they must look at the resources in their hands, and if they find that they have only a hundred cinemas in their hands, I am afraid they will leave Irian immediately. When the number is not enough for the Georges to feel that monopolizing the industry will encounter difficult problems, they will not have the capital of cooperation. Compared with the George family, they are far from this qualification! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
