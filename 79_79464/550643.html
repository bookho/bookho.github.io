			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivienne looked at him with a smile. "I will talk to the Prandor Director. Do you remember the people who were yesterday?" Delier, this lady, Mrs. Vivian is still very reassured, because she knows that when one person has mastered what he can't grasp at this class level, except for the unreserved surrender, there is only the end of the world. A road can go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she is not afraid of Delier saying something that she can’t say. If she dares to do this, it means exposing these things and affecting her. Not too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus Delier has been looking for candidates for her, as well as other dignitaries, and has been working very hard, so Mrs. Vivian has a little bit of it. Heart. This time it’s just robbery. If the other party moves the knife or how he is, what should I do in the future? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delier immediately eagerly said: "I painted their portraits, I absolutely can't forget these people. Money is nothing, but they don't I should beat my handsome face!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivienne just smiled, handsome? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very satisfied with the gift you gave me. When I leave, I will give the portrait to me, I will deal with it.", said Vivian Raised his hand and swept the dust that did not exist on the shoulder of Delier. "You have done so many things for me, and I can't let you be wronged, isn't it?" She looked back at the "Jon" standing next to her. ", stretched out his hand, "Help me in, this skirt is too long, sometimes I will find myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha slightly hesitated, I helped Mrs. Vivian to walk into the Delil Art Museum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the back of the two people disappearing behind the promenade, Delier suddenly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a person who was similar to him who was robbed last night. Anyone who saw someone standing under the street lamp outside the dark lanes counted the thick hands. When you look at cash, you will have the urge to "if the money is my good." Some people are subject to the three views and the deterrent power of the law. They can only hide this idea in their hearts and then pass by silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are also some people who have long been accustomed to ignoring the deterrent brought to them by law and turning ideas into reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So a guy wearing a very fashionable purple neutral suit was dragged into the alley by several mobs and kindly greeted and took away. Money that does not belong to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these people, this may be just a trivial little thing, those who can’t offend they have long been deeply in mind, for a lifetime Do not forget. Obviously, the guys with this bit of money are not in it, so they have little pressure on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hundreds of dollars in cash is enough for them to spend a minimum of one month in the city of Tener, but they are not sure what they are doing What will happen to the boss who will give them boss. Their level is too low, so this thing can't completely blame them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, Du Lin’s idea was to take Mrs. Vivian’s line to the market, but soon he realized that his idea was a very The wrong idea included the line of Mrs. Vivian. Their status and level are much higher than the low-level people in Duolin. No matter what the other party needs, Du Lin can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't see Mrs. Vivian's kindness to communicate with some young men, but if she is allowed to do something, Du Lin thinks she will refuse. The reason is also very simple. She is just a "consumer". Consumers will never manage the difficulties of the manufacturers of the goods they use when they consume. They only care about whether they are satisfied with the use of goods. As for other They have nothing to do with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin directly changed the original idea, since there is no way to encourage Codor to cross the threshold, from a gang leader to a special city The tycoon, then send him to hell! He told his thoughts to the Buddha, and he felt that it was very reasonable and raised a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the plan has changed, does he need to go out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin told him an unfortunate fact. It was because of the change in his original plan that he not only needed to "sacrifice" but also The "sacrifice" of hard work is enough. Only in this way, let Mrs. Vivian's complete satisfaction with the "gift" that Delier gave her, she will produce a "squeaky" feeling of Delier's injury. This kind of emotion is more active than giving her money or something else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even need anyone to remind her, she will take the initiative to give Delier a sigh of relief, of course, the premise is that she must have happiness and happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin, standing in the alley across the road from the Delil Art Museum, looked at the sorrow hidden in the back of the Buddha’s back, and smiled and smiled. If the plan can be successful, it will be that the Buddha will not sell hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who can truly sacrifice, how can he not work hard? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, Du Lin shook the trench coat, the weather became colder and colder, and he bought a bacon bread from a food cart on the side of the road. Biting and looking at the door of the Delil Art Museum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about ten minutes, Mrs. Vivian’s red light came out from the inside, her pace was much lighter than when she entered, and her mouth was full of satisfaction. The curvature. Delier, who had a swollen face, followed her, and Du Lin did not see the Buddha. After Delil nodded and said something, he personally sent Mrs. Vivian to the car and watched the car disappear into the street before she wiped the sweat that did not exist on her head and rubbed her arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin swallowed the bacon bread in his hand and ran across the road. "How?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delier nodded. "I don't think there is a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jon?", talk about this The name of the hand Du Lin couldn't help but laugh, and all of them actually had a stage name... It was really gratifying! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on Delier’s face is very strange, always giving Duolin a wrong signal, it’s like... what! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He should be at rest, after all, a teenager, all aspects of physical fitness are so embarrassing.", Delier's sentence Obviously, the words are not completely finished. This is only a half sentence. It still leaves a space that is imaginative and has a long aftertaste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With three portraits, Mrs. Vivienne did not go home directly, but went to the Tenel police station and found that she had changed her clothes and was ready to go back. Home of Prando. She proudly placed three portraits on the table, and even looked too lazy to see Prando. She has such emboldened energy and energy, even if Prando is the police chief of the city of Tener, she does not dare to complain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
