			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reputation of the fellowship is very loud in the city of Tener. Almost everyone knows that there is such an organization, and that a person named Du Lin has been established. The fellowship. With a field of shopping, Du Lin led the fellows to kill one opponent, and finally became a force that can not be ignored! When people thought that Doolin would go on the old road of the tycoons, he disappeared, and after more than a year, followed by the overwhelming news about Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest smuggling channel in the East Coast underground world, the largest private liquor producer in the history of the Empire, and the leader with the largest number of members. The rumors of all kinds of rumors have put a mysterious veil on the fellow countrymen, which makes Du Lin no longer just a person, but also a magical symbol. The operation of the association has gradually turned into the dark, but the more people are jealous of the fellowship. For the unknown, people always have a fearful attitude, whether it is death or a fellowship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young people who came here once had a knife for Du Lin, and they had experienced the battle of nine deaths. He survived, but six brothers died. In the battle. Doolin asked if he would like to leave Tenell with himself. His answer was to stay here and to protect the city of Doyle, a city of special significance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boss, would you like me to pick you up?" When I saw Du Lin, the young man named Giusset directly ignored Mason and The police outside the door, it seems to him that it is not difficult to pick up Du Lin. He brought a hundred and twenty brothers this time, and he also equipped with 30 pistols and more than 100 kinds of long daggers and short knives, not to mention the small department such as the Trine Regional Police Station. Armed border patrols can all be played. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason was tempted by Giuseppe, so he is also the brother of Doolin. Can't you not respect yourself? In fact, Mason thought a lot, many people do not know that Mason is Doolin's brother, Doolin has been intentionally or unintentionally controlling the spread of news. Once everyone knows that Mason is Doolin's brother, I am afraid that Mason will lose his job. Obviously, the local mayor and governor of Tener will not allow a criminal family patriarch's brother to be a police officer, which has already involved a possible duty crime. In order to avoid further leakage in the future, leaving Mason to leave is the best choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pointed to the chair next to him, just now that Du Lin let Mason’s person inform the school’s principal and chairman that the next thing needed them to be present. . Dooling did not intend to deny it. He was originally doing it. He was willing to make active compensation, and he also believed that the school's people were willing to accept his compensation and forgive him and Dudu's wayward behavior. Anyway, it was a loss of property, no harm to anyone, no scare to the students, no need to compensate for the loss that has already been compensated, and people like Du Lin are too stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you bring the money?" Du Lin asked, and Giusset immediately nodded that he not only brought people and guys, but also brought some money. Dooling nodded. "It's very good, people get the money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the time, Giusette walked out of the room and stood in the hallway. Three whistles were blown outside, and immediately a young man walked into the police station with an inconspicuous cloth pocket. When he pushed the police station door, some police officers even stepped back. Their eyes were focused on the cloth bag, for fear that something suddenly exploded inside. When these police officers knew that they were arrested by Du Lin this evening, even if they said they were not afraid, they were still a little afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s fierce name is too strong, just to kill Wood in the street and to hang the traitor on the bell tower is enough to make people feel the heart of this young man. tyrannical. With so many messy rumors, the police officers who mobilized the police this night are not very good. I thought it was a big credit. I didn’t expect it to become a hot bomb. It’s not good, it’s not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man glanced at the policeman in the police station, and smiled a little, carrying the bag upstairs. When he completely disappeared into the stairway, some people thought that it should be stopped a little, asked the Secretary to let him go up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man entered the interrogation room and placed the cloth pocket on the table. Du Lin glanced at him and turned to ask Giusset. "This is your brother." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man and Giusset look alike, especially the hair on their heads has a little self-winding, just like a mold carved out The same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this is Du Lin’s sentence, let this young guy notice Du Lin, the more he looks more confused, and then suddenly thinks about what Excited by the face, he did not realize that Du Lin was here, standing helplessly, and did not know how to stand. I don't know if it was a rib or a block. He suddenly ran over and picked up Doolin's left hand and kissed the cat's eye gems on Du Lin's index finger. Then he looked up and said, "Du Lin... Sir, I admire. You!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesset’s eyes closed, his brother’s move actually had a lot to do with him, the last time he met Like his brother described the process of the grand meeting, which included every president and agent will kiss the ring on Du Lin’s index finger, and proud to say that he also kissed the ring. . This made his brother always very embarrassed, and all the children in the street worship Du Lin very much, including their family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of Dooling changed the dilemma of the life of the Guar people, allowing them to eat a full stomach while also saving some money. Du Lin also established a free school for them, almost completely free hospital, Du Lin brought them The hope of living has brought a bright future. People praised Doolin, praised Doolin, and began to deify Dulin. In such an environment, Du Lin is like the first king in history, unbeatable and powerful, full of wisdom and courage, leading the Guars to defeat one enemy after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every young man follows Du Lin as an example, and Du Lin becomes the most respected person. Suddenly I saw a living Du Lin in front of myself, and Giusset’s younger brother completely lost control. He didn't know that not everyone could kiss the ring on his index finger, and only those who got a certain position could do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people make mistakes are allowed, even the gods will not be embarrassed, the first king has done a lot of wrong things when he was young, let alone an ordinary Young people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin raised his hand, he knew what he was thinking, and smiled as he put the cigarette in his pocket in the hands of Doolin. Of course, it also includes a lighter. Du Lin ordered one by himself, and then threw one to the young man. The young man caught the cigarette in a hurry and the whole person stood as if he was stupid. Until Du Lin stood up, he went to him and lit the lighter. The swaying flame attracted the young man's heart. Du Lin spit a cigarette. "What is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jupiter, Mr. Doolin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at Giusset, who didn't know whether to cry or laugh. Du Lin regained his gaze and looked at the big boy in front of him. "Put the smoke on...", Jupiter slammed the cigarette, carefully sucked a small sip and spit it out. "And, later Call me boss!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jupiter’s pupil almost expanded to the limit at this moment, and quickly contracted, his body shook slightly, of course Knowing the true meaning of Doolin's more work, from now on, he is at least a captain's leader. Even if he can't follow Du Lin's departure from Turner, the status here is a bit lower than his brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of luck came too fast, and the young man almost jumped up excitedly. "Mr. Doolin, no, boss, I am so excited, I don't know. How do I express what I want to express. I mean I am very excited. I have regarded you as a goal and role model that I have to follow since I was young. I am so excited. Sorry, I should close my mouth now..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
