			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nervous and fearful environment, the speed of intellectual decline is beyond the awareness of people, often in things that they don’t usually believe in, Under such an emotional atmosphere, it will become suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From dawn, the whole western region is circulating a "small gossip". I don't know who is the first to release it. It has spread throughout the western part of the night. . This uncertain news pointed to a series of recent changes in the West to the behind-the-scenes black-handed mine. The news said that most of the people who have been assassinated so far are some people who have hatred with the West Mine, including Doolin, including The Mennon also included the Executive Committee of the Western Mining Association and Hendry and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contradiction with Doolin comes from the fact that the West Mine has pitted Dolly’s tens of millions of funds, which is an amazing number, once Doolin wants to pick up When the legal weapons are used to defend their rights, the West Mines and the mine owners who sell the waste mines to Doolin will have a bad mold. Everyone has already seen Du Lin’s specialty in the lawsuit. He has been in a lawsuit since he started his family, but it is amazing that he has not lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives great pressure to some people inside the West Mine. Once this incident is on the bright side, the official begins to intervene, then the West Mine will be in the west. The authority of the inevitably will quickly decline. People will not believe that a treacherous miner has defrauded Doolin’s unofficial organization of tens of millions of funds, which will also lead to more problems, such as how the West Mine will be profitable in the West and how it is controlled. Western minerals in foreign trade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the West Mine will have the necessary motivation and profit, they have the possibility of assassinating Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contradiction between the West Mine and the Mennon has been in existence for a long time. Since the doorman entered the political arena, he has been unable to pass the West Mine. He proposed All kinds of methods want to restrict the tentacles of the mine owners in the west and the west mines. Although they all fail, they do not mean that they will always fail. Once the tenant has become the governor and has been helped by outside capitalists, he is likely to directly formulate a law that belongs to him in the west, so the good days of the mine owners and the West Mine will pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a huge loss, will the people of the West Mines choose to compromise? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, they chose to assassinate the doorman to end the incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for why some executive members and mine owners inside the West Mine were also assassinated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is very simple. Some places will inevitably have positions. Different positions naturally create contradictions and then develop into conflicts. Several executives and miners colluded with Du Lin's so much money. If they were alive, the handles they left behind would always exist and be demolished. Anyone can use their stupid things to attack the West Mine, plus the competition within the Western Mines for power, then the assassination is clearly the easiest and safe way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for some people may consider whether the West Mine will be mentally retarded. Is it not a brain to launch such a dense assassination in such a short time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the very widely spread news, the explanation was also given. It was because they arranged such intensive assassination that they could take people’s attention from the West Mine. The body is removed, let people question, reflect, and finally "discover" that this has nothing to do with the West Mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This message is as if it is true. The person who gave this message seems to have participated in so many assassinations all the time, let people I can't tell if this is true or not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, is it really more likely? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is of course fake!", the doorman sat on the hospital bed, his brows tightly twisted together, gunshot wounds on his arms and shoulders He has been suffering from severe pain until now. Especially at the moment when the effect of the anesthetic was exhausted, he felt like he was being knives in the wound for several times with a knife. The pain all the time continually stimulates his nerves, giving him a sense of irritability with a headache. "The group of people in the West Mine will not be so short-sighted. The west is turbulent and it is the first to be affected by the impact. If they do, they will It is equal to digging a grave for yourself, so it must not be them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the room are silent, these people are the real confidants of the Mennon, In the eyes of Shapke, these people have turned away from the lofty ideals and become the running dogs of the capitalists like the doormen. Their current status, status, and wealth come from the doormen, so they sincerely hope that the farmers can continue to go and lead them to gain more benefits. For this reason, they are willing to give up the principles. After all, this is a Isn't money society? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new era that I wanted in the past has also come. People are no longer slaves of oppressive exploitation. Everyone is free and equal between people... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to Shapk’s things?" Three days ago, the Mennon commanded his assistant to seize Shapk’s family. Forcing him to admit that he had created an assassination case, and as a result, firmly grasped the initiative, and then based on this, cleared the Kadima party. He doesn't need subordinates who are disobedient. They should leave here and go out to pursue their illusory ideals. It is best not to come back forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His assistant shook his head with a cold face, and the doorkeeper jumped his heart. "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our people are missing, and there are no traces of the battle at the scene. They have completely evaporated with Shapk’s family. So far we have no further news."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When his assistant said this thing that did not follow his wishes again, Mennon’s head hurts even more. He hopes that Shapk does not know about it, or does not know. How to use this matter is definitely a mistake and a wrong decision. Of course, the Mennon also understands that this mistake does not require responsibility. The ghost knows that he has used some of the hidden forces to suddenly attack Shapke’s home and has failed. This failure is not his responsibility. He can only say sand. Puck the fox is too embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After licking the temple, Mennon sighed a little. After Du Lin came here, his days were not normal, and many things became impossible. Mastered, he hated this feeling. "How is the guy next door? Is it dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There has been rescued, the doctor said that it will almost be finished. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman sighed and sighed. He shook his head and said, "Go out and spread the news, saying that the person who assassinated me was Shapke." People, they also believe in the set of the past bloody dawn, so I want to get rid of me. By the way, I tell everyone, I will completely break with them, contribute their own finals to safeguard the integrity of the empire and social security. Strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the room got a good spirit and they bowed their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know that these people and the dawn of blood at this moment are finally completely separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The predecessor of the Kadima Party is the bloody dawn, which almost everyone knows is a secret that everyone knows but cannot disclose. But this does not mean that the Kadima Party is a bloody dawn. The "realists" led by the doormen have been deepening cooperation with the capitalists and pushing the Kadima Party to have more and larger stages in the imperial political arena. These actions are bound to make similar A guy like Shapke feels resentful. Because what they are doing now is not much different from what the nobles did before, which is contrary to the program and purpose of the Dawn of Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is a step that has to be taken. Destruction will never allow the doorman to become the dominant will of this empire. He must change according to the rules of this game. The way you behave, get everyone's approval. When he did not make this decision, he knew that one day he would definitely have a knot with the bloody dawn, because the Kadima Party is his, not Mr. Kesma, not Shapuke, this is not a bloody dawn. This is the Kadima Party, a political party headed by a doorman, not an assassination squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is looking forward to the arrival of this day, and he is very afraid of the arrival of this day. He does not know how many people will stand on their own side, and it is even less clear. After Mr. Ma knew about it, would he send him a black card? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, he must make a decision, because Shapuk’s sudden attack made him realize that this is the biggest crisis in his political life, he already There is no retreat and no power to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is also the biggest turning point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire’s high-level rejection of the Kadima Party, and the old party’s intention to come over and suppress them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they used to be the dawn of the blood, they have assassinated many great aristocrats, so the real core of this empire is not willing to accept them. Before the doormen often thought about how to reverse people's cognition of the Kadima party under the premise of peace, let him have a higher ceiling, but at this moment, he knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say goodbye to the past! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From today, he wants to let everyone know that he is a player who follows the rules, is a politician who is actively moving closer to the highest will of the empire, is a safe Ordinary people, and he also did to see the entire empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
