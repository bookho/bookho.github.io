			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of fortune is always the goddess of the loser, the excuse for the loser to find his own failure, the goddess that the loser will never get, but every day The winner is under the pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin never dared to gamble his future on "lucky", so the tombstone on the tomb has grown moss, he thinks there is after hanging up the phone Perhaps this is the person who is the Organized Crime Investigation Bureau. At present, only this newly established department has the possibility to target him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone wants to do something big to attract everyone’s attention, gain valuable recognition and resources, if they can knock out a mayor, and this The mayor is still the head of an organized criminal group, and I am afraid that the entire Western world will shake. After all, such a terrible political scandal is enough to kill many people, such as Harry, such as Magus, for example, many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will it be the human hand that Bowworth arranged? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be this possibility, so Du Lin just made a phone call with Magus and told him that someone was investigating himself recently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marguez’s opinion is that he can’t move, and the troubles that can be cut off are cut off. He will investigate who is actually at this sensitive moment. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nashua’s imagination was much faster than Doulin’s imagination. On the third day, Du Lin saw her, she wore clothes and neutral clothes, from The inner smile made this chick a little radiant. With her hands behind her back, she kicked her feet at every step, so Duin seemed to feel cola when she was so naive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why would you like to hire me to help you manage the company? Don't you know that my father and my grandfather are hitting your company's idea?" She said with a small threat: "Be careful, I sent your employees to our homes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is of course impossible. If Nasha really wants to do this, Du Lin will definitely raise her hands to welcome her to do so. Hundreds of employees who signed a contract with a huge amount of default will directly bring Doolin’s breach of contract with hundreds of millions of dollars. Lin was able to swallow the George family directly. Of course, this is just a thought, as long as the normal people see the contracts that are tens of millions of liquidated damages, any thoughts will be extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Du Lin was able to guarantee his own heart when he was deceiving. He stopped and turned to look at Nasha very seriously, which made Nasha a little uncomfortable to take a step back. In her impression, Du Lin always smiles in the smirk and sneer, and it is really hard to accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I trust you!", Du Lin's tone is very firm, he repeated, "I trust you like I trust myself!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Du Lin’s burning eyes, Nasha’s cheeks were covered with a layer of pink, and she regained her smile and snarled in a seemingly bright tone. “ Who believes, maybe you guys have any conspiracy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you trust you is also a conspiracy, then you should have a conspiracy!" Du Lin regretfully shrugged and continued to move forward. Nasha snorted and followed two steps to keep up with his pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really want to hire me as the vice president of the Empire Star?" Nasha couldn't help but ask, not only she felt incredible, she The father also felt incredible, and her grandfather felt incredible. When she knew the news, her father told her that she must agree to it, and then arrange her own people. The operation method of learning the star of the country, including various projects and ideas, must be copied. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the election, they will launch the George family tape media company in February next year, and compete with Doolin and more companies. This film has not been developed yet. The market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this generation of grandparents and grandchildren can’t figure out what kind of tricks Dulin is doing, knowing that the fox wants the piece of meat in his hand, but he puts the meat directly Was sent to the fox's mouth, isn't it true that the fox ran away with the meat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any case, this is an opportunity to learn the best way of doing business in a new field, and it’s good for the George family. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked up at the building in front of the two and stepped in. "We will immediately sign the testimony of all the company's management and key employees." Two years of employment contract, if you can lead the company to develop enough market after two years, I will continue to use you and give you a certain share. If you can't do it, you can only say goodbye, you only have two years. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha looked at Du Lin's back with a strange expression. It is reasonable to say that she should hate Du Lin, but she was a little bit mad by this guy's hippie smile or disgusting. She felt that Du Lin was very interesting. It’s more interesting than the ones she met when she was at school, more fun than those who look sultry and have a pus in their bones. She likes the relaxed short time when she is with Du Lin. She doesn't know why, but she understands that when someone can trust you so much, you should repay this trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She licked her fist and followed the door of the company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the company’s management team including the main employees gathered together, and I have to say that Freina did a good job in the past six months, at least she got the most Most employees are recognized. When Du Lin told the company to change the vice president, he also encountered some minor troubles. Some of the founding personnel even proposed the idea of ​​resigning together, and he did not hesitate to completely separate the boundaries with the film industry for Fleina in five years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there is Freina’s explanation and appeasement. These people realize that the company is no longer a big one, and the market is no longer only their own. More and more predators are entering this market. In order to survive and thrive, the company must exchange for a capable performer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin walked into the conference room, there was a round of applause in the conference room, and Nasha, behind Du Lin, couldn’t help but laugh, she The low-headed laughter said behind Du Lin: "It seems that your employees don't seem to like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin married her when she turned around. At first glance, smirked and retorted, "In fact, they don't like you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the crowded employees in the conference room, smiling Said: "Today is a very important day. My newly appointed vice president, Ms. Nasha George, will sign a two-year contract with the company under the witness of everyone. In the next two years, Ms. Nasha will be comprehensive. Responsible for all the company's operations and decisions, let us welcome!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha took a step forward, slightly owed, the applause in the conference room was in Freina The beginning of the applause gradually rang. In fact, most people don’t have much hostility when they saw Nasha. I have to say this. Although many parts of society are sexist in many cases, women may therefore have some special aura, such as "non-hazardous" this label. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes women more acceptable, and the company's former vice president, Freina, is also a woman, and the replacements that people themselves don't realize are good enough for them to pass through this transition period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very pleased that Mr. Du Lin was able to choose me to become the vice president of this company. At the same time, it also made me very scared. I was still questioning in the past moment. Own, can you do the job well, can you meet Mr. Doolin’s expectations of me...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Nasha’s conversation Many people said that they had a special inauguration speech. Du Lin lamented that if a big family wants to train a person, the time it takes is often short-lived that ordinary people can't think of. She only needs to throw her in several big scenes to force her to stand in front of the stage, she can quickly adapt to this occasion, and quickly mature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do people often say that the education of the big family is better than the education outside? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is a kind of incomprehension to the big family. The so-called elite education is nothing more than using money to find a guy who can be alone. if not? It's very simple. If you change your personal money, there will always be a successor who can take responsibility. As for the money that is lost, it is nothing compared to the money of a successful heir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena looked at Nasa with a smile on her face, but there was a flaw in her heart that could never be relieved. She is bigger than Nasha, about two years old, but she is far worse than Nasha from any angle. The world is really cruel. She has worked so hard. She has persisted in the face of endless difficulties and bumps, but she lost to a girl who has not experienced any storms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the world is really fair, is everything that she is facing now fair? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or... is it unfair? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A round of applause brought Freina back to reality from her thoughts, and she immediately patted her palm and smiled and nodded to Nasha, then looked at Du Lin and Na Shah signed an employment contract in front of everyone, and the matter was settled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While reluctantly, Freena handed over the keys to the office of the vice president and told some of the places that needed to be noted to Nasha. After taking a turn in each department of the company, Nasha smiled and put the things she had packed into the trolley, and left the company one step at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
