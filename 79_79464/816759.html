			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after Mr. Xema received a letter of apology from Mennon, he just glanced at it and said to Mrs. The letter is not written by him, but it is written by a blind man. He can't write such a good-looking word."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;瘸子, now the housekeeper next to the doorman, he The real name has long been forgotten, and there are many aliases. Xunzi was an aristocratic tutor before he joined the bloody dawn. His legs were interrupted by aristocratic children, and he was interrupted with a wooden stick for ten times. Since then, he has had the nickname, Mr. Xingma’s mouth. He said that he was not able to see it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy was soft and weak at the time, and Sven Wenwen was actually a monk. At that time, the doctor said that the legs could be kept, but if he wanted to, he asked the doctor if there was any way to avoid it. The doctor told him to put in a steel bar and then fix the leg bones with a special wire that was very thin but very strong. It wouldn't look too embarrassing. He agreed, and then screamed in bed for more than a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that after a week, it’s not hurting, but the scorpion is dumb and can’t be shouted. From then on, everyone will respect him as “scorpion”. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Ma’s looked at the gorgeous font on the letter and nodded. “It’s indeed the word of the scorpion. The doorman’s guy can’t write it, What did you write?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma threw the letter to Mrs. Ma, and then lay in the easy chair and squatted on the pipe. Two. When Mrs. Wexma had read the letter and asked him what he had planned, Mr. Kemma’s face was a little smile. “He has apologized, then that’s all right.”, facing Kesma Mrs. Kesma continued to say, "He wants to hurt the son of Doolin's bastard, telling Du Lin about it, let him solve it himself."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he does not do well, he will come back and plant the land with me. When he brings back the girl of Ah, and regenerates a few children, he will be perfect in his life."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the older generation of Mr. Kesma, reality is reality, ideal is ideal. In the past, he could challenge the decaying aristocratic notice for his ideals, but now he can also let go of everything and live the life he wants in the new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may not be clear to Mr. Kesma that Du Lin is much bigger than he imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Irian, Amp has been studying for a long time around Juan’s “suicide” case, and he feels that the case is not as simple as it seems, or He imagined to be more complicated. He always felt that he might have overlooked something and could not easily concatenate all indirect evidence. In these clues and indirect evidence, the most important part is missing, which can directly give Du Lin a heavy blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he temporarily put down the case, but took a roundabout approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hotel room, the police investigation officer who was transferred from other places sat around him. He wrote with charcoal on the white walls of the hotel. Writing and drawing, while doing the destruction, said: "I recently collected some rumors about Doolin from the mouth of Irian's citizens. I think this will be the most powerful evidence to defeat Du Lin from the side." The charcoal pen circled several names. "Not long ago, the provincial sages wanted to protest that Du Lin did not use the provincial sage. For this reason, the workers' union was united to launch a demonstration, but then the parade did not start, check the specific occurrence. "What's the matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second point, Doolin is in Irian, who runs a civil society called the fellowship in Tener, I think this Something that Doolin is very concerned about may be hidden in the organization, to find out the members of the fellowship and what they are doing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third point, check one Check this Carter. Some people say that Carter offended Irian Ben. The celebrity Fowlers family, then his wife left the local, and the Fowlers family disappeared, I think there may be problems in this, check it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Amp put down the charcoal in his hand, patted the palm of his hand, wiped the toner on the handle of a blackened towel, and said very seriously to the agents present: "We are not facing ordinary criminals." He has very high-level criminal means, very clever mind, and is good at playing with people. What you think is evidence is not necessarily evidence, you must find witnesses!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his watch. "We don't have much time. If you can't catch Du Lin in the next ten days, then he is very likely to escape the legal sanctions. Gentlemen, please. Host justice for justice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arranging the mission, Amp continued the case of Juan in the hands of the researchers. Now that the case has reached a dead end, no witnesses mean that the indirect evidence in his hands cannot create a new definition of Juan's death. Without the executor, if you can't find the executor, there is no way to get involved with Du Lin. In these few days, he found out about forty suspected people by comparing the only clear footprints on the scene with the shops of all the shoemakers in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people have strong evidence that they are not on the scene..., he frowned and meditated for a while, dialing the phone number of the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? You said that Juan’s body has not been buried yet?” Amp was surprised. As far as he knew, Juan was bankrupt and owed A lot of money, but his family are still there, Du Lin does not seem to continue to pay the bill, so that his family still has a retreat. Maybe life is not as rich and expensive as it used to be, but it is always better than ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the property that Hu’an mortgaged at the time was his real estate, and he did not mortgage his family’s private property. It is possible to change a few thousand or more, so his family should be able to live. Amp thought that Juan had been buried. In the empire, as long as it is not a criminal case and refuses to bury the family, most families will bury the dead as soon as possible so that they can return to the embrace of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Juan did not bury it, which made Amp feel awkward and a little more thought. He questioned the police officer who answered the phone. The police officer told him that his family did not come to claim the body after the death of Juan, nor did he say that he was buried in the cemetery. The police station is too lazy to be self-disciplined. What if the family of Juan comes to trouble? The police officers also provided a message that Juan’s children were said to have been demobilized to other places some time ago. On the way back, they should wait until their families get together before considering the issue of burial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp immediately took the clothes and went to the police station. In the morgue, he saw the bloodless Juan... It’s hard to see from the outside. This pile... is Juan. It is difficult for people who jumped from the building to maintain their basic appearance. When they fall from the upstairs, the huge impact will cause the head to bear a huge impact, and the limbs will twist and break in the unconscious swing. The internal organs of the abdominal cavity It may be squeezed out of the gang door, or it may tear the skin and spray it directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan’s body is very bad. In addition to the internal organs, the head is flat and the limbs are distorted. The most important thing is the clothes on his body. Not at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
