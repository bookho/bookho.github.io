			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shapk’s health is not good, his age is already great, and his body can’t afford any serious injuries. Not to mention the use of electric penalties such as smuggling, which has a certain amount of damage, even if it is a few punches, maybe he can send him to see the gods. The military has no way for such people. It can't be beaten, and intimidation doesn't work. But today, they have found a very effective means, that is, family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 40-year-old body member of the bloody Dawn organization, who was unable to bear torture and the family’s death in front of him, said some of him I shouldn’t have said anything, such as where Shapk’s family went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shapk and Mennon had already sent their families to the Federation through some channels before the fallout, and he has worked with the Mennon for many years. How much less "earn" some money, enough for his family to live a wealthy life relative to ordinary people on the federal side. There is no perfect person in this world, even a party party whip like Shapke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always some fragile side, or weaknesses, family members, and often the weakness of most people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to provide a safe, stable and relatively rich life, Shapke also gave up some persistence before he exchanged such a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will not speak, not only because of his persistence and enthusiasm for the bloody dawn, but also because he and all the members of the bloody dawn organization fear the leader. He slowly closed his eyes and refused to see these people wandering around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Shapke, I think you still cooperate with us best, we don't want to hurt anyone, but some people have to pay for what they do! This person is not you, you don't have to give up the power to love life for others." The officer in charge of the trial is very magnetic and not at all ferocious. He looks only in his thirties, a very clean person. The clean and tidy military uniform is worn on his body, bringing out his temperament, even more attractive than some models wearing fashionable clothes, attracting people's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for five minutes, Shapke still has no intention of confessing, fatigue, intimidation, threats, and most relatively mild methods have been used. But Shapke still said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer snorted and his face showed some helpless expression. He put the pen in his hand on the notebook. "Today's trial is over. I hope that when you are resting, think about it by the way, don't force us. Use some unsatisfactory practices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shapk opened his eyes at this time because the boy said a phrase like "no honor", able to The person who spoke the phrase often came from the bottom of the society and had a background in the gang. He stared at the young officer and looked at him more, and closed his eyes. Not long after, the two soldiers pushed Shapk back to a closed room in a wheelchair and closed him and left him alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one came to interrogate him on the second, third and longer days, until the fourth day, he was sent to the interrogation room again. Looking at the young, familiar officer, Shapke remained silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young officer smiled at him and said good afternoon. After that, the mirror that occupied the majority of the wall in the room shrank into the wall, revealing a single transparent glass. In another room, he saw his family. He did not show how to be shocked and scared. He remained calm and he was so calm after being arrested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your family, don’t you say hello to them?" The officer smiled and knocked on the glass window that had become transparent, and the room suddenly sounded for a while. The noise, but soon subsided, "You can hear them, I respect your loyalty to the organization, but unfortunately not everyone is like you. In these few days we got more Valuable news, for us, the secrets you keep are not necessarily as important as you think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad... is it you? "Where is this?", the voice of his daughter suddenly came out of the horn, and the other side of the glazing, a woman who appeared to be in her forties turned out to have a pleasant expression, and it seemed that there was no restriction on the opposite side. The power they speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside her, there is Shapu's son-in-law and two grandchildren and a granddaughter. The family looks very frightened, only his daughter still keeps Calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shapke kept his head on his family, but he remained silent, the young officer smiled and reached for three on the glass window. under. Two soldiers appeared in the glass window. One of them reached out and grabbed a grandson of Shapk. His family wanted to protect the child, but was broken by another soldier with a butt. The child was taken to a place close to the glass window. The muzzle's muzzle was on the head of the sobbing child. The young officer said with a smile. "Perhaps in your mind, loyalty is more important to you than anything." , including your family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looks like you are confident that you are a person who can keep secrets and loyalty, then let us experiment. I heard that you like your grandson very much, then your loyalty is more important, or is your grandson more important? "The other side of the glass window rang the crying and pleading of the family. Although Shapk’s daughter was crying, she said nothing. Instead, his son-in-law suddenly broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, tell them what these bastards want to know, then let's get out of here! Nothing is more important than a family, your insistence Let us fear each other and what can we do? Even if we all die here, the person you are loyal to may not even know what happened here!", his son-in-law crying and crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen!", the young officer smiled and pointed to his son-in-law. "This is the choice that normal people should make."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have a minute, if you can't give me the answer I want after one minute, then I am very sorry, I may have to take away the life of your grandson, I hope you I can understand that this is also not what I want!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time by bit, Shapk’s gaze has been concentrated on the face of his grandson. Seeing that there is no time, Shapuk finally spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is very hoarse, full of rough graininess, and extraordinarily low, "Give me a pen!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank God!", the son-in-law across the glass window folded her hands and bowed her head to thank all the gods. His children, including him and their family, did not need to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young officer was very satisfied with putting a pen and a piece of paper in front of Shapke, and Shapke picked up the pen and looked at the white paper. Did not immediately write, seems to be remembering. The young officer did not urge him. He had interrogated a lot of people. He also knew that at this moment, Shapk’s inner world was full of guilt and a thrill of being betrayed. All that is needed now is to wait and wait for Shapke to take the initiative to ignite the thrill of betrayal and then write everything out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person moves from firm to vacillating, he is destined to lose all his positions in the end, and no one has ever changed this truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about five minutes, Shapke suddenly quickly held the pen in his hand at the speed of his age, and the pen tip was facing up. The young officer’s face suddenly showed amazement and he could not continue. Keep calm, the calf swaying and sprinting, but still a slow step! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shapk did not hesitate to insert the nib into the throat deeply. His occlusal muscles bulged high and the skin on his face was somewhat Tightening up. The moment the pen tip pierced his throat, he held the pen in his hands and pushed it to the left. The sharp tip of the pen tore the muscles, and a sharp bulge on the left neck, the bulge was quickly punctured, and the blood spurted out like a twisted faucet from a blood vessel that was picked up by a pencil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young officer’s fingertips have touched Shapke’s arm, but he knows that it’s too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are simple medical treatments here, the serious injury such as the fracture of the neck artery is not the medical equipment that can be saved here. There is no blood bank here. There are no blood bags ready. Shapk calmly put the pen full of blood back on the table and pressed it to the top of the pure white paper. His eyes sparkled with sarcasm, and the resentful smirk on his face caused serious damage to the young officers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, with a bang, Shapke’s head was intimately hugged with the desktop and never lifted up again. On the table covered with blood, there is a particularly glaring white paper, in addition to some blood on the white paper, there is a pen with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young officer sat down on the chair, he took out a pack of cigarettes and ordered him, and he was now unable to hear the sound from the speaker. the sound of. After he smoked about half a cigarette, his inner temper could no longer be suppressed, and he stood up and slammed on Shapk. The wheelchair slides back and pulls a distance from the table, and the old man is planted on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is facing his face, but his face still seems to be sneer at the moment before his death, and the faint stunned eyes in his eyes are flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young officer slammed Shapk’s body insanely, and after a while, he straightened up and finished the dress and pushed the door away. Go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, he appeared in the room behind the glass window, holding a pistol in his hand, and he did not hesitate to buckle against Shapk’s family. Moved the trigger. The gunshots, as well as the screams and the cry of help, spread out, but he didn’t care at all, madly venting his anger and a trace of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
