			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The postman did not go, Mr. Kesma let Mason leave Sethi, he has some other uses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when Mr. Xmasma heard that a woman wearing a mask was searching for the news of Zijing Town, she knew who the woman was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any hatred that can make a woman keep chasing after her, even if they can’t forget their group after more than 20 years, then only One possibility. Plus before Walter... No, what Johnson said, he knew that this woman is Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Xerma’s dinner is not as rich as people think, and most people in Zizhen’s town have not considered Mr. How rich it will be. Like many years ago, as long as there are two things, meat and bread, it will be very satisfying. If you can add some fresh leaves and soup, it is definitely a "rich" dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just three people on the table at Mr. Xerma’s house this evening, the name of Johnson, who has been living in painful memories, the older, the older The shorter the day, he suspected that his wife and the dragon had a leg of Layton, and the brothers and sisters who had rumors of dragons and bloodlines were also the youngest son of Layton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Zachma slaughtered a sheep for them and made five roast chickens. Don’t underestimate these guests and members of the Xema family. The amount of food, the half-size boy and the girl eating something is just a feeling of fear, how can their little belly hold so much? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the silent meal time, Mrs. Ksma returned to the upstairs with Mr. Knoxma and other children, she knew that her husband had something to say. Have a chat with these three guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My son, Mason, you all know. He called me and told me a message that shocked me!" In the words, Mr. Xerma took out his own pipe for many years from his pocket, and took a sip after he clicked. He leaned against the back of the chair and looked at the cracked ceiling, as if he was caught in the memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with Mr. Zema, who has known Layton for more than 30 years, he knows his friend very well, he must not remember anything, he is waiting for " step". So he asked with a funny smile: "Oh? What news can make you so surprised, I can't wait to know!", he can't wait to add a tone to the word, Mr. Xema suddenly "returned to God ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He snorted and his eyes were full of enthusiasm. "Anna is back, just in Tener."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already abstaining from alcohol and aliasing Johnson Walter suddenly stood up, his movements were a little big, shaking the table, and even the chair he was sitting was bounced out of his straight legs. There was some kind of unspeakable hatred in his eyes, like hatred, but there was something else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, Walter was drinking every day and drunk. They have asked doctors, doctors and bad doctors for Walter, all of whom have the same diagnosis, but the vocabulary used is somewhat different depending on whether they are good or bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good doctor: "This patient has been very irritated, so his mental state is very poor, sometimes there are severe headaches. I suggest him long-term Taking painkillers to relieve some things I don't know will make him feel better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad doctor: "He is a neuropathy, do you know neuropathy? He has a problem with his brain, and he can't cure it. I suggest that if he comes to him, he will be relatively quiet. Right, you can't come to play cards at night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt is to numb yourself and relieve the pain in your head. Cheap drinks are cheaper and more accessible than expensive painkillers, so he is always drunk Like mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he saw Anna, Anna had not recognized him yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that day on, he found that his head was not hurting, and there would be no more hallucinations, so he quit drinking, which was called "some" by some people. The incredible strange things in Zijing Town are said to involve ghosts and religion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But old friends know why he is good, because he knows that he can’t escape, everyone is psychologically prepared for the arrival of this day, so now Did not show how surprised expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?", Layton asked, he is Mr. Xerma’s assistant, in the past nearly 70% of the assassinations. All of his figures appeared, and the things he showed himself were much more ferocious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Xerma extended his finger and motioned, indicating that Walter sat down. "This is also the reason why I invite you to eat. Hey, I am old. Mason can't even kill a cow." Things need to be solved, so they are handed over to you. If you have any different ideas, you can ask them before you leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Layton shook his head, His younger son also shook his head, and the eyes of the three were concentrated on Walter. Walter’s expression was very distorted, and no one could afford to kill his beloved wife and kill his children and parents in front of him. He could not do it. He used to shun in the past, but the last time he saw Anna, he found that there was another emotion in his heart that had been hidden by him. He wanted revenge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good opportunity, and Mr. Xema also gave him this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lowered his head and pressed his fists on his knees. After a moment, he pressed his head hard, "I am going!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, very good, then is it possible for me to continue to call you Walter from today?" Mr. Xmasma sighed with satisfaction, "damn Johnson, This is what broke the name, or Walt is nice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kemer raised his hand slightly, "Gentlemen, I have let Sethi give The woman got a black post, tomorrow night at 12 o'clock, let the blood stain red and dark!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study of the night and a lot of calls, Anna did not Leaving Turner, since many of the materials are now based on paper media, there is a lot of trouble in accessing them. For example, in order to avoid taking up more space, it has been packaged and thrown into the warehouse area. It is not an easy task to find a document from a pile of data packages. First of all, physical strength is not an ordinary person. Can't eat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, some of the feedback from the department needs further processing, such as getting more information from the local police station, or what else is there locally? People know some more insiders and so on, so she will stay in Tener for two days. Two days later she left, went to the west to meet with Anpu, and finally helped them find out those who had created terrorist attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the afternoon, Anna looked through the room and read the information that had been seen several times. Amp taught her a little secret, if I found something If you don't have a clue, then look at all the data in order, and constantly change the order of the look-and-see. It is very possible to find something that has not been discovered from the existing evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, she went out and relaxed. In fact, she also had a bit of inexplicable panic in her heart. She has been chasing this group for more than 20 years, and spent almost her entire life, even her own face. Confessed to go out. Now hope is in front of her, she has a hunch, I certainly did not find the wrong direction this time, but the more certain, the more there is something in my heart that can't be said. So she found an excuse to go out to do things in the afternoon, actually went for a walk, alleviating the psychological burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tnel has no fun place, the new mayor is caught in the struggle with the old party camp, there is no effort to develop the city, everywhere Filled with a decadent atmosphere. The roadside people wearing dresses and high hats, the high-spirited people who looked full of disdain looked at the sly inferiors who walked by their side, and the chins that were raised made them almost unable to see the road ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street corner always stands with a group of young people whose eyes stay for a moment in every person passing by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very bad city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna stopped and stopped, finally found a park outside the city center, walking in a quiet park, watching the trees and flowers that had sprouted, she no The expression can't have any expression. I found a stone bench and sat down. She pulled out a cigarette and then pulled out the necklace she had been carrying from her neckline. Wearing a pendant on the necklace, the very common one, the outside is a nice pattern, and after opening it can be placed with two small photo round pendants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pendant was worn for twenty-five years. The first side was her bust when she was young, and there was a stretched face next to her. The man who rose slightly, the two stood very close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second photo is a baby in the squat, which was taken when he was one year old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two photos are already yellow, and they are faded and chapped. She has been trying to save them. It is very precious for her. thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; represents her in the past! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the finger could already feel the higher and higher temperature, she threw a cigarette in her hand to the ground and re-closed the pendant Go back to the neck. Looking at some dark sky, hands in his pockets began to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
