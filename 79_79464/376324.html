			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Graf, I want to know what you are going to do, here is the station, as long as you are still here for a day, you have to abide by the agreement between us, Your work is done!" Mr. Klein loosened the bow tie and placed a cup of coffee in front of Graf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Klein found that Graf’s performance plummeted, less than a third of the previous one, even when the afternoon was the busiest. The phenomenon of completion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that no capitalist can't tolerate. Giving you money means you have to work hard, not to be a charity. Every day, the station gives these workers enough food and almost enough rest time, and can take a few days off every month, of course, when the work is not busy. Mr. Klien feels that he has been patient and competent in dealing with the garbage of these underlying societies. They should cry and be grateful to Dade for their power to give them life, not to think that the miners are lazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not Graf’s prestige and status at the station, maybe Mr. Krien will use some of the regulations in the contract to punish this damn Guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf lifted the coffee cup with a blank face, and drank it like a cow drink. At the end, put down the cup, lick it, say a sentence. When Mr. Ryan almost jumped up, "This thing is really bitter, just like the bottom of a burnt pot with water and stirring, even the color is like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thirty dollars a pound from the sun-colored coffee beans unique to the southern part of the empire to the guy's mouth is actually like a burnt pot bottom water? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Klein frowned and hid the rudeness in his heart, the rough countryman was always a rough countryman, even though they now live In the city, we can't get rid of the stupidity and ignorance of the country people. I think that the displeasure in Mr. Klein's heart has disappeared a lot. The Graf in front of him is like the gorilla he saw when he accompanied the children to the zoo. The superiority from the species itself was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I discuss coffee with a gorilla? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even chuckled, full of contempt and disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the table and sat in a comfortable seat, and tasted a bitter, fragrant coffee with a bitter taste. The bitterness at the entrance quickly turned into a warmth that seemed to be in the sun, and the long aftertaste Every cell seems to stretch out, breathing freely, greedily eager for the sun and the next. He nodded with satisfaction, and the thirty-one-pound coffee was so fascinating that people were immersed in the beauty without knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed with a heavy heart and said: "Grav, I know that you have a multi-month contract expires, but you have to understand, even if You will be free tomorrow, but today you are still a station employee. You can't ignore our work system, and you will become a bad role model for others. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf nodded his head and walked to the coffee pot with his coffee cup, hesitated, and then chose a bigger cup - a square cup for drinking, then a coffee pot The coffee was poured in. "I understand Mr., don't worry, I will work according to the rules and regulations, and I won't be a miner next time.", I looked at the "coffee" of the coffee maker and poured it into the square cup. He lifted his face and sniffed it, and drank it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s still so bitter, and you can’t quench your thirst. I really don’t know why anyone likes to drink this thing!” He lifted the square cup that had been dried, ignoring grams. Mr. Ryan has already been a red company. "Thank you for your hospitality. If there is nothing else, I will go to work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the filming ass Leaving Mr. Klein's office and looking at the empty coffee pot, Mr. Klien swung his hands and fingers down on the table and he was already mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Klien is in trouble for you?" As soon as he saw Graf coming out of Mr. Klein's office, Doolin immediately greeted him. During this time they have blended a variety of berry juices into the distilled high-alcohol, and after repeated trials, they finally decided on two flavors. One is the fruit pulp of the thorn fruit. The thorn fruit is a very cheap and common wild fruit. It is almost everywhere in the wasteland of the countryside and the countryside. It is not picky and grows rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fruit of the thorn fruit is only the size of the thumb branch, the earth is yellow, and there are black spots on the skin. This kind of fruit has a sour taste and tastes very bad. Except for occasional people who claim to be psychics will use this fruit to refine some inexplicable things, almost no one wants to eat this thing, even the poor. Not very willing to eat this thing as fruit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the fruit pulp of the thorn fruit and the "original wine" were mixed together, the reaction produced definitely exceeded Du Lin's expectations. Alcohol seems to neutralize the taste of the mouthwash, leaving only a touch of sourness. This sour taste is different from the sourness left after the fermentation of the wine. It is a light acid with a scent. Adding to the taste of the wine itself and the bitter bitterness, it forms a special taste that is different from any of the fruit wines that can be seen on the market. It is unforgettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another fruit is a snow elf from the northern part of the empire. The price is slightly higher. It takes thirty-five points to get a pound. This fruit is very sweet. According to Doolin's revelation in the dream, the higher the sugar in the cold, the more difficult it is to freeze the liquid. This is a way for plants to protect themselves, such as maple syrup. The snow elf with fruity sweetness can neutralize the bitterness of the "original wine" and make the wine taste sweeter, while at the same time creating a special taste - from spicy to cold, it is like Just crossed the volcano and entered the ice cave. The special taste made Du Lin confident in it and should be able to win the favor of many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graft’s smile a few times. “He told me not to do anything without it, as for nothing else.” He said about him. It became a bit sloppy. "We are working together. Why do he only find me trouble, not trouble you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged, "may Is it because my sense of existence is not strong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That means you are all the same at the station?", Graf feels more comfortable after he finishes. I don't know why I always feel what is wrong. "We have already made two boxes. Do you want to sell them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two boxes of twenty Four bottles of already filled high-alcohol were hidden under the bed in their rental room, which was their harvest during this time. A box of "first love" is the kind of sour high-fruit wine, a box of "snow elves". According to Du Lin, the prices of these two kinds of wines are the same. Du Lin’s psychological price is 10 yuan a bottle, and a bottle is about 1.4 pints, about seven hundred and fifty milliliters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost price included is between two and five or three. If you sell it for ten dollars, the profit should be between six and seven. between. When Dooling figured out the profit, Graf's eyes became red. God testified that he never thought that the profit of selling high-alcohol would be so high! A box of twelve bottles has a net profit of almost 80 yuan. According to his calculation of 40%, a box is sold, he can get 30 yuan, two boxes... Hey fingers, sixty dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
