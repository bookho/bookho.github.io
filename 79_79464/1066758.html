			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is an art, you don't need to have those senseless shame at this time. Know Gritch's 'God' prototype It was the prince's three princesses at the time, and Ortosif's 'natural' reference was even the empress queen. You are not involved in unscrupulous performances, but great artistic performances. At this time we need to throw away All the secular ideas are devoted to the dedication to art!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oracle is the most outstanding work of the famous sculptor Ge Lisi One has been treasured by the royal family. At that time, Grieth had become famous as the greatest master of sculpture in the empire, but he always felt that he still had regrets in his career. Until then, none of his works had completely shaken his heart, making him feel like he was facing Sacred as shocking. In a coincidence, he became the artistic tutor of the royal family, and saw the thirteen-year-old imperial princess, Xi Lizhen, and then, under his persuasion, he completed the greatest human sculpture in his life— - Gods. Perhaps it was because he felt that his life had been completed, so he jumped from the bell tower of the Imperial City at the age of fifty-nine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Ortosif is a master of painting. He was known as the youngest when he was 37 years old. Master of oil painting. At that time, the imperial emperor was only married for four years. He wanted to leave a portrait of his youth when he was on the gallery of the Royal Art Gallery. He then called Altosif into the palace to paint for himself. After the painting, the emperor was very happy, invited a lot of nobles to appreciate his portrait, and drank too much that night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he got up the next day, he accidentally discovered his own portrait, and his wife, the portrait of the imperial queen, he felt deeply Ortosiv's exquisite painting skills and asked him to paint a portrait of God, but Ortosif did not see God himself, so the emperor sent him to heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the studio, Jeff used these two examples to inspire those young actors, which is good intentions. The girl inspired by him is only in his twenties. He has been in Irian for half a year. In the past six months, she has been interviewed by many film companies, and she has also been registered by the actor union. However, she has not found any good role in the semi-annual period except for the performance of two extras who have no lines. In fact, it is normal to think about it. The beautiful girls in the empire have come to Irian as long as they have the ability. It is really difficult to find out in countless beautiful girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the dream of becoming a star, I came to Ilyan alone, but I did not hesitate to break with my family. But after I came here, she discovered that Irian was not chasing the dream of the heavens. It was hell, it was tearing the dream. And the ruthless hell of pursuing. It doesn't matter, there are no connections, no money, no one will use her. She later went to several small film companies to interview, but those people are more concerned about how to sleep her than to let her play a movie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being slept a few times and still not getting any chance, the girl decided to leave here and leave this sad place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s a coincidence that when she was about to leave Irian, she was seen by the scouts of San Fernando’s boutique film studio and recommended here. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of San Fernando comes from Jeff’s grandmother, who surnamed this before she married Jeff’s grandfather, because Jeff’s grandfather did not allow Jeff. Using their family name as the company's name to shoot things that are not something, so in the end Jeff chose the grandmother's last name, registered the company as "San Fernando Boutique Film and Television Production Company", engaged in tape recording, infusion, Transportation and sales industries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the financial statistics of the first half of this year, Jeff’s company produced a total of 71 films in the first half of the first half of the year, and the total sales volume was completed. Ten million copies of the sales plan and spillovers, the most popular of the "Daddy's Little Wildcats" sold for 800,000 copies, if not the Nasa's Empire Star and the Star Empire in front of it This tape will be able to reach the monthly sales list. To this end, Jeff also encouraged everyone to try to shoot a tape that surpassed the two-star company, and strive to push the highest sales volume of the single disk to more than 1.2 million copies! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl was scared when she was brought here, but Jeff said something to her and made her feel why she didn't try it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff’s persuasive skills are very loose, but he will use the facts to impress people, for example, the movie’s heroine is in the big production that will be released this year. Fernando's signing actor. Her dedication and performance level reached the level of mainstream movies, and Jeff did not mind investing 100,000 pieces to let her play the leading role. Of course, the words can't be said too straightforward. In Jeff's description, the rising female star used her own efforts to let the national audience remember her, and then she used the strength to convince the producers and eventually took them. Go to the heroine's play code. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, how inspirational, and Jeff said that the company will transform, and when it is firmly rooted, it will be transformed into a normalized production company to film those mainstream films. At this time, joining the company is very appropriate. After the transformation, it is directly the top signing actor. At the beginning, you can play the role of the heroine and complete the gorgeous transformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final girl decided to stay, although she couldn’t open it at the time of shooting, but after Jeff’s persuasion she thought it really was. This is not a shameful thing. The Lord of Heaven gives the wonderful organs of mankind just to let people use them. Then, since they are the will of God, what shame or shame is there? The girl bit her teeth and loosened her hands, and the bath towel fell to the ground. The record could not help but whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff glared at him and pointed at him. "The next time, you can go to the property to get more than a month's salary and give me away." Do you understand?" He looked at other staff members. "This is art. I need you to treat your work with a holy attitude. I don't want my company to be a place to hide!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reprimanded the game and made the girl feel better. After all, it seems that the people here are very professional, and... she bites With a bite, this is the opportunity, the last chance. She wants to appear on the screen, she wants to be sought after by people, she wants to go in and out, there are reporters to brighten the spotlight for her, she wants the modern life of the drunken, the opportunity is here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A forty minutes of tape, the recording time may be twice, three times or even more than forty minutes, and the busy afternoon is finally finished. The last actor led two hundred million soldiers who would kill the girl and ended all the shooting work. Jeff breathed a sigh of relief. He is very optimistic about the girl, his face is beautiful, he has a blond hair, his skin is also good, his body is also very good, the most important thing is that she has a stubborn spirit and a shy temperament, which is to attract people to save money. Ordering magic weapons, especially those older viewers, like this type. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he did not lie, the company must be transformed, and now because the tape market does not have a relevant regulatory system to manage, so you can shoot these things Earn fast money, once the empire does not allow them to do so, they must find a new way to survive, filming is obviously the most appropriate and most familiar choice. Now Jeff has let the young directors add more plots to the monotonous content, not just taking a bed or a carpet, adding more scenes, more plots, more interaction between actors. It can be said that it is good intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
