			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I take a call!", the president of the Imperial Bank of the Irian area smiled apologetically, stood up and went to the desk, picked up The phone is in the ear. He didn't talk, just finished the whole call with "hmm" and "good". When he put the phone down, he went to the small sofa group of the meeting and sat down and handed Du Lin a cigarette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a super-large client with tens of millions of deposits in the imperial central bank, James, the branch president of Ilyan, really treated Du Lin on the same day. At the festival, he will also arrange a sweet female receptionist to send some gifts for Doolin, or invite him to participate in the activities organized by the bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the empire is seen as a person, then the bank is the blood vessels that are everywhere in the human body, and the rich and the money in their pockets are blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Du Lin’s bank here is considering that there may be a large amount of cash in and out of the bank, so he must go ahead with the branch here. Long James communicated. The imperial central bank has been implementing the margin system. The Irian region is considered a developed region, between the first-tier cities and the second-tier cities. According to the central bank, it is also the secondary bank. The cash and margin deposits in the bank must be equal to 50% of the total amount saved by the depositors in the Irian area on the settlement date, which may be about 50 million. It may be a little more, maybe a little less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why it is not 100% is because the central bank has the ability and confidence to suppress the large depositors and persuade them to abandon the idea of ​​hurting each other’s feelings. The other "individuals" can't shake the deposit of the secondary bank even if they add up. This system has not been used for hundreds of years, so it is still a bit old-fashioned. Of course, in order to face some of the problems that may arise, the Imperial Bank has also enacted another set of rules, that is, the entry of large amounts must be communicated in advance. Whether it is saving or taking out, you must first say hello to the bank, especially to take it out. If there is no advance notice, the bank has the right to refuse the depositors to take the deposits in the bank, even if the money does not belong to the bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When James heard that Du Lin might have a big move lately, he complained a little inside. If the money does not return to the end, then his year-end performance will not be too good, because he let the bank "loss" tens of millions of cash. Yes, it is loss, nothing else. The money stored by the depositors in the bank is not in the bank as they say, but is used by the bank for investment or loans. Suddenly, 10 million is taken out, which means that some time in a certain place. There is a project with a budget of about 10 million yuan to be put on hold, and the bank will lose a foreseeable "profit". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there is a loss, then someone must be responsible for it, and this responsible person is James. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can ask, where is your money going to be used?", James took the initiative to ask the secretary to cut two apples for them and cut them into petals. He pushed the fruit plate to the place near Doolin, and the smile on his face squeezed out a wrinkle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the money goes to the imperial central bank in other regions, his responsibility will be lighter, at most a verbal criticism, he needs to figure out the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not have any concealment, and said it directly, "I intend to increase investment in cinema construction, I think you should have heard of it." Recently, the news has been circulated.", said that Du Lin looked arrogant and arrogant. "My contact with the George family seems to be quite smooth, in order to gain more benefits, so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing James has heard that the trust companies in any field are the most respected customers of the Imperial Bank. If Du Lin can really do this, then the head office is very likely to Doolin's customer level privilege is raised to the highest. The customer's rating is not announced, only some people inside the bank know that if Doolin's customer rating can mention the highest, it means that in the future he does not need any collateral, you can take tens of millions from the bank. loan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on James’ face is even more sunny. He even asked very intimately, “Do you need a loan? For a good customer like you, we Will provide a large amount of low-interest loans, I think this will help you build your merits on the 'battlefield'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head, he took The toothpick puts an apple flap into his mouth. "When I feel that I am not enough, I will definitely inform you." He said that he took a patted leg and stood up and took his own cap from the hanger. "Well, I should also leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I send you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Standing at the bank's door, watching Du Lin's car disappeared on the street, he took a sigh of cold air, lifted his watch and looked at the time. He didn't go back to the bank's office, but drove straight. A slightly remote barbecue in the third district. This barbecue restaurant called Demari is a little famous. Anyone who likes to eat beef knows this store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the main object of this store is never rich, and the burdock is not the most suitable place for barbecue, so their reception is for the middle and lower class. Perhaps the owner of this store, like many shopkeepers, thought about their products and mainstream consumers before opening the store, but there were always unforeseen accidents during the operation, such as roast sirloin. It is very popular in Ilyan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to cater to the market, the owner of the Demari Dallas has expanded the store and stamped the second floor to entertain guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a compartment on the second floor, James found Juan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan is playing with the beef on the plate. These burdocks have a lot of tendons. People don’t like this kind of things, let alone after the barbecue. These tendons are more difficult to chew. If this kind of thing is placed in the south or the north, it is definitely something that the poor eat. In Irian, most people love it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This damn weather!" James, who had just gotten out of the car, couldn’t stand the sweltering environment in the room. He touched the wall and didn’t imagine it. So cold, I couldn’t help but complain. "Next time you have to change places, it’s only suitable for winter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan smiled, didn’t say anything, he Pointing to the opposite chair for James to sit down, the two quickly put their energy into the hot calf. These beef can only be eaten when it is hot. It is like eating a bit of a tire when it is a little cold. After fighting for a while, the two men will kill the six-pound calf, and the satisfied one will take a sip of tea. The whole person will become Satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James and Juan are old acquaintances, there is no strangeness and sense of distance, James asked as he licked his teeth. "Things are also eaten, and tea is also drunk." Now, I can know that you have called me here. Is there anything I have to say to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan did not cover up and said directly "I want a loan!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Loan?", the little gestures in James’s hands stopped, he looked at Juan with some surprise, and asked each other Is it sick? Juan now has more than four million dollars in the bank, he actually wants a loan? This means that he does not need three or five hundred thousand or one or two million, but more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, if someone says that they want a loan and the amount is huge, then James should be happy. For example, he took the initiative to talk to Du Lin about this, but Juan said that he is not so happy to borrow, because they are friends for many years, he knows The risks inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Juan is overdue for even a second, ownership of all his collateral will be transferred, which means he sold his property at a relatively low price. bank. For a customer like Juan, the bank will give him 80% of the price of the collateral. In fact, 80% of this price will shrink, and at most it will be only 75%. If it is almost the same, it will be 5%. Seventy-two, this is the rules of the bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worth a hundred dollars? After the general evaluation of the bank, the price will not exceed 92 yuan, and then the price will be 80%. That is more than seventy-three. But if Juan wants to redeem these industries, he has to pay at least 90 to a hundred or so, and even he will not get back. Many people are unable to redeem their own things when they make huge loans. Not all investment projects can be quickly realized under the rolling of huge interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a gamble, gambling a future with your own property! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, James shook his head and said: "I donate money to others, but I don't want to push people but take the initiative to find me... Well, you want How much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hua’s keen capture of the meaning of what James said, he knows that James’s push loan is definitely not hundreds of thousands. The kind of microloan that can be compared with him is definitely an astonishing number. He can't help but ask: "Who are you talking about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp James hesitated, but decided to disclose it to Juan, because this matter is also related to Juan. "It’s Du Lin. When you call, he is communicating with me about the intention to withdraw money. I try to give him He promoted the loan business, but he refused."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I know how much he will take this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James shook his head. "I told you that this has violated the bank’s rules, so..." He shrugged. "It’s just a very amazing number."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan fell into silence, of course he knew why Dulin suddenly To take out all the deposits, because the George family is loose, it is said that some people will come to discuss the cooperation with them soon, and by the way, they will also check the theaters they own. There will be no fools in this world. You said that you have more than one hundred cinemas in your hand to believe? The more important things are, the more rigorous the review is in all aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
