			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are all forced out, all that we might think would be our own, in the face of extreme despair and extreme hope, nothing is human Can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark was quickly brought into the role of the real head, he first let the Ministry of Justice prosecute those newspapers that violated the agreement, especially Candela Those newspapers in the state. At the same time, other newspapers with no movements were invited to the Imperial Capital to join a revolution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Canas has proposed a union-like organization called the "Public Union", it is already difficult to press this shot at this time. . If John is not in a coma, if there is no attempt by Arthur and those uncles to try to divide the interests of the family, if there is no behind-the-scenes black hand pushing this, this is not a must. But the situation facing Mark has met all the requirements, so he can only do so. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of letting the small newspapers engage in a newspaper industry to use the George family as a target and goal, it’s better than Mark personally picking up the newspaper league, he is the chairman This is actually not much changed before. Others want to get the press release of the special publication, yes, paid. It’s not a buy, it’s paid. After all, interviewing a news and writing a press release that conforms to social values ​​and people’s favorite needs time, human and material resources, wants, and pays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy, and paid is actually a meaning, but it will be much better to pay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, a new category will be added, that is, exchange. In fact, Mark has already had such an idea. The Secret Society is indeed very powerful. In addition to hundreds of journalists and writers on the Imperial side, there are thousands of expatriate journalists looking for news everywhere in the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many things happening in the world every day. There are so many and many things. It is impossible for the reporters of the special publications to be exhausted. There will definitely be some omissions. Then, using the press release of the special publication company in exchange for the missing press releases in other regions has a great effect on improving the authority and coverage of the special publications. At the same time, the exchange of news is not a money exchange, but also allows more newspapers to accept this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he stabilizes the chairman of the newspaper industry and restores the feature society as soon as possible, the glory of the George family will not be lost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an industry monopoly giant starts to exert its strength, people can see why the giants are daunting. A letter of lawyer's letter and the court's summons flew to Cannes as snowflakes, and a large number of invitations appeared in front of almost all newspaper presidents. In the face of this sudden "attack", Mark grew up. A lot, and mature a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no Arthur, he may be happier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The father looks like it won't work." Arthur wore a white shirt with a pink shirt and a pair of rhino leather white shoes. Of course, there were also two. The rhinoceros horn represents the "luxury". He sat on the sofa, his blond hair curled up from the top, with a purple sunglasses covering half of his face, and it looked no different from those popular movie stars. While holding a nail clipper and picking up the nails and scratching the dust that did not exist in the West, he said with a sigh: "My father is so old, this time it is very difficult to come over and may return to the embrace of God at any time."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t seem to care too much about how badly these words are. The long-term cold-war relationship between father and son and the brainwashing of uncles and uncles, the feelings of Arthur and John are almost have nothing left. What he maintained was only the father and son on the surface. When Arthur heard that Mr. John was unconscious, he was normally surprised for a moment, and then his face showed a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old guy is not dead, how can he get his own one? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting for the old man to give him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe he gave Mark, to Nasha, he would not give it to him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the uncle is right, some things can be pretending to be invisible, for example, Mark is now in charge of the whole family. But there are things that not only need to be seen, but also to fight, such as the right that belongs to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark's face is very ugly, the outside things have made him burnt, I didn't expect Arthur to suddenly jump out at this time, but also say something like this, how could it be He is not angry? He just snorted and looked down at the documents on the table, not at all like the guy in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark does not want to care about Arthur, but Arthur will not let go of Mark. "I know that the situation of the family is a bit special now, and those inferiors are trying to challenge our position." So, in order to avoid sudden accidents, have we carried out the procedure of the will first, and then consistently external?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words in front of Arthur are very arrogant. Although they are very ugly, they are not unreasonable. Mr. John was so unconscious when he was so old. Even the doctors felt that his chances of recovery were not great. When he left the world, he completely understood the meaning of God, so he could not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the following sentence is too much, because Mr. John is still alive and enters the will process in advance. Isn’t it cursing that Mr. John can’t wake up and die? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark’s heavy table, slammed the two pens on the table, and Arthur was scared and stunned. “You listen. Listening to what you are saying is what one should say? Are you expecting your father to die? I tell you that as long as your father is not dead, your plan to split the family will not be completed in one day. This is what I said!" Mark gasped and pointed at the door of the office. "Roll, get out, don't let me see you again, this disgusting face!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean by people? Actually let your brother get out of your room?" Arthur put a beautiful nail clipper into the pocket of his shirt. He smiled and took off his glasses. A handsome face. He seems to be much smaller than Mark, either because of makeup or because of maintenance. His days are much more happy than Mark. Changing a female partner every week, never having to worry about business matters, can get millions of shares every year, so it may make him look younger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took sunglasses in his hand, replaced his finger with a sunglasses and pointed at Mark, and poked a few times far away. "I see you can arrogantly When, you are as disgusting as your mother!", after he turned around, he walked out of the room, leaving only the red-eyed mark, clenching his fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Mark’s office, Arthur quickly found a lawyer who has been serving Mr. John, one of the shareholders of Virtue Law Firm, specializing in serving the George family. It has been more than twenty years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Mark, the lawyer did not show any disgusting emotions, he is a real "worker", will not put personal feelings, or someone else's private Feelings are brought into the attitude of working. He took the initiative to pull out a chair for Arthur and poured coffee. "Is there anything I need to help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur took a breath and took off The sunglasses were thrown on the table. "The old man may not be able to wake up. Can we finish the will process in advance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer's eyebrows picked him up. He shook his head and sat across from Arthur, and he explained the legal common sense related to the will and the estate. After the death of the party, after the court has verified it, the procedure can be started. Otherwise, the division of the property will be prohibited by the court. Therefore, even if Mr. John will always be comatose to death, as long as he does not go to see God, his property and money, others will not want to get a hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no other way?", Arthur was a little annoyed, and the people outside were plotting the family of the George family. The old man was unconscious and might see the old man. Before God, Arthur’s money would become something else. If there is no such thing, no one will jump out to challenge the status of the George family, and he will not be so anxious, after all, the things on the face should be maintained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can think of so much, it’s not what Mark guessed, it’s not Arthur’s agitation by Arthur, but Arthur’s outside last night. When I was entertaining, I met a rich man who reminded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the manor back to his villa, Arthur was indignant, these people are against him, it is simply abominable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around irritably, suddenly thought of something, made a phone call, dialed a number, "Joe? Come out at night, I treat, I have something to say to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, all the Buddha’s clothes in the bells and whistles are like a gold medalist walking into an entertainment venue, immediately nasal There are all kinds of perfumes in it. These technical women are not much different from what they were hundreds of years ago. They still like to use perfume to cover up the special taste of them. He didn't like it, but he had to appear here again because Du Lin arranged a task for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls are passionately surrounded by the Buddha, so that some of the guests frequently look at them, in fact, can not blame these girls. Money is a good thing, but when you sell your own technology, if the other person is a handsome young man like Dudu, it is better than those middle-aged men who are not much better than wild boar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the girls, Buddha entered the most upscale private room, and Arthur was already inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You go out first, we have something to say." Arthur glanced, the girls left the room with some disappointment, and the room suddenly quieted down. He waved his beckon and patted the sofa around him. "Come and sit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
