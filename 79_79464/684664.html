			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although people’s views on the police are not very good, the murder police still let many of the hearing members stand up in shock, even among the jury members. Two members stood up. They dare not look at Du Lin sitting in the dock and the "backbone" around him. They can't believe their eyes and ears. These few beautiful guys can still be regarded as young people. Murder the police? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock of people is that the police represent the deterrent and authority of the empire in the people, even if there are many scums in the police. This kind of behavior is simply to provoke the authority of the empire, breaking people's fear and mystery about the empire and the ruling class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleepy judge also regained his sitting position, his eagle-like gaze continually glanced back and forth between Doolin and Dufo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Mr. 3,000 suddenly stood up, and his reaction was very quick, although he was equally shocked by this allegation that he was not in the file at all. He quickly reacted from the shock. He raised his hand and shouted loudly. "Mr. Judge, I am against the district prosecutor’s allegations against Mr. Doolin. This is shameless filth and jealousy! And this allegation is Not in the case file, it should not be tried together with this case!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge shook his head. "I think that as an allegation that Du Lin is suspected of organizing a criminal group and committing a crime." During the complaint, any newly added evidence and witnesses and allegations should be treated as a whole. If your objection is invalid, the prosecutor can continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prosecutor showed a smug smile and quickly converges. He took the sword and took a very angry look to the witness side and asked: "Do you know Mr. Doolin? If you know, please indicate who Mr. Doolin is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tramp has been dressed up for today’s attendance, and it can be seen that his new suit is removed from the store’s shopping rack and will not be worn on him. Six hours. The washed hair naturally rose and covered most of his appearance. He pressed the hair in front of him to his ear. Some of them cramped the dock. After watching it for a while, he shook his head. "I don't know Mr. Doolin. I don't know if he is not present today." The prosecutor nodded with satisfaction and the witness swears to God before the hearing and reads out that he is willing to bear all the consequences of the perjury. This testimony is Have a certain credibility. He looked to the judge and stated: "The witness does not know Mr. Doolin, so there is no conflict of interest between the witness and Mr. Doolin." The judge also nodded. The prosecutor continued to ask: "So can you Everything you saw that night, the original book was written."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tramp's narrative is very simple, and the homeless tramp that is like him is almost the same every day. Three meals a day are all looking for from the garbage dump. The main job is to earn their own living expenses through begging. Most of the time they use their property for women who are drunk and looking for cheap and skilled women. That night, the tramp was just awake from the drunken dream. After he was drained from the garbage bin inside the lane, he was uncomfortable and squatted on the trash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical problems of tramps have always been serious, irregular diets and contaminated foods are the main cause of their physical discomfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the hustle and bustle, he saw two trucks passing by the alley. As a tramp living in this area for a long time, he knew the delivery of the night. Often they all have a personal relationship. He is curious to see who is in the business and what is being smuggled. He didn't dare to go out. Even if a tramp like him died in an alley, no one would ask him for justice, so he would shrink into the shadow of the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scent of the nose sent him a little faint excitement, and even more exciting for him was the appearance of two patrolmen, the shadow of his hiding in the alley in. Sometimes the patrolman and these smugglers will have some minor contradictions. These small contradictions come from the question of "an easy fee". Maybe they can steal a box of wine when they are quarreling. The desire for alcohol made him bravely overcome the inner timidity, and then he watched a policeman not go down after he got on the truck, and another policeman was sent under the help of several people. truck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the truck left, he took his breath and walked out of the alley, went to the place where the police station was standing, then knelt down and touched the ground with his fingers. Red liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; viscous, delicate, with a slight sticky feeling, his pupil is instantly enlarged, he knows that this is blood, he often gets used for a variety of reasons Some wounds, so he can be sure that it is blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two policemen were killed by the group! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wandering of this, the wanderer madly runs all the homes worth almost two dollars in the alley, madly marching toward the truck The opposite direction runs all the way. In the process of escaping, he accidentally bumped into a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big man who came down from the truck, he also knew, Graf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple narratives make the story not too legendary, but precisely because of this narrative without any refinement, it adds realism and more Shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecutor nodded with satisfaction and then conveyed a document to the judge and Mr. Three thousand, who raised the documents in his hand and said "There are three things recorded in this document. The first thing is the archival record of the Tenel Regional Police Department. The two police officers who patrolled that night night were missing. The second thing is the police family. The alarms were basically the same. The men in the house disappeared after a night shift, and there was a reply from the police station. The third thing, we found two metal alarms at the Lost Center of the garbage disposal station, which can prove It happened to be the siren of two missing police officers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the above evidence and the testimony of the witnesses, I believe that the criminal group headed by Doolin is in the process of smuggling. In the middle of the night, I met a night patrol policeman. After their evil activities were discovered, they rushed to kill people and dealt with the body objects and the body objects on the body. My speech is over, thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. , But did not reveal the look of despair, he turned around and whispered Turin and Dover exchange a few words, write or draw on paper, then stood up. He walked to the witness stand and started the hearing with the permission of the judge. "This... Mr. Tramp, you said that you met one of my clients, Mr. Foshan, in the process of fleeing the crime scene. Is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tramp nodded, “I met him!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 Mr. Qiang continued to ask, "You just swear to God and are willing to bear the consequences of all the perjury. You now confirm that everything you just said is true. Have you not modified or modified your testimony under the guidance of others?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecutor heard this sentence and realized that the testimony of the tramp might have a problem. He raised his hand and shouted against it, but the judge dismissed it. His request, "The question raised by the defendant's lawyer is in full compliance with the rules of this trial, and the objection is invalid. The defendant's lawyer can continue to ask questions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanderer Wipe the fine sweat on the forehead and confirm the reliability and authenticity of his testimony. After giving a nod to the judge, Mr. Sanqian left the witness stand and said to the jury, pointing out loudly by the tramp, "He lied!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
