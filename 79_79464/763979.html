			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown is very clear, as long as he leaves the crew, in the film circle he is equal to making friends with failure. In the future, when producers and investors choose a cooperative actor, they tend to avoid him as easily "injured", and his status will be greatly threatened. Can be kicked out by the "first" color film crew, no matter how reliable he is, people will only doubt whether he has done something that should not be done, or because of personal arrogance Investors, so they will be kicked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people are waiting to see his jokes, and some people will take the initiative to stand up and down the stone. The film circle is small, but it is very complicated. The actors standing at the top of the pyramid are very honorable, but the actors who are stepping on their feet are staring at them all the time. As long as they find that the opportunity has come, they will try their best to get him down and become a stepping stone for others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t go and can’t afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Corinna’s indifference, Brown’s heart continued to sink. At this time, he couldn't fully notice the feeling that he could hurt him. In his whole world, only Corinna was alone. His concern was also on Corinna's attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on his face shook up, revealing an expression that would make him look dangerous, stiff and with a pleading, "科科, We can use avatars, don't shoot my legs, the film technology is very developed, magical makeup is enough for many people to find out that I am using a stuntman. I don't want to ask for this word, but now I beg you, don't hurry I am leaving!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corlina came to his side and reached out to his cheeks. Brown took the initiative to be a dog looking forward to the director’s caress. The active face came together and touched the face to give off the slippery sweat because of the pain. Corinna’s indifferent eyes never changed. She shook her head. “I am sorry, Brown, I have to make this decision. You know, I can't afford to lose, you too..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment Corinna’s time became extremely slow, she could feel herself The body's uncontrollable slow rush to Brown's body, the director's frightened face Whole lost usual color, the same producer as a bitch frightened to hold fast to his shoulder opened his mouth slowly, visible noise from his throat lowest surface spewing out. This moment is extremely weird, the side of the carriage slowly twists inward, raised, and Brown underneath struggles wildly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor around me slammed in the opposite direction, and the body slowly sinked in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the time returned to the normal state, a huge impact sound came from the ear and the humming sound of the tire and the ground. Corinna flew directly and slammed into the protruding compartment, then slammed back to the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before she fell into a coma, she faintly heard the scream of "a car accident" coming from outside the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for her is the infinite darkness, she is not afraid of the darkness, but she is afraid of a car accident, the car accident will not necessarily take her life, but the car accident will take away Everything about her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A drunken young man jumped from the cab of a truck panicked, and his twisted pace almost made him fall. He drunk and ran to the back of the ambulance's compartment to open the door, and the whole person was soft on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A car accident occurred. The apparently drunk driver drove a truck at the crossroads and hit the body of an ambulance. The ambulance was taken by him. The truck is launched more than ten meters away. If there are not many people in the ambulance, and the truck brakes as much as possible, this is likely to be a tragedy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two ambulances and police cars in the police station. Young people were taken to the police car and waiting for him could be a very serious accusation. As for the six wounded people who were lifted on the ambulance, they quickly left the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowds on the crowd did not disperse and still discuss the matter on the roadside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So I propose that for Ilyan's tomorrow to be better, in order to stop this situation, we should set up the Transportation Bureau!", on the second day At the town hall meeting, the mayor’s voice was a bit high. He forced the newspaper to fall on the table. It was just a photo of the scene of the accident. "If there is a traffic signal or even a trafficman’s command, there will be no such accident. Irian will inevitably become an international metropolis. We should go to the forefront of the times and accept everything that is helpful to us, instead of being self-sufficient!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I know that some of you have some opinions on the establishment of the Transportation Bureau, but it is not important. I have already made a decision. You can keep your own objections, but absolutely do not allow any incumbents to have such an idea. Now some people think If you want to object, I will accept your thoughts and opinions!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the silent meeting room, the mayor’s brow was loose, and he sat down again, and he had a smile on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Transportation seems to have no influence on the lives of these officials, but there are still some problems in the actual operation, such as the most opposed police chief . Once the Transportation Bureau is established, all cases related to violations of the vehicle will be stripped from the police station. This is equivalent to reducing the scope of the police station. Can the police chief be willing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the officials who have their own cars, their cars will be numbered, so that one can recognize which one is their car at a glance. Their travel and consumption will be bothered. To know that Irian is a tourist city, there are countless entertainment projects in the city. In the past, they were able to drive into a number of places without their own imprints, but now don't say that they have some places to go. Some people will point at them when they just leave the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And traffic lights and commanders will also deprive them of the privilege of driving, they will, like ordinary people, obey the traffic rules and obey the civilians. The conductor's command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things may not be too damaging to them, but they can be disgusting to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A timely car accident made them bow their heads. If it was just an ordinary car accident, it was not enough to do so. The problem was that the ambulance was actually the main group of the Ilyan holiday. member. From the situation we have learned, it is very pessimistic. The heroine Corinna has more fractures and it takes half a year to fully recover. The director's head hit the carriage and was still in a coma. The producer was slightly better and the clavicle was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that can be said to be unscathed is the Brown that is fixed on the stretcher, and he becomes the lightest one. After the entire crew lost these key personnel, they have already been scrapped. Don’t say that they can't wait for three months and three months. Seeing that Ilyan’s holiday had been ruined, the first color film became a past tense, and the mayor announced the second thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our Mr. 350,000 will film the first colored film to promote Irian, focusing on the city and culture of Irian, this movie The importance of Irian I think I don't need to explain it to you, you are also very clear. Scott will be responsible for coordinating the problem during the shooting, I have no other requirements, the only requirement is that all departments, all in need At that time, you must cooperate with the crew's shooting requirements. If you let me know who dares to reach out, who dares to block the shooting, take the initiative to hand over the letter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
