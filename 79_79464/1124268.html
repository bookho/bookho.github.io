			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people almost did not react, the war suddenly broke out and achieved remarkable results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then when people feel that the war will continue, the war is inexplicably over, but fortunately this is a victorious war, inspired by unprecedented The morale of the entire empire has enhanced cohesion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s newspaper in his hand, the front page of the newspaper reads the word “harmony”, the federal government took the initiative to decide, and decided to terminate this war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the federal government does not want to believe that it will not work. After the financial economy has suffered a devastating blow, the war potential has been exhausted by half, and now Saint-Louis is The surprise attack, the federal bank was evacuated, and a large number of financial institutions were looted. If they did not talk, it would only be able to overdraw the country's future development potential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, peace talk does not mean that the Federation does not have the ability to continue the war. In fact, if it is played at this time, it may be detrimental to the empire. In the face of the war of national dying that is about to destroy the country, the entire federal society will be turned into a war machine. People will even go to the local city hall to pick up a piece of materials and manual machinery to return home to make bullets for the army, and then hand it over to their children. The child will not hesitate to pick up the weapon and rush to the battlefield. At that time, either the federation will be destroyed or the war will be dragged into the quagmire endlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Cabinet also recognized these issues after the consultations. The difficulty of the country as a big country wanting to perish can be said to be very large, and the vast land area means With a deeper strategic depth, once the war area is opened, there will be problems in the supply line and all aspects, which will inevitably become a national war. In this case, which can be called a country of ruin, if the United States cannot truly annihilate the Federation, after the United States has slowed down, it will inevitably launch more violent retaliation, dragging both countries into the invisible war abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of betting on an uncertain possibility, it’s better to get a lot of benefits right now, and the empire’s national strength has grown because of this war. The Federation has thus begun to subside, and in a few years it may not be necessary to use the means of warfare to allow the Union to gradually die out in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the decision was made, the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs agreed to the federal government’s request for peace talks, and the two sides temporarily suspended the exchange of fire. Some people think that this is only temporary, and the war will continue. But Du Lin understands that the war is really over. This harbinger has already appeared half a month ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Keller’s frequent activities in various social situations mean that the governments on both sides are secretly communicating. Now the so-called armistice talks are actually only for ordinary people. As you can see, all the substantive exchanges of interests have basically been negotiated. The current peace talks are to show the people to see, let them know what happened, why they will stop fighting, and how much benefit we can get. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the war means that the military’s productivity will be re-released during the war, and the overall economy of the society will have a significant increase. At the same time, some contradictions will also It will inevitably be further intensified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, these are not Du Lin’s current concerns. There are only two things he has to worry about. The first thing is to donate money to donate land, the second thing. It is engagement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yes, there is one more important thing, that is to explain to Mr. Xmas, why do you want to get engaged, but the object is not the town of Zijing That one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have gone bad, Doolin." Mr. Kesma’s deep voice made Du Lin’s subtle trepidation, and he believed that as long as the old gentleman wanted and are willing to do that, he is likely to go with a stick empire from alfalfa to town, just to beat their own meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the best way to answer now is to stay silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to hear Du Lin’s voice Mr. Xerma is a little annoyed, “I thought you were a good boy, at least in my memory you have always been a Honest children, you can do what you do. You leave your son here and let us bring it. I am very handsome outside, and I am engaged to the niece of the old guy of Magus?", Mr. Xmas's tone is gradually high, which means that he is no longer restraining his temper. "You actually fell to the nobility. This is an incredible thing. My son is about to become a running dog of the nobility. This is for me. The biggest ridicule!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't do that, understand? You can marry a madman, a fool, or even a female watch, but you can't Do you understand what I said in the descendants of the nobility?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin didn't think that Mr. Kemma's reaction was so strong. He thought about it and said, "I will go back as soon as possible. Some things we need to talk face to face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Kesma paused for a while before asking in a doubtful tone, "Do you mean what we said on the phone we are using now, may be known by others?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't say it!", Du Lin sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sighed after hanging up the phone, he was on the Sigma What Mr. did in the past was clear, but in his opinion, Mr. Kemer’s approach was a bit extreme and he chose a wrong direction. Assassination of the aristocracy to create fear and social unrest can not really threaten the rule of the nobility, and release sufficient space for all ordinary people. Instead, it will lead the nobles to adopt an unprecedented high-pressure policy because of fear, and put an end to any possible signs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mr. Kesma is the father of Doolin, he also has to say that the old man chose the wrong direction, and he chose the right path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future, and the future changes, can only be changed from top to bottom before having the absolute power to sweep everything. This is the most The right path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In peacetime, it is impossible to achieve the goal of changing the ruling class through uprising or other means of force. Any individual and power are unified in the country and have long-term stability. In the case of wanting to act against the will of the people, it is impossible to be accepted by the people, and it is bound to be defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs to have a good talk with Mr. Xerma. Of course, the most important thing is to avoid Mr. Xema’s coming from time to time and running over to slap him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructed Natiya to do a good job and arrange some of the next things, and Du Lin went home with the Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two days, after a lot of bumps, Du Lin finally saw his old house, and all three cows were being A few young people chasing children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some people who can’t believe their eyes. He pointed to the little boy who was running in the middle and asked, “Is that... my son?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
