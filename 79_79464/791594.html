			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin spoke to the director, the actors were already in place. They knew that Du Lin was an investor and therefore did not urge him. Instead, he quietly waited for two people. Finished the conversation. Now the film is not doing well. Last year, the hottest movie box office exceeded 10% of the total box office in a year. More than 20 movies were not recovered, and several investors who lost money almost collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are two kinds of people in this line who are the least likely to offend, the first is the investor, and the second is the crew member who has a relationship with the investor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took the director’s shoulder and sweared. "Okay, let me know if you have time. You can't delay your precious time because of my personal affairs." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director smiled and turned and walked toward his own behavior. In fact, he still has something to say to Du Lin if the film is doing well. If Du Lin still wants to vote for a movie, can he continue to use him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of good scripts, a lot of good directors, but the investors who are willing to invest are very pitiful. If you can catch one, you must not let go! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat in the shade of the tree watching the filming, he suddenly found something in the line of sight, curiously squinted, Stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha and Chris are coming, uninvited guests! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you were kicked out by the back of them and kicked out?" Nasha turned to Du Lin’s "scar" as soon as she opened her mouth. But unfortunately, she did not see Du Lin's angry or unwilling expression, only saw the smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders. "You can't guarantee that everyone believes in you and is willing to follow you, and this is a business act. There is no betrayal in business. Words can only say that they are not satisfied with the expected profit and distribution method that I brought to them, so they chose to split up. This is normal, isn't it? At least I think so, there is nothing to regret."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha chuckled and sat casually on the chair next to Doolin. She asked Chris to have two cups of frozen tropical fruit juice, one for her, one for her. It was Chris's, and there was no Dulin's share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took a lot of juice from the fruit and fruit, and I felt some fine flesh in the juice. It tasted so good. It’s no wonder that most pedestrians on the road hold a cup. She took off the sunglasses and put it on the table, and looked at Doolin with a tempting look. "Have you ever thought about doing it yourself? I can give you this opportunity. I will talk to Uncle Arthur about this. They Maybe I will consider it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin didn’t know what Nasha had to do, he finally filled the pit and inserted a cross to let Everyone thinks that he is a poor loser. How can he drill back again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t follow a topic, but Nasha didn’t intend to let Du Lin go. “Do you really have a little regret and pity? This is a very A good opportunity, as long as I make a call, you have the opportunity to become a partner of the George family, even if you may be just a 'cutting', it is enough to get a lot of benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Du Lin looked at the filming on the set, and did not return to the head. "If you are bored and come to see me jokes, then you should be satisfied. If you want to give me something, I You can ask the bank manager for the bank card number. Or do you think I am handsome and want to support me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost let Nasha spout out, her head As soon as the juice from the mouth was spit on the ground, it coughed up sharply, and even the juice was dripping out of the nostrils. Chris immediately took out her handcuffs and cleaned Nasa's juice across her face. For a while, Nasha was breathing in the air to restore her state. She was screaming at Du Lin. Now she is full of nose and smell. "You also... don't look for a mirror to see your honor?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the juice in the nose returns to the mouth, will it have a bit of salty taste?", Doolin showed a curious look. “A lot of people say that the nose is salty!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha licked it, then stood up and rushed to the flower bed, she really It was disgusting, and the stomach sac burst into a sharp contraction, which made her sickly want to vomit. After retching for a while, she didn't come back. She went straight to the car under the help of Chris, but through her eyes when she turned back, Du Lin knew that she would come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like an episode that didn’t bother Du Lin’s leisure time. He watched it for a while and then left. He has been paying attention to the operation of Juan and Luke. In this respect, Du Lin does not have to arrange his own people, and many people are staring at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this time, Luke listened to Juan’s guidance and decided to return to the western region to start the acquisition of cinemas. In the relatively backward western movie theaters, there is really not much. It is not important to have a small number. The important thing is the market share. It is said that under the lure of Lukewei, more than a dozen cinemas have been acquired, accounting for one-third of the total number of cinemas in the western region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a situation that Du Lin did not consider before. One or two hundred cinemas said that they could not scare the George family’s delegation, but The word "line" is a bit horrible. Fortunately, although he is a monk, he will find a way to let the delegation know the specific situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two kept whales in the cinema, and the construction work almost completely stopped. What is missing now is time. They can only use money for time. There is still a week left for the delegation to Ilyan. Whether the number of cinemas in their hands can exceed 150 is still a problem. If only this level, the George family will not be willing to talk to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know that Nasha and Chris came to Irian to build twenty-four cinemas. The George family’s plan is to complete the industry by the end of this year. The integration will complete the basic figure of a thousand cinemas next year. One hundred and fifty are compared with one thousand and fifteen percent. Maybe they have the possibility of negotiation, but the partnership... still forget it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in Xie Lisi Street was a bit cheerful during this time. The most talked about is whether the stock of DreamWorks can create a new high. From the price of a piece of seven to eight, it has already caused many people to go crazy about this stock. It is like never having a top, even if there is a short sideways, it will continue to rise in a pen transaction. Some people think that this stock of DreamWorks is very likely to break through ten, and then it will enter a period of stability, and even some callbacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spread of this idea, DreamWorks’ stock trading volume has remained high, and at a point where people don’t know, this is enough Change the status quo of this stock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clark, I think we should immediately suspend DreamWorks and apply for verification of shareholder holdings!", talking about the supervisor of the Xie Lisi Street Stock Exchange Supervisory Board One of the long, he was somewhat angry and put down the documents in his hand, looking at the supervisor who he called Clark. "This is a crime! They obviously operate illegally!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he threw the documents in his hand on the table, he could clearly see that there were two copies. The first one was about the abnormal flow of DreamWorks funds. The document was from the Entrusted Management Office of the Imperial Bank's Stock Securities. DreamWorks' stocks continue to rise. Many new rich people have been created on Xie Lisi Street. These people just bought this stock with their own net worth, and then they have five times in a very short time, let them become this one. Street new darling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it is because the trend of this stock is somewhat unreasonable, and some people have raised some doubts about DreamWorks itself. To put it simply, they have created a lot of millionaires and some multi-millionaires. Doesn't that mean that the value of DreamWorks itself is not worth 100 million? No company has been able to push the stock price to this point so quickly, and the imperial central bank’s equity securities entrusted management office has carried out a less formal “search” of DreamWorks’ assets in a “responsible” attitude, and then They found that there wasn't even a penny on the public account of the registered company of DreamWorks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They immediately responded to the matter to the stock exchange supervisory board, and notified the relevant agencies, and soon these people had new discoveries, DreamWorks was suspected of exceeding The stock was issued, and the illegal operation of the shares in the hands of the shareholders was not reported to the stock market. To put it simply, the shareholders of the DreamWorks board have no stocks. All stocks are traded in legal and illegal ways, and these stocks are still circulating in the market! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This explains why this stock is constantly pulling up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commonly explain the rise and fall of stock prices is actually very easy to understand, to put it bluntly, as long as there are buying and selling behavior, the stock price will continue to fluctuate. When everyone is optimistic about a stock, they are not willing to sell the stock in hand, then the transaction will be suspended and the stock price will not change. People are saying that DreamWorks will go up and sell fewer people. The lack of trading means that it won't rise much or fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, someone suddenly wants to sell the stock in their hands, but the price is slightly higher than the current price by five cents, and those who hold the banknotes will immediately Buy, then the stock price has risen by five cents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When stock prices began to rise, those who were holding stocks were even more reluctant to sell stocks, so some "good people" began to rise higher. At the price of the stock, the stock price began to rise bit by bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
