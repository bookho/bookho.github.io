			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the TV set two years ago came out, the inventor of the TV set considered using a line similar to a telephone line to lay a network, but in the end The idea failed. The transmission and transmission of TV signals is not as simple as a telephone. It only needs electric pulses to generate sound waves to restore the sound. The TV needs more than just sound, but also pictures, constantly changing pictures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final plan was replaced by tape, and the player that bought this TV set became the only choice for the merchant. For the business, it doesn't matter what you choose. You can make money. It is not conservative. It is estimated that the official name is why the player has sold 170,000 units in the entire western region. What concept is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three thousand, 170,000 units, almost 500 million in sales, is enough to build a huge consortium out of thin air. Of course, this money can't be counted as well. The difference between gross profit and net profit is very large, sometimes as many as several times. But how to say it again, a net profit of one hundred million is definitely not less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This business seems to smell more money from it, as some far-sighted people have guessed, one day TV will enter thousands of homes Ten thousand households have become one of the common must-have "furniture" like shoe cabinets, closets, and dining tables. This will be a market that feels terrifying. Many capital predators have also poured into this market and started the battle for interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t seem to realize that when the commodity end market tends to overflow, providing services is the real big deal in the future! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are able to sell one million machines, and there will inevitably be one million users waiting for wired access! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin's next research project proposed by Stan Ein, the fidelity and decoding in the cable signal transmission process is the first. Once these two troublesome problems can be solved, with the technological monopoly, in the next ten years, Du Lin will monopolize this market. Patent barriers and technical faults will become fatal wounds for catchers. They have to invest heavily to make up for the technical gap between the two sides, and then invest 10 times or even 100 times to bypass Doolin's patent barriers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they can get around, this market has almost changed from profiteering to small profits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of cable access does not mean that the tape market will be abandoned. In fact, the profit of the tape market is still a huge gold mine that is bottomless. Du Lin vaguely remembers that in the dream, Daxie and some people talked about the topic of film and television. In the place called the United States, the income of the production company comes from the wonderful CD and the surrounding, so the tape industry will never fall. If you can’t make money, it’s not a problem in the industry, it’s a question of ability and ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the person in charge of the joint construction found Du Lin, I hope he can visit the blast of the "right wall" mountain. The right-walled mountain is the mountainous area on the east side of the city of Otis. The mountain is not high. The highest place is more than 700 meters. The shorter part is two or three hundred meters. It runs vertically in the north and south. The width is about 400 meters to 500. Around the meter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than two months of careful measurement and research, the joint construction engineer finally chose to open a hole in a place where the mountain structure is stable, and then fixed both sides. The cliff runs directly through the right-hand mountain range. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, Doolin had an idea to drill a hole and make a tunnel. The joint construction engineer then dismissed Duin’s idea. Because of the technical and construction reasons, opening a mountain cave is not infeasible, but it takes more money and time. It is not as simple as opening a mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin considered this and agreed to this request. He also invited the more prestigious investors in the city of Otis to visit the first round. Blasting, let them feel the determination and attitude of the City Hall in order to penetrate things! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When can I open the car? I hope that you can focus on the work compared to your scenes!" Du Lin walked while People who talked with the joint construction workers spoke, but they sounded tougher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person in charge of the joint construction is not annoyed, but instead nodded constantly, catering to Du Lin’s reaction, “the whole mountain development takes about three months. At the time, we will build a railway while cutting the mountain. It must be said that the construction machinery of the Empire is very easy to use, at least more than the federal use! So this can greatly save our costs, reduce working hours, up to After half a year, you can see two railroads that are open to the east and west on the map."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction machinery of the empire is all modified by the AT-1 weapon platform. These weapons-equipped platforms have been horrific war weapons in the past, capable of carrying several cannons, and can also directly install a ringing fortress on top to form a flowing defense line. A weapon-mounted platform with an added engineering robotic arm interface can handle many things that humans can't do every day. It's only a matter of time before a mountain is built. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more and more people participated, at 10:30 in the morning, a loud noise came, and the earth seemed to tremble. There was a crack in the mountain, and a large number of rocks began to slide down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Used explosives?", Du Lin recognized the fire and the more intense smoke than steam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunpowder is not non-existent, but it has been lost to twins in many ways, so the field used now is relatively narrow and it is difficult to see the gunpowder. But this does not mean that the gunpowder has no use. The explosive expansion rate of the gunpowder in the sealed space exceeds the speed of the reaction of the twins, and the force is greater, and it is mostly used in large-scale projects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person in charge nodded. "Yes, we considered using the twin blasting tube. Later, the chief engineer rejected this idea, on the one hand because of the cost, and On the one hand, it is to avoid the danger of hidden danger caused by unsuccessful blasting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twinning blasting cylinder is to process the twinning into a fine powder and then increase the concentration of the catalyst. The two sides are fully mixed together in an instant to achieve an explosion phenomenon caused by a sudden increase in pressure inside the container. However, this kind of thing sometimes happens a little accident, for example, the pressure is enough, but there is no explosion. Instead, the blasting tube is squeezed out from the firm rock mass like a shot, causing casualties of people in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason for this is that the reaction rate is slower than the gunpowder, and the pressure increase is the only way to find a breakthrough in the rock mass. The place is one after the other, no matter from the breakthrough, it will eventually become a huge trouble. It is not flying out to injure the construction workers, it is an unstable bomb that is full of great pressure and requires special machines and equipment to be dismantled, resulting in the extension of the project. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the choice of gunpowder, although the price of gunpowder is slightly higher, the reliability has greatly increased. The person in charge was a bit surprised. He did not expect Du Lin to know the gunpowder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first round of blasting ended, people in the distance suddenly felt a constant vibration coming from the foot, more parts of the mountain began to tilt, Move, collapse. With a loud bang, a huge stone rolled down the mountain, like a hammer hammering in the chest of people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment of silence, immediately applauded, a construction machine was launched, and the right-hand mountain running project officially began! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
