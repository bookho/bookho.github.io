			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surui, my female classmate!", the moment that Merlin spoke the classmate's word suddenly had a very weird feeling, like... I am also a student with classmates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s clear that Suri will not be so simple, she put her hair behind her ear, revealing half of the pink cheeks and neck, shy I patted Merlin, "is a girlfriend!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a self-styled fashionista, Su Rui saw that the price of this dress is not What she can accept is not what she can imagine. Every tailor has his own pride, especially those who are at the top of the empire's upper class. They are not great men or officials, but they are enough to call them celebrities. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; many of them for generations to make clothes for the royal party's top tailors, there are those who tailors clothes for big nobles, these people have their own pride, Therefore, they will point out the source of this dress in their own works in a way that the layman can't see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Tailor’s most famous Orne family, their family once created eight sets of emperors for the six emperors, this generation of Orne The family's heirs will embroider an almost invisible crown on the sword collar of the clothes with a color that is worse than the color of the clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone will make a fuss on the button, for example, there is a circle of platinum in the button of Doolin’s jacket, which is pressed with a blue agate pick. At the beginning of the line, the order price of this dress is about 2,000. The tailor only accepts two orders a month, but it must be a person with status and status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of Du Lin’s top-down apparel, including accessories, were designed with special attention. The specific thing is that Dove is operating, he only needs to pay. Then put on your clothes. This set of clothes has exceeded 5,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five thousand, the man who wears a good car, Suri has not seen it, but she has not seen it so close, so she performed Very humble, even humble. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Turin patted Merlin's arm, winked, "I thought you will encounter little trouble in life, but it looks like you than life I think it is much better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the three men spoke, a driver in a suit walked to the side of their side about five meters away. When they said it was almost the same, the driver went over, bent over and lowered his head. Mr. Lin, Mr. Jack knows that you are coming to Nano Lindes, so I will arrange for you to pick you up. Mr. Jack asks you to hold a small banquet, I hope you can enjoy your face."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not think that Mr. Jack would know that he had arrived at Nano Lindes. He remembered that he had not spoken to Mr. Jack, but he was not able to refuse because he was invited to him. Especially after he and the king called, there was no reason to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I saw Mr. Jack, Du Lin made a phone call with the leader of the poker organization, the king of the king, the next day. Interested, I am willing to take 30 million to participate in this plan, but the King also has a request. No matter how many times Du Lin realized the profit, he only needs ten times, and the time limit is five years. After five years, Du Lin must pay a minimum of 150 million yuan, no more than 300 million, and more Dulin's. It has nothing to do with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful and with some courage to make this deal, the money quickly broke into Doolin’s unregistered account in the bank, which also Let Du Lin look at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to call 30 million on two transactions alone, which is enough to show that Du Lin’s position in some people’s minds is quite high, not everyone’s. Credit is worth 30 million! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the two sides had a more intimate cooperation, Mr. Jack came to pick him up, and Du Lin was relieved. As one of the largest underground money launderers in the West, it is simply too simple to know what tickets a person has booked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to be together?", Du Lin looked at Merlin, and explained by the way, "Mr. Jack is my good friend, and the night should be an ordinary one." At the party, there won't be too many irrelevant people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline is considering Sulei looking forward to look at Merlin, the pleading in his eyes and face With vivid expressions, Merlin finally nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the three got on the bus, the luxury team quickly left the station at the attention of the people. Mr. Jack has a service on the side of Nam Lindes. He did not always live here. His real residence is on the emperor's side, and he controls the entire situation in the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team left the city in less than 20 minutes and entered the suburbs. Soon, it entered a beautifully renovated green road. The leafy trees on both sides of the road make this road full of mottled sunshine, giving a feeling of poetry and painting. After driving for almost five minutes, the team stopped outside a quaint old castle, where Mr. Jack lived in the Nam Lindes and was one of the real estate resources invested by the organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without getting off, Du Lin saw that Mr. Jack had led three strangers to greet them outside the gates of the castle building, even after the car stopped. Mr. Jack personally opened the door for Doolin, which is not a trivial matter. Every behavior of the upper class has been given special meaning by people, and even Du Lin did not think of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too polite!", Du Lin shook hands with Mr. Jack after he got out of the car. "This makes me a little uneasy, you won't be prepared." What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously a joke, and Mr. Jack and the gentlemen behind him both laughed, because Du Lin guessed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am coming...", Mr. Jack was just preparing to introduce the three people behind Du Lin, only to notice that two more people came down from the car, a young The handsome boy, and a sweet girl, he was a little surprised and looked at Doolin. He thought that only Du Lin was alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my brother, my brother, Merlin, that is his girlfriend, Su Rui.", Du Lin briefly introduced, no need Too many explanations, with Merlin also hope to let him grow some insights, which will be of great benefit to his future exposure to more things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jack and they greeted him before continuing to introduce to Du Lin, who leaned slightly and gave up a space to highlight the first behind him. The status of the person, this person seems to be in his fifties, silver-white hair, with a trace of perm, looks very fluffy. However, he still looks very young. His face has no wrinkles except crow's feet. His muscles are full and his skin is very shiny. "This is one of the directors of the Imperial Bank, Mr. Wichi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stunned and immediately reached out. "I am very glad to meet you, Mr. Wix."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Wilhelm also greeted Du Lin, and smiled and said, "Jack he said a word less, I am only the vice chairman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"That is also a very great identity. After all, the central bank is the largest economy in the empire. I am very happy to meet you here!" Du Lin will not feel that he has insufficient power because he said a "deputy" word. The most powerful is the chairman of the board of directors, but in fact, the deputy directors responsible for daily operations. The chairman of the board is the decision-making level, and the vice-president is the executor. It seems that there is not much weight in speaking. It is actually quite horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person making the decision will never know if the person performing will increase or decrease something when performing his or her own decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two released their hands, Wive moved a little to the side and gave up the position to the second gentleman. Mr. Jack still plays his role. Detailed introduction of Du Lin to the second guest, "This is the Speaker of the Chamber of Commerce of the Angus, currently hosting the size of the Chamber of Commerce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Angus looks a lot older than Vichy, almost 70-year-old, not tall, with a few hair, and many age spots on his face. His eye bags are drooping, and it looks like he is not awake. Time has left too many traces on his face, making him look old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is holding a walking stick. At this time, when he laughs, he can only see the corner of his mouth rise, but the muscles on his face are still drooping, and the silk is still moving. Mr. Lin, I have heard too many people have said about your deeds. It is very great. It can be said that it is the most successful businessman in recent years. No one. I am honored to have the opportunity to meet you in this way. This is my lucky day. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is very talkative, and Du Lin also compliments him a few politely. The strength of the Chamber of Commerce is still terrible, and Du Lin also Curious about the identity of the third person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just this time that Mr. Jack did not take the initiative to introduce Du Lin, but this third gentleman took the initiative to take a step and reached out, “Imperial Treasury Paul, you can call me Paul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Durin, though he reached out and held it with him, he looked at Jack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vice chairman of the imperial central bank is not surprised here. The speaker of the imperial chamber of commerce is not strange here. He is strange when Mr. Jack and The Imperial Ministry of Finance has a relationship. To know that the most hated Mr. Jack and the poker should be the Imperial Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation. Every year, a large amount of black money has escaped the taxation after washing the whites by their means. But soon Du Lin understood it again. The most important step in whitewashing these black money is to pay taxes. Perhaps this explains why Mr. Jack will let Paul appear here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
