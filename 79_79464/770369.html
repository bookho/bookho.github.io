			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to do it now?", the Buddha is playing with the pistol in his hand. The sound of the pistol is not very loud when shooting, if the sound is smaller in the house. It is hard to find out that it is a gunshot without listening carefully. At night, there may be exposures, because the evening environment is more peaceful, and the sound will be very abrupt. But doing things at night also has the benefit of doing things at night, such as easy evacuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is always the best protection color of barbarism, how many murders happen at night is not unreasonable, at least the murderers will like this time period, both romantic It is also easy to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought about the decision to start later, but it’s not impossible to do it now, but the deterrence is not enough to let those provincial people have something to do with him. Become honest. Even those people are dead, and other provincial sages don't necessarily know why they died, why they are today, and they don't know what they are angering. So the best way is to start the night before their action and clean all the backbones directly. When they find out the next day, they will feel a thick cloud over Irian’s. On their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it won’t be done tonight, it’s not without it. These people who have explained the gray dog ​​are listed, so that Savi can recognize the door and it is convenient to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a seemingly stable and prosperous city, the night turned to the daytime, when the first golden sunshine sprinkled on the earth, the whole city finally fell into Quiet. Du Lin started early, today is the first day of the official filming of the Freina crew. As an investor, he must go to the scene to give everyone a boost. This movie is not important for Du Lin for the first time. What is important is that this film is also a bargaining chip with the George family, and it is a bridge between him and the city hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no love in the world for no reason, no hate for no reason, I want the lords in the town hall to close one eye at a time. Only eyes, then you have to feed them. The old party's city managers are very direct, they just tell everyone directly, hurry to bribe them, as long as the money is enough, they will never take care of those shit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new party is different. These are ideals. In order to be able to display their political ideas, they need not money. Money can embellish their lives, and political value is what they need. Give them enough political resources to make them look good, they don't care what you have done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This film has played such a very important role, and it is also the first formal cooperation between Doolin and the City Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, the film crew has already laid the camera track for shooting in the port. The new colored camera equipment is much heavier than the black and white camera equipment. It will not only be trembled by a single person, but also people can't eat it, so they used the method of orbital shooting as soon as they came up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of this film is not repeated, Scott appeared in the port early in the morning to coordinate the dispatching work. Perhaps because of the special urban atmosphere of Irian, many people are willing to cooperate with the film crew to shoot. Originally, they also considered the idea of ​​asking a little extra actor. Even the cruise ship that arrived in Irian in the morning after a night of sailing was very cooperative, and took the initiative to undertake the work of shooting a huge background. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they have a small condition, that is, the ship number must be taken in, and the captain and the chief officer must also appear in the film. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are all small things. The scriptwriter has just modified it to solve the requirements of the captain and the chief officer. The two little old men are excited to put on new clothes. The captain also spent two dollars to take care of his beard, and then appeared in front of the camera with his pipe. He has two lines, the first officer has a sentence, and then Freena looks on the side of the ship with her suitcase. It was a very simple play, but it took more than ten times to complete. Some tourists never looked at the camera unconsciously, or smirked at the camera. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director was surprised when he found Du Lin’s arrival. He just wanted to stand up and say hello to Du Lin, and Du Lin’s hand was pressed on his shoulder. The action here was a bit bigger, and it immediately caught the attention of Scott, and he also came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you think you want to come over? I thought you didn't have time." Scott took out a cigarette case and gave a cigarette to Doolin. I also ordered one. "Everyone values ​​this movie. You may not know. Before the filming is over, I need to spend half a day here. You really found a copy for me. Good work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders and looked at Freena, who rushed down the ramp, and said with a smile: "You are not complaining that it was too busy some time ago." Are you still satisfied with the leisure work?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott smiled and didn’t talk, as a staff member of the City Hall, Leisure is not a good thing. Fortunately, this matter is indeed very important. The mayor is also staring at it, otherwise he can really be active. He suddenly thought of one thing and said it casually. "Isn't Alexander talking to the city hall about the food festival? The mayor passed there, and Alexander also started to promote the event. He hopes to use the platform of the film. , pushing the food festival to the entire empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin frowned a little, and later realized that this is the built-in advertising? The eyes of the capitalists have always been keen, especially those things that are good for themselves. They can always find business opportunities first. "He wants to promote the food festival without problems. Ask him how much he plans to pay. I can’t let me spend After the money took the film, what kind of food festival did he give to him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"50,000 pieces!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This offer is still sincere. After Dulin clicked his head, he turned and waved and left. He hasn't thought about how to deal with Freina. If you send her to heaven, it is not impossible, but I always feel that it is irresponsible for myself. According to this idea, everyone in the city of Tener should be killed because they may expose something hidden by themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of Doolin here is a very headache, and now the most important thing is to find a "legal" way to explain that you have so much money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freina in the studio saw Du Lin and saw Du Lin’s departure. She recently went out late and dulin was just staggered. In fact, she also had a bit Things want to talk to Du Lin. As the producer and heroine of this film, Freina's pressure is actually very heavy. If nothing is seen in the filming, Du Lin's investment of 500,000 is equal to playing. On the one hand, she is saving the expenses of the crew, and on the other hand, she wants to discuss with Du Lin about the next shooting problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s blunt, she has no bottom in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the film she is not the heroine, whether it is success or failure, it is a success for her to play her role. Now, not only must she play her own role, but also ensure that there will be great repercussions and successes after the film is released. She has not even slept well in these two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Mickey in the fifth district looked around for the trail of gray dogs, saying that today he will bring himself to get money to buy guns, early morning people I am gone. After looking for a few gray dogs who often did not find the guy in the alleys that sold the anesthetics, Mickey had a bad feeling. Just when he considered whether to give up the plan, another person found him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Greyhound was taken away." When this sentence came out, Mickey even gave birth to the idea of ​​running away immediately, but the second sentence made him change. I have to laugh and cry. "He had smashed the glass of someone else's house when he last reminded him. The family reported to the police. On the way back yesterday, he was hit by a policeman who was patrolling at night. Now he is in the detention room of the branch office." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
