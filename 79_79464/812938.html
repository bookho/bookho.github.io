			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are never afraid of bloodshed and fighting, we will always defend our power, no one can take them away from us, even if we give life to it The price!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because there is a fighter like Buddy and you, we have the future!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are not inferior people, we are the sons of the first kings and the gods, the world will give us justice, please believe this, not too long!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May the king and the gods be with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the passenger ship that is far away, Budi’s face is exposed A strong face. Du Lin may not be old, but his thoughts, his character, his love for the Guar race, surpassed everyone here! He is the pioneer, no, he is a saint, a saint who can appear in the fables of the Guarts for thousands of years! He will lead the entire Guart nation to revival! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buddy’s arm is a little curved. He has been fractured for too long and has been difficult to fully connect, but he doesn’t care. If an arm can be exchanged for the rise of the entire race, he is willing to pay another arm to his own life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without living in pain, those who struggled in the quagmire of endless darkness never know their desire for life, and the repressed life. Love. No one likes the darkness. Everyone is willing to embrace the light. When praying for the inability to exchange for light, only use both hands to tear the darkness. Even if you will fall into the blood of hell, you will never regret it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s second stop is Monter, and he has a lot of hope for this place. Once the market in Montreux can be opened, not only can he bring him Bringing huge wealth can also make the life of the local Guar people on a higher level. This is a relatively more open place. Apart from tourists from within the empire, there are many tourists from outside the empire. The collision of various cultures makes people living here have a strong ability to accept new ideas. Once the status of the Guars has changed, it will soon have a synergistic effect and radiate out, so that visitors who come here feel the difference of the Guars. Only people’s views on the Guars have changed. Only get more fair treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin knew very well that a small group of people could not change the fate of the entire race, but when this little monk led a large number of people to stand up, the fate would change quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly a quarter of the shipments, that is, three thousand tanks were prepared for Monter. There is a month to fight for the fight, even if it is a fool, maybe I should have laid a large site at this time? With the site, there will be people who are unwilling to join him. There are more people joining, whether for their own benefit or to better manage these people, he must expand outwards, and this is one of Doolin's plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that after he arrived in Montreux, it seems that the situation here is a bit different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Sai Bray did not receive Du Lin in his small restaurant, but arranged in the most luxurious hotel in Montreux, he can understand the SEMLAB do this The reason that made him feel strange is that the five fellow members he left behind did not come to meet him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After commanding the Buddha and Airlis, Du Lin changed his clothes and went to the restaurant to see Sebray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Sebray has changed greatly from the last time. He wears a luxurious dress, each pin is almost hard to find, and the hair is built. For a moment, the smooth fat face was even more white, and even a diamond-studded watch with almost 3,000 pieces was worn on the wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am still wondering if I have to call you. I have not had enough goods in my hand. You have already arrived. It is really too timely! Sebray sat across the table, ten fat carrot-like fingers crossed, and two sapphire rings exude a faint glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled. "Is it sold out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebre nodded, "It's too good to sell, people are rushing to ask, how many times have you brought this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three thousand boxes!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebray smiled with satisfaction, three thousand boxes are 36,000 bottles, which means he has another income of ten or two hundred thousand. He has never seen such a profitable business. No wonder those smuggling gangs are all fierce. Such a big profit, I am afraid that even those rich people must be tempted? However, he is better than those people, and does not need to take any risks. Someone will bring the goods to the door and let him enjoy the benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was more enthusiastic about Du Lin's attitude, no one would have money and hatred, he immediately took the money out, and there was a beautifully packaged box, all put together. He patted the suitcase. "There is a lot of money for the goods. In addition, I personally give you a little thing." He pushed the small box that was very beautifully packed to the left hand side of Doolin, looking forward to urging: "Open it and see if I don't like it, I will give you one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebre’s tone made Doolin somewhat dislike, but he didn’t care, any In the mentality of the poor and rich, there will be a little change in personality. It can be said that it is inflated, or it can be said that it is not known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flipped the gift box for two laps and looked at Sebray before disassembling the box. There is a gold watch in the box, so the gold watch must be purchased at least 5,000. If you don’t like it, after all, it’s a gift from someone else, and you don’t like it. I have to say that I like it. To be honest, this kind of watch with thousands of watches is not seen in the eyes. Maybe he will be very concerned about it more than a year ago, but as a hero who has passed the "100 million" before and after, he really can't see this thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t like Sebray’s character that he just squandered with a little money. In Du Lin’s opinion, only a small part of the money that Sebray earned belongs to His, more is belonging to other gualts, he does not have the power to move others' money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no expression of surprise on his face, just nodding his head, showing a faint smile. "You have a heart, things are good, I Received."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebre can not care what Du Lin has, he What I want is that Du Lin accepts this thing. The chefs just started serving at this time, and both of them closed their mouths in due course. After the chefs left, Du Lin asked the food and drink in the neckline and asked: "How many of my friends? Why didn't you see them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Sebray did not pause at all: "They are in the north of the city, there are still things that need to be dealt with there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered very quickly, expression There was no change in it. Du Lin secretly observed for a while and accepted this answer with suspicion. As he split the steak in the plate, he asked: "When I came over, it seems to be very calm. How do you coordinate with other local wine merchants and solve this kind of thing peacefully. To be honest, I am very curious. It’s a big deal!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebble put down the knife and fork, rubbed the greasy lips with a napkin, and every time he talked, the fat on the gang would tremble with the opening and closing of his lips, which looked a bit funny. He shrugged his shoulders. "I don't think there is anything that can't be negotiated. The key is to be sincere!" He extended a finger and clicked on it. "To tell us, we are all doing business, not what." Hatred, as long as you can find the bottom line acceptable to both sides, then there is nothing to talk about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted his chest, the button of the shirt may be a bit guilty. He seems to be very proud. "I am a businessman, Mr. Doolin, please don't ignore my instinct as a businessman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If sitting in him Opposite is a naive idealist, maybe he can be fooled by him. But who is sitting opposite him? That was Du Lin, a man who quickly climbed from the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Sebray said the word "negotiation," Doolin knew he was lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The profit of private liquor is even the eyes of the rich, the reason why they do not touch these is not that they do not look at the profits here, but they have to take care of themselves Decent and social responsibility. Of course, it can be said that their desire for money has been reduced, and they began to chase political power, but this does not mean that the rich are not tempted by private wine. If there is no ban on alcohol, what are these gangs? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he did not see the members of the fellowship, knowing that he is the president of the fellowship. He is not an unexpected choice, but has already notified in advance. Even if those members really have something, they will definitely find a way to come over. Can Sebray kept open the topic and let Doolin have some shadows in his mind. He suspected that those members might have died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a good-tempered person. First of all, everyone must reason. At the same time, he is not a good-tempered person, as long as he violates the rules he sets, he will be angry. When a good person is angry, he is sulking, but when the bad guy is angry, it is a storm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before and before and his temptations on Sebray, Doolin asserted that Sebble was lying. He put down the knife and fork, took a napkin and dipped his lips, took a cigarette from the cigarette case, and spit a sip. "Let my people come over. This time I come here to save the goods, but also Bring them back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
