			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is sales?" Mark seems to be sitting calmly and calmly behind his desk, and he is not worried about the unknown sales results today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the desk that people can't see, his legs can't control the rapid shaking, and the lack of parenting moves to ease the inner tension. The 50,000-filled tape was transferred to the major cities of the Empire along with the George family's newspaper sales channels. According to the latest market survey of the George family, the entire empire was influenced by the newspaper family of the George Family's syndicated syndicate, which is about 8 million, accounting for 30% of the total population of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 300,000 to 500,000 people who can afford tape in the eight million consumer groups, in order to avoid "not enough to sell", Mark personally filled 50,000 tapes and sent them to twenty-eight cities with consumption potential for sales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also sent professional salesmen to contact the middle class who ordered the newspapers in these cities by telephone, and taped the tape with a discount of 20 yuan. The time-limited price of nineteen nine is pushed to the community. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows if it can be successful, can it be as hot as the company’s top speculation, waiting for the trial of fate in a restless anxiety is a cruel Things, even if Mark is the ruler of the teacher, can't help but start to shake his legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary in the short skirt pushed the glasses frame, and the skin on the smooth thigh reflected the healthy luster. She glanced at the watch and shook her head. Sir, today’s sales results will not be known until after one o'clock at noon.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark wiped his face, “Sorry, I am too anxious.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 50,000-inch tape includes content and body, and the total cost is about 1.7 million. If there are some accidents, although the George family’s genre can withstand If you can afford such a loss, you will lose a little bit of it. People will also examine and question his decision, which is not conducive to his future mastering the family and family industries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times pass by, even lunch has forgotten to eat, Mark simply can't feel the passage of time and hunger. He is constantly writing and drawing on paper, all of which are simple lines and abstract shapes that cannot be understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as he himself seems to have forgotten this and when he started to paint, the secretary came to him with a smile. He looked up at the secretary a little, just as if he was asking. "What are you doing?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. President, our preliminary sales results have been counted...", Mark’s eyes suddenly recovered from the Qingming, he was seated, slightly decapitated, secretary Miss continued to say, “We have sold 39,000 sets of tape in twenty-eight cities, and almost 7,000 users have expressed their willingness to buy, but this cost exceeds their spending plan for this month. I hope to be able to purchase our tapes next month!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary’s face showed a slight sigh of smile. "Congratulations, Mr. President, we have succeeded. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, success, the Empire Star entered the industry one step earlier than other companies, so Nasa has only got the total number of users so far. More than 40,000 people are approaching 50,000. But for them, the first batch of products almost sold for 40,000, and it is estimated that this number will rise after the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those who have the intention to buy, the next tape may sell 60,000 super sales, which is definitely a big blow, enough to rewrite the industry’s right to speak Big explosion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Mr. Mark’s happiness is like a child, and the secretary’s face has a happy smile on her face. She is very capable of understanding Mr. Mark, sometimes she I feel that Mr. Mark needs a careful and professional understanding to take care of him, such as herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still many people who have such an idea. Everyone knows that Mr. Mark’s wife has returned to the embrace of God because of dystocia. Before he was 40 years old, he It is always a junk stock. Pretentious, unwilling to bow, in a school relying on a meager salary to waste life. However, after he was forty years old, he was soaring, not only became the head of the current George family, but also created the highest sales miracle in the tape industry. His future must be brilliant, if this can be involved In his life... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mark quickly recovered from the surprise, and his mouth squinted his face became more serious. The pen in his hand was constantly moving between the two fingers. Pendulum, "What is the sales volume of the Empire Star? Does our sales have an impact on their sales?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a very important issue. It also shows that Mark has completed the transformation of a scholar to a businessman in the past two years. The market for each industry is limited. When foreign spoilers join in, they will impact the original market and plunder the market share of other companies. Then through the overall sales to obtain a rough figure to represent the capacity of the market, and finally to delineate the nature of consumers, to produce targeted products, this is what a businessman should do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was before, Mark’s question was meaningless, thinking that they could not know the sales of Empire Star Media in this issue, but Nasha took over. After this company, some less important data can be learned in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Secretary untied the folder in her hand, the tape of Imperial Star Media is also on sale today, Mark chose to sell his own tape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the outside world, this may be a strong alliance, and continue to maintain the dominance of the two companies in this industry, but Mark understands that this is a war, He is demonstrating and showing off muscles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Secretary shook her head. "The sales of the Empire Star did not drop significantly, but there was some improvement." Mark, but did not find any frustration from Mark's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand, you run a second, inform reporters and feature publishers, we need a press conference!", he said, stood up, Go to the rest room and start picking clothes for yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in sales of the Empire Star is not bad news, but good news, which represents two things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing is that there is a higher level of consumption capacity in the consumer group. If one can buy one, it means that he has enough Wealth continues to consume, and may buy three or even four in the future. The George family is a means of monopolizing the newspaper industry and may be used again in this industry and create miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing, this market has not yet bottomed out, and it is far from reaching the limit. If the sale of the tape of the George family led to a significant drop in the sales of the Empire Star, the market is so tens of thousands. If it takes more money and energy to compete for the market of tens of thousands of people, then it is obviously not a cost-effective thing. The sales of Imperial Stars have not declined, which means that there are still many consumer groups to be developed, and Mark will also increase investment in the George family companies and tilt the resources within the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same information was also fed back to Doolin's ears through Nasha. Duane, who had some worries about Nasha, calmed her emotions and told her that she would continue to stick to the company's main route as long as she followed the steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head slightly after hanging up the phone. Nasha was still young, but she played a big role, for example, he could know the George family. Sales and other data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Du Lin did not have any concerns, because he was watching the tape issued by the George family, and honestly there was no point. They mistakenly used the medium of television as a traditional medium like a newspaper, or the superiority of their monopoly in the newspaper industry, so that they could not find out the way of playing in a new industry. For example, they broadcast the news in the newspaper in the way that the host reads the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin feels that this is boring and lacks enough appeal. Something in the newspaper is only learned in a different way, for example The host reads, then why spend twenty or thirty dollars to sell luxury goods like tape, instead of buying a newspaper directly? The content in the newspaper is updated more timely and cheaper. This is an advantage that “reading the newspaper” does not have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there are also "stage plays" in the back, the venue and landscaping are indeed much more luxurious than the Empire Star, and there are several very famous stars among the actors, and The content is also higher, and the plot is more complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the episode of the Empire Star is a mass entertainment with a slap in the face, then the sitcom of the George family is a historical drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People will applaud such a serious historical drama, but let them keep watching... It seems a bit difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entertainment needs to be easy to understand, what is needed is to enable people to enjoy a happy time, not to be educated, not to learn or to reflect That is not entertainment, it is a cram school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehensively, Du Lin can understand Mark’s intentions. He uses the foundation and financial resources behind the George family to injure people and want to occupy more Market consumption positioning, but still that sentence, they do not understand this industry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why they are able to usher in a good start, very simple, inertia consumption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
