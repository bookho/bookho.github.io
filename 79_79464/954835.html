			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin had a lot of questions to negotiate with Maggs, and they stayed in the study until the evening. During the period, Mrs. Taili went in and sent a few times of water and snacks. The attention of one big and one small man was not at all in these things. They concentrated on discussing, thinking, and sometimes arguing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Terry has rarely seen such a situation in the past few years, after Magus betrayed the aristocratic class and overthrew the royal rule to usurp power. Many of them are thinking alone in a study, or reading a book. The dull atmosphere made the whole house seem to be covered by a layer of shadow. Even the death of the second son did not give Magus a lot of emotional expression. He just licked his dry eyes and continued to mention the pen review. An important official document. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today is different. When Mrs. Terry sent something, she saw what Magus was excited about and what Du Lin was arguing about, no matter what they were arguing, Taili The lady would like to thank Doolin because he at least gave Magus a rare ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two very tired men came out of the study, Magus actually held up a lazy waist. "Suddenly I feel some hungry, you want to eat. What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the same reason, Doolin is younger than Magus and should be more resistant to hunger, but the truth is that he is also very hungry. Those sweet and greasy pastry, he didn't want to eat the third one after eating the second one, and Magus didn't eat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked up at his wrist and he hesitated. Finally he declined the idea of ​​going to eat with Magus. He knew Magus dinner. It should be eaten with other cabinet members, because his Otis market listing plan requires a lot of things to perfect. Just now, when he heard that Magus was going to station in the city of Otis, Du Lin almost dropped the teacup on the ground. Fortunately, Magus realized that he had said something stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of troops in the city of Otis will definitely lead to a significant decline in the number of tourists in the city of Otis, before the empire does not want to abandon the gold mine in Otis The only thing they need to do is to ensure that the gold mine can continue to dig. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a bag of pastries and left the villa with Mrs. Taili. After Magus returned to the study, she closed the door and then called. . He dialed an internal number, and only a special line can dial this number, in order to prevent ordinary people from guessing these special numbers. Soon the operator connected the telephone line to the Imperial Intelligence Service. Magus asked: "I heard that intelligence personnel have fallen into the Federation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man on the other side of the phone sighed. "This is not a great thing. Some people will disappear completely every week. We can't accurately know whether they were caught in a secret detention or took the initiative." Contact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I heard that someone was caught in the federal side? If it is this public information, it is best to deal with it. A moment!", after the speech, only the sound of breathing is left in the earpiece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the receiver remembered the answer "know". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus then asked again, "Have you sent someone to monitor Du Lin? If so, first withdraw it, if not, then it is better to go Check your hand to do something that might affect the empire's plans for the next decade!", after that, he hangs up without waiting for the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words before their conversation were definitely not without purpose. He was reminding Magus that some spies had already appeared beside him, then It means that there are also some empire intelligence personnel around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as he said that listening to federal tourists talking about this matter is simply a ghost, Magus believes that he found that there are intelligence personnel around him, so look for An excuse to tell him, someone is staring at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Magus very unpleasant, and Du Lin’s current value is far higher than the mistakes he made. Young people always make mistakes. If he has a desire to rehabilitate and has a very important role in the empire, then he may wait for his role to disappear before recalculating the previous account. The first thing to do now is to squeeze out Dolin's more imaginative imagination, which is much more important than the slight loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that Magus feels at this time is Du Lin’s birth. How good is his aristocrat, his mobility, determination and response It is enough for him to take on very important duties, even the Prime Minister may not be impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the farmer is a farmer after all, and even if the farmer’s son appeared on the Imperial Parliament Hill one day, it only played a background role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap between the nobility and the civilians can never be filled with the progress of the times. On the contrary, the depth and span will become larger and larger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because between the nobility and the civilians, there is another group called the capitalist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed, shook his head, dialed a number again, "Investigate, who recently contacted Du Lin, whether it was detected or not Come out and withdraw the first time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time his call was given to the New Party’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, which was managed by the New Party Committee but was only responsible to two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the chairman of the New Party Committee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first corner after leaving Magus Villa, Du Lin threw a bag of pastries into the trash can, and he shook his clothes and dispersed. I smelled the smoke on my body and called a taxi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not been a long time to leave school at the Royal College. The teacher with a face like a nun has cleaned up the things on the table, and some arrogant eyes look at the podium. The next student pushed the glasses frame and turned around and left the classroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a special class. To put it simply, the Royal Academy is divided into three blocks. The first camp is for those students who are good at learning and they work through their own efforts. Become a member of the Royal Academy and be proud of it. They will become the pillars and mainstay of the empire after graduation, supporting the healthy operation of this empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second camp is the aristocratic students. The predecessor of the Royal Academy was the aristocratic school. It was only a tradition to accept the invitation of the nobility. Coupled with the potential strength and connections of the aristocratic group, the Royal College has a special advantage for aristocratic students. You don't need more or less knowledge to accumulate, as long as they are nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third camp is a talented student like Freina, and there may be nothing else, but it is rich. The number of topics and research projects at the Royal Academy is unclear, and the main factor that constrains the Royal College's academic field and hands-on ability is the lack of money. There are always some people in the society who are unique in this respect, so they have become the "elite" of the Royal Academy and are classified in the special class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professors of the college are not very loyal to the students who teach the special classes. The professors themselves still have a little bit of a look at the students of these special classes. After all, the gap lies. that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thirty years ago, these people were not allowed to set foot on the land of the Royal Academy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freina is still recording the knowledge that the professor just said, she is not young, her comprehension is worse than other younger students, she can What you do is to select the important part of the professor's words as much as possible and then record it. After you go back, slowly explore the deep meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, go out and play together at night? It’s too bad for a few days a year!", a blonde young The guy walked to Freina's desk. He leaned against the table next to him, his hands in his trouser pockets, his hair on his forehead, and he tried to make a look that I was so handsome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy knows Freina, or most of the students know Freena, after all, the heroine of the first color movie is not so easy to forget. The reason why the classic is the most important one of the classics is that people can't forget, and they can't forget the deliberate forgetting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena smiled. "I am very sorry, I have to put these things over and over again." She pointed to the notebook on the table, young The man shrugged and turned away, causing a small sneer behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their recognition of Freena, it seems that Freena was the goal of pursuing it. It was indeed like this at first, but it quickly became one of them. After the young people fell into disappointment, they inspired the young people to win. They are constantly changing their designs to pursue Freina, and even bet on it. Everyone takes out 10,000 pieces. If anyone does, then all the money is that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unfortunately, no one has succeeded so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the popularity of male students, some female students don’t like Freina so much, what’s behind them, and completely isolated from her. It’s up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a concern for Freina, her future is not on anyone here, she does not belong here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished the last paragraph, she packed up and left the classroom to walk to the dormitory in the school. The Royal College used the whole year. An uninterrupted educational model with one day off every week. It is said that the current arrangement is much more relaxed than when the school was called the aristocratic college. At that time, don't say that one day's vacation is a day, only one day in a month, and will be assigned various tasks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
