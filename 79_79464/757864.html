			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric sat in the office with a painful expression on his face. He looked at his stomach and looked very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it uncomfortable? Did you eat overnight stuff? The mosquitoes here are really amazing. I also suffered a lot when I first came.", Ellis gave him a cup of cold water, and Eric shook his head with a wry smile, drank a little, and the painful feeling seemed to be alleviated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is a psychological problem. When Eric knew that the next person was a big man with a face in the city of Irian, he felt a burst. Unbearable stomach pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Juan good to deceive? No tycoon in this city is a kind-hearted person. Juan was only a boiler burning at first. His job is to provide hot water for some construction sites under construction. There are a lot of workers on the construction site, and the work is very heavy. Every day, sweating and sweating, if it is not cleaned at night, it is difficult to fall asleep, which will affect the work of the next day. The workers at the time were not as stressful as they are now, and there was no workers' union fighting for their rights. Most of the workers lived in a temporary room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foot odor, sweat odor, and a variety of body odors test everyone's nerves. Later, the foreman made a request to the developer. Every worker needs to take at least one hot bath before going to bed every day, so he has the job of Juan. Only one penny is needed for each bucket of hot water. A bucket of hot water can be used for bathing by two people. There are almost three hundred people in the entire construction site. Every day, a piece of money with a lot of money makes him quickly have a fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thought after owning this money is to run a business that can make money for a long time, instead of selling hot water, which depends on the duration of the business. After examining a variety of businesses, he turned his attention to winemaking and wine sales. There is no sales restriction on this wine. Many people are not rich, but as long as they have a little money in their pockets, they will spend it on the wine. Although the profit of selling wine at that time was not particularly high, Juan looked at the sale at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first worked as an apprentice in a workshop. After learning for about half a year, he felt that he had mastered the winemaking technology, so he bought some wine barrels privately. I used some raw materials to try to make wine at home. Probably because he did not keep it secret, this matter was known to the owner of the workshop. After he scolded Juan for a meal, he took him out and told Juan’s behavior to all the bars of Irian at the time. Even if he brews the wine, no one will buy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a result, Juan was unwilling to accept. After more than a month, the master of the workshop was drowned in a casks by accident. Juan forced himself with his own money and the relationship with some foremen. I bought the workshop and laid the dominance of Juan in the Ilyan wine industry. He has taken a series of clear or dark means to become the largest supplier of alcoholic beverages in the Irian region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are still some workshops, they have been unable to shake his position. In the Irian area, his product market share has exceeded 80%. . He can easily get another 20%, but he understands that if you make all the money yourself, then it should be history. So he kept 20% of the market for those workshops to compete with each other, but he sat firmly on his throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a guy, what is the difference between cheating him and looking for death? Whether it is Juan, who was previously ruthless and decisive, or Juan, who is already married, is not a small person like Eric who can be offended, but the problem now is that he must offend Juan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin and Juan come together, and if they don’t think that they’re going to be wrong, Eric feels that it’s good to tell the truth. In the process of negotiation, his expression has been very stiff, and there seems to be a dim sum. There is no doubt about Juan. If one day someone runs over and wants to buy his property, he can't resist this kind of non-voluntary behavior. Whether the price given by the other party exceeds the total value of his industry, he will not be happy, and he will Rick is so reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Juan gave Eric’s East Coast Entertainment Company a price of one million, which is a price that can be said to give Eric a face. How much money everyone has in mind. In the face of such a price, Eric naturally could not resist. He signed the contract with great pleasure and “sold” his shares in East Coast Entertainment Company to Juan. After Juan directly handed over one million of the imperial central bank’s promissory note to Eric, he politely asked him to leave. Sitting at the desk chair, Juan patted the armrest of the chair with a smile. “From now on. East Coast Entertainment is ours. What plans do you have next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat on the sofa on the outside of the desk, his legs crossed I took out the cigarette case in my pocket and pulled out one for myself. After taking a smog, I slowly said: "My friend has had a little thing, so I thought of another plan." He took another breath. With a sigh of inhalation, Juan did not ask questions. He knew that Du Lin could say such things on such occasions, and it must be meaningful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin spit out another cigarette, he continued: "Do you know Ilyan holiday?", Juan nodded, saying that some time ago, there was a lot of publicity about the film of Irian Holiday, and he certainly knew, " I also plan to take a color film to replace the Ilyan holiday, and we can also cooperate with the City Hall, with the help of the first step of the color film, plus the 16 theaters in our hands, not to miss Ms. Nasha. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Du Lin’s point of view, Juan is very much convinced that the George family is a newspaper tycoon, a trust in this industry, holding three in his hand. The special feature syndicate, no one can shake their position. However, in the field of the film industry, they can only be regarded as strong newcomers, and even cause some people to deliberately target. But if there is a first color film, this gimmick, as a catalyst for the George family in the cinema industry, will definitely be able to start! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is so much good news, Juan still has a little hesitation, "What if they don't want to do it? I think they are more likely to be from us." I bought this film source once and then played it myself. Even from another perspective, we have more demand for them, because if there are not so many theaters that can play color movies, no matter what movie we have How good it is, it can't be seen by people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So we bought the East Coast Entertainment Company." Du Lin smashed the cigarette butt at In the ashtray, the butt moved backwards. "In other cities in the state, we have to build a cinema quickly. A city is built at least three to five. The whole state is sixty or seventy cinemas. The construction price of each cinema. Including the land, about 50,000 to 70,000. If we have two or three states in the hands of the theater as a condition of negotiation, do you think the George family will cooperate with us?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as he points Hundreds of cinemas in these states will become the industry of the new company. He only needs to build the theaters in the north. The theaters in the south teach us to do it, spend less money, do the most things, I think John. Mr. will not refuse.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You should know that at the level of Mr. John, money has no meaning for him. What he is looking for is A political force! And we can help him expand his influence!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words are a good dispel of Juan’s doubts, accurate In the case of Doolin, the idea is to build up your own system before the George family layout is completed, and even some places do not need to be built, as long as there is a look. When he and Du Lin held the two or three hundred cinemas in the south, they were just holding the film of the first colored film. Even if the George family had become a monopoly in the newspaper industry, they had to choose with him. , cooperate with Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
