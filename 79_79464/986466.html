			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of the Bureau of Investigation suddenly recalled all the agents who handled the illegal cases outside to maintain law and order. These agents were somewhat inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurately, there are some complaints. It seems that the department of the Bureau of Investigation is far more "upscale" than the police, except for the salary and the name. In addition to the sense of superiority, there is only a sense of superiority, and there is no practical advantage. According to the laws of the Empire and the interpretation of the agency, the Police Investigation Bureau is a high-level comprehensive investigation agency with a wide range of functions, but only for cases of serious nature. Serious nature means that it is a major case, and there are many high-level and high-level concerns. In such a case, it is absolutely too comfortable to pay for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opposite day, after they started to take over the work of the police station, they discovered that the original police station was the real "welfare institution", and they would not encounter anything too. Dangerous things, and there are many ways to get money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car stopped and was fined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn’t look like a good person, asking for a certificate, no? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two fines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This two-piece fine can be dozens of times a day, especially now that the law and order situation is not good, there are more squats on the street and a look outside the store. It’s not a good guy, these guys give them a lot of money. Not everyone will carry a resident card with them. This is only less than half a year after the implementation of the city of Otis. Many people take it after they have been taken home. Who is there to bring it? This allows many agents to drop three or five pieces a day in their own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they are called back, and the director asks them not to allow to go to the street to maintain law and order, how much to make them complain a little. This one-month income can be much higher than the salary of one month, and it ends here. Even some people feel that it is better to go to the police station to work together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time after Donald knew the news, he called the Bureau of Investigation and asked him why he did not follow his own orders to let the agents go to the streets to maintain law and order. In the fifteen minutes after the evacuation of the agents of these investigation bureaus, three more cases of burglary occurred and one businessman was beaten and injured. The responsibility for these problems cannot fall on the police station of Carter and the no one who has been dismissed, nor can it fall on the police investigation bureau, and can only fall on his "inaction" mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of the Investigation Bureau was silent for a while before giving an answer. "I am very sorry, Mr. Mayor. Our Police Investigation Bureau only accepts the appointment from the higher authorities. The City Hall has only the right to propose to us and has no management right. The important power department of the empire, we should abide by the laws and systems of the empire, so I am very sorry that it is very difficult for us to go out to maintain law and order before the orders of superiors, I hope you can understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a voice from the State Bureau of Investigation?" This is Donald's first reaction. It must have been the pressure that Du Lin gave to the State Bureau of Investigation, and the State Bureau of Investigation ordered that this be banned. Excited, "I understand, this thing does not blame you, I will make other arrangements!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hanging up the phone, Donald felt that he was completely A huge net is firmly trapped, and it also feels the complex struggle that faces after the second person is promoted to the first person. These struggles not only came from within the political arena but also from outside the political arena, which made him difficult in internal and external affairs. He never thought that the mayor of a city needs to face these things. Is it true that all mayors will encounter similar problems? At the same time, he also had a realization that as long as he can overcome this difficulty, he will be able to grasp the true power of the city of Otis, the real power, the true power after the isolation of Doolin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" He was lying on the sofa and looked at his secretary with some defeat. His secretary is almost 50 years old and has been following. His father worked at the Imperial Capital. After this operation, he was selected as a New Party member of the city of Otis, and his father left to send his secretary to Donald to help the kid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary calmly thought for a moment, "I think the most important thing for you now is to reorganize the police station. After you dismissed the post of Director of the Hite It is a good thing for you to leave the police officers together. This will prevent you from cleaning up all the pressures that the police station will face in the future. It is the best choice for them to leave. Now you only need to trust you. People can be inserted into the police station. I believe that the re-established police station can play a key role in stabilizing the security of the city of Otis!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Donald He immediately turned over and sat up. He glanced glanced at his secretary. Indeed, he did not think of this. He was only fainted by the brains of Hite and a large number of police officers who had taken the initiative to leave their jobs. Originally, he still had to spend some hands and feet to clean up the police station. Now he has not cleaned himself? He immediately picked up the phone and made an arrangement immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he is also a politician from a nobleman. He naturally has a lot of resources. Under his arrangement, the candidate who succeeded the regional police chief of the Otis City has appeared. He also gave the new director a great Personnel power allows him to randomly select the people he thinks are feasible to enter the regional police station and give the police officers the preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police station that was deserted overnight became busy again, and the new director brought more than 50 people, although not as much as the Shanghai special period. People, however, can barely maintain the security problems of the current city. And the new director also got a very powerful privilege from Donald - no restrictions on the right to fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police can take the initiative to fire on any criminal who appears to be attacking and is at risk to himself. This is where the new director dares to take up the post. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new director is called Singer, Ogildin, who has a very rich resume, has worked as a thug, has smuggled, and has opened a bar. In the past few years, when Donald was very young, he had a conflict with some guests in his bar. Singer stood on Donald's side, helping him settle the troubled guests and get Donald's friendship. In the following years, when Donald needed someone to help him dare to work, he would hand over the task to Singer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that they have a close relationship. In essence, Donald is looking down on such people. He just used Singer to do things for himself. In the face of important interest choices, he will certainly not hesitate to abandon Singh. But now, Singer is very important to him, and this is a dirty job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, after dawn, the City Hall issued a decree. In view of the frequent criminal activities in the city of Otis, violence often occurs, so the City Hall ordered it from now on. A curfew policy is imposed. All people appearing on the street after 9 pm will be considered suspicious and will need to present their own resident card. If there is no resident card, you need to follow the police officers who found them to go to the police station for identity registration and investigation. If there is any resistance, the police officers can directly shoot the suspects after firing the guns if necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decree came out of the city as a whole, especially in the seven major casinos. It was only after the evening that the casino was the hottest. If a curfew was imposed at this time, it would have a fatal impact on the casino business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald also knew that there would be people protesting. He immediately called the shareholders of the seven major casinos into the conference room of the town hall, giving a solution, that is, the casino. The shuttle bus will not be counted in the inspection scope. In other words, guests in the casino can take the shuttle bus to the casino or return to their hotel, and the police will let them go. Although it seems that this is the best way to do both, the shareholders of the seven major casinos are completely disappointed with Donald. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
