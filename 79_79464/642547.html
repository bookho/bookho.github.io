			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I have to mention a little here, so there will be a feeling of Mabdura style...", Delil holds a handsome The boy's hand carries some graffiti on the canvas that people don't understand. These graffiti are often referred to by normal people as "art." Sometimes what art needs is to not understand, or what are the artists who are proud of the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt the little hand full of masculinity in his hand, gently lie on the boy’s shoulder, greedily sniffing the smell of the boy’s body. . He felt like he was about to fly to the sky. If it wasn't for the last two damn guys who were still staring at him, he might have to bring the little boy to the secret room to discuss higher art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some greedy retracted their hands, straightened up, looked at the drawing boards in front of other children, and nodded constantly. Although Delil’s own artistry is still to be discussed, his ability to appreciate art is not bad. Among these children, he is very optimistic about a girl and a boy. He thinks these two children have real artistic cells. In the future, I will be able to enter a good art school and become a great artist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he imagined that he had trained many artists, and when the art world was also famous for himself, a rough and barbaric footstep alerted him. He turned around impatiently, holding his chest angrily, and squinting at the guy who had broken the mood. He knew that person, the driver of Mrs. Vivian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of his face is like the level of his artist, it should be super-class, and immediately changed a smile to meet. Just as he was about to ask why Mrs. Vivian did not come in, the driver first opened his mouth. "The mayor invited you to go and I hope you don't make me embarrassed."<br /><br />&nbsp; Delier's face changed slightly. He arranged for the assistant to take care of the children. Then he sorted out his dress and wiped some cosmetics again before he returned to the mayor's manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Delier’s second close encounter with the mayor, the first time at the art auction held by the Chamber of Commerce, he is Wei Wei Mrs. Ann appreciates some artworks, just as the mayor is also there, but after the two sides only say hello to each other, there is no more to say a word. The mayor of the city even left directly. Therefore, this is the second time that the two met at a close distance. This made Delier feel a little discomfort. He couldn’t say why he felt uncomfortable, but in general he was flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that the lady has been buying some expensive artworks from you, isn't it?" The mayor did not ask him what he wanted to know, but instead opened the topic that was neither important nor relevant. Head, "I can see that the lady likes art very much, and the artworks are full of a storage room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreil during the period of the mayor’s speech He can only make a laugh, and he keeps his guilty conscience. He knows the "real situation" of his artworks. To put it bluntly, nothing more than the reward for the pimping of the noble ladies. Direct money is too easy to be suspicious, but the way to pay for the purchase of art is much normal. Because everyone's ability to appreciate art is different, maybe you think that a certain art is worthless, but in the eyes of those who like it, it is invaluable. This controversial and extremely desirable payment method has left De Lier with a lot of trouble and enough concealment. To this day, many people still don't know what his real business is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How much do you think your so-called artworks can be worth?", the mayor’s smile looks very kind, but I don’t know what happened. Delier always felt that the mayor in front of him was very dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably... worth some money?", Delier carefully tried to say, see the mayor did not have a clear objection, he was a little loose With a sigh of relief, he continued: "The art is actually very difficult to understand. It is like Mr. Mark's 'Genesis'. It is just a circle drawn on a canvas with a variety of colors. This painting technique and painting results me. It can also be done, but the meaning of what I paint is far from the high evaluation of 'Genesis'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said with a strong heart: “Everyone has a position in art that is either high or low, but art itself is priceless!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor is very serious Head, "You said something, but I asked the great artists from Ordo and the capital to taste the artworks you sold to my wife. They told me that those things are not necessarily comparable to the apprentices. , what do you think of this?"<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s just that the children are just graffiti. The real purpose of their existence is to cover up the “funding”. How can they sell real art to these noble ladies? ? Delier just smiled awkwardly and did not raise any objections. He is willing to know that shutting up at this time is more meaningful than explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
