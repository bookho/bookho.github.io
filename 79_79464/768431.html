			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the City Hall held a press conference. In the press conference, City Hall spokesman Scott complained about the recent years. In the midst of a car accident, a data was presented to the media and society. From a decade ago to today, the frequency of car accidents has risen nearly 100 times, and the casualties and property losses have been even more alarming. All of this explains the significance and necessity of Prime Minister Magus' request for a new transportation bureau. The Irian region will also follow the pace of the emperor and set up a brand new department, the Ilyan Regional Transportation Bureau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of doing this is to solve the more and more frequent car accidents, and to register and restrict the people and units with cars, so that those who have created a car accident Escaped vehicles cannot escape the legal sanctions with the help of luck, but also to improve the transportation system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one sentence, there is a new department in the city of Illian, and new regulations will be introduced for vehicle and traffic management. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car accident of Little Fowlers can be said to be very timely. If the victims of the car accident are just ordinary people, there is still some resistance to the establishment of the promotion of the Transportation Bureau. Psychological, for example, was called the head of the police station in the past by the mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s because of the car accident that is the Little Fowlers that people can pay close attention to this matter, so that the mayor can seize a good time. Directly announce the entire society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the old Fowlers, do you think that the mayor’s adult is making a fuss about using the car accident of Little Fowlers, that is not everyone’s concern, even the old happiness Sis can't say anything, after all, it is the mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The culprit in the car accident was sitting on the sofa with a sullen look, and Du Lin just gave him a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question, Buddha did not notice or noticed that there were other people in the car, but he still drove the truck directly into the past. Their goal is to be a little Fowlers, and no innocent people should be brought in. Doolin thinks that he is not a good person. Although he has done a lot of crimes, the injury has killed many innocent people, but he feels that things that can be avoided are avoided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question, Little Fowlers did not die, the newspaper published the recent recent situation of Little Fowlers, although he was very injured, but the rescue was timely. Lived down, this should not be. Of course, not all of them can be blamed. At that time, Xiaofulles was squatted on the ground after being taken out of the car. Who knows that he died? If you get off at that time, you will probably expose yourself. He has half responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question, the location and timing of his choice is not very good, too many witnesses, no one can find the Buddha, or find other clues. According to Du Lin’s plan, this should be done at night, preferably when Xiaofu Lesi is alone. The police and hospitals in the middle of the night are still working normally, but the rescue speed will be slower. Even if Little Fowlers was not killed on the spot, delaying the rescue time was enough to drag him to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this can't completely blame Buddha, after all, he doesn't have much experience. All the previous plans were done by Doolin himself. He couldn't guarantee that every plan was flawless, but at least he would consider a series of factors, which also blamed him for not having time recently, so he only criticized it. A few words of Dudu. It is not to blame that he did not perform in place, but blamed him for not considering other factors when planning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this point, Buddha himself has nothing to refute. At that time, he only thought of characterizing the nature of the accident as a coincidence, ignoring some other thing. With this lesson, he should grow a lot when he is asked to make certain actions individually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So boss, do you want us to go to the hospital to kill him?", Ellis asked a question to open the previous topic, not forgetting The Buddha made a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin was thinking, Savi immediately jumped up. "I am going to go, I can get it!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stunned him and shook his head. "In the hospital, the children are the most easily watched people. You can honestly review the lessons I have today." Said that he looked at the Buddha, "you make plans, you are responsible for the implementation, and finally you are responsible for finishing. Do you want to go, how to do, I do not interfere. But this time you have to get things done, otherwise I don’t worry about letting you make a plan.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a shy color on the handsome face of Buddha’s face. He nodded hard. “You can rest assured. He can't live tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point is still rest assured, he swears, "This time is like an accident, if you want a knife or Pistol or something, I advise you not to go well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too much obvious assassination would make people doubt The car accident is not a coincidence or an accident, it is targeted with assassination. If the other party is just an insignificant little person, in order to maintain the stability of the Irian and the apparent safety of the City Hall, it can still be pressed. But Little Fowlers is not a humble little person. If he is assassinated, it will definitely cause a heated discussion in the entire city of Irian, and even in some respects will be turbulent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Hall will definitely not allow such a thing to happen. In order to calm down the opinions and opinions of the rich, it is necessary to solve the case as soon as possible, and it will certainly be traced to Doolin. Dooling is not afraid of them to check, but it does not mean that he is willing to be investigated, so things that can be avoided are still avoided as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the death, the Buddha will leave, and he will solve the problem of Little Fowlers before this evening. This actually involves a situation where the information is not equal. If Du Lin knows that Little Fowlers is already a waste, there is absolutely no need to continue. Perhaps he is the best punishment for him. In his life that may or may not be long in the future, every second of his life is a punishment for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not long before Dufu just left, Totti took the couple to visit Du Lin again. To tell the truth, Totti can hardly imagine that the young man in front of him has decided the life of others. This kind of person Totti has never encountered this life. There are indeed some gangs in the fifth district, but those gangs say that they are gangs who compliment their claims. They are more like a group of people who have not worked all day. The villains who are looking for money together are still some distance from the gang. These people are no longer bad, and they don't seem to dare to design killings, but Du Lin dares not only dare but also does it, which makes Old Totti feel a sense of fear for the upper class he realizes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the rich people in the upper class and Du Lin the same people, they never put the lives of others in their eyes, for those who are not as good as themselves Life is taken to win? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Totto does not know, so he has some fears and some gratitude to Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grateful for the things that Du Lin promised, he finished well, knowing that he must bear a lot of responsibility for doing this, and what he is Can't get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the loyalty of the ordinary people who have nothing to do with Du Lin, what kind of loyalty can this bring to him? Interest? Money? Power? Status? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing, but he still has to complete the oath once he has accepted allegiance as an ancient aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Totti very moved and grateful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
