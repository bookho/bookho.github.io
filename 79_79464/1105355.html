			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Caldo opened the paper bag and took out a shareholding document. Every page was very carefully read. There is no doubt that these documents are true. of. He has his own way to verify the authenticity of these documents. There are always some unknown anti-counterfeiting methods in the financial field, such as seals or signatures. There is too much emphasis on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the current assessment of the Atlantic Group, the consortium’s industry market value is estimated to be between 4 billion and 6 billion federal shields. So there is such a large span because the future prospects of several important companies of the Atlantic Group are very good, including joint construction, and United Pharmaceuticals. Although United Pharmaceuticals has not been very prominent in the past few years, they have already had several very important patents in their hands. It is only a matter of time before they want to start large-scale profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these things, plus the reputation of the Atlantic Group, enough to allow them to borrow from the Commonwealth Bank to about eight billion federal shields. If you do it again, 10 billion is not too big a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Caldo doesn’t know where the money will be used by Doolin, and Doolin borrows so many federal shields at this special time, if it’s used To save the market, the risk of this money will not be too small, but it will not be too great. At the same time, the influence brought about by the rescue of the market is enough to allow them to make more money after the sudden attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universal values ​​of society will remind people of the contributions of the Atlantic Group in order to counter the evil forces from the international community. People will pursue this new consortium and Put your money into the pockets of these consortium companies and let them live better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if Doolin spends the money on the short federal shield, it is definitely a serious test for the current situation and is likely to trigger A series of accidents, even Caldo has been able to imagine many more serious and serious problems will break out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand subconsciously and wiped the cold sweat that was rubbing the side. It is now November 23, and the temperature on the federal side has dropped. At around zero, he still felt hot and sweaty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Doolin...", he organized the language and refused his request as much as possible without angering Du Lin. "I though I preside over the daily work of the Federal Bank, but I can't do the financial business like this." His tone is very sincere. "This requires the Ministry of Finance and the President to sign the approval before approval."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled. "I know very well, but someone needs to submit this application, isn't it? I am not suitable for this job, and you are the most suitable person. Whether they are willing to approve this request, Your work is done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caldo has no chance to refuse, he considered it, nodded, and then glanced at Doolin," Mr. Doolin, I have some problems with my investment recently. I don't know if I can..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, we are friends, I am always very friends Generous!", although this request is a bit strange, Du Lin still satisfied him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to the Federal Bank and immediately reported the matter to the bank’s governor. As for the Treasury’s side, he would like to say hello, he thinks it should Let the president decide to decide. After doing all this, he waited quietly in the office and shoved away all the work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent that he is the deputy governor of the Federal Bank and presides in his daily work, he has long been a naive person, and he is very upset at this time. He is not sure whether he is guessing it is true or not, but he has made the worst plan. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than an hour later, the secretary knocked on the door and sent the approval document from the president, along with the seal of the Ministry of Finance. Such a large amount of money borrowing must be to alarm the Ministry of Finance. This money is enough to cause a certain degree of turmoil, and the federal government is not allowed to know that the Federal Bank can not get the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the document, Caldo arranged the next process, the loan program, to clean up the valuables in the office, including some private things. He was packed in a suitcase, and by the way, all the money on hand was transferred to the account of the overseas bank. When he sat on the sofa after doing everything, he was a little frustrated with his face, but he quickly got up. He pretended to be nothing and like every day, smiling and saying goodbye to the staff, leaving the office building, driving slowly back home. At the moment he closed the door, even the shoes did not change, and rushed into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife is making dinner for him, and now there are still seven days away from the New Year. The federal "New Year" is not January 1, but December 1, which is related to religious beliefs and folk customs. It is necessary to say clearly why the federal beliefs may need to be said on December 1st. The history of a long period of time is not far from the New Year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You forgot to change your shoes, dear." His wife stood in front of the kitchen stove and made a thick soup without looking back. The sound of the leather shoes on the floor and the soft bottom slippers are different on the floor, and only need to be heard with the ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caldo did not entangle this problem, he said as he walked upstairs, "I will pack your things at once, then call and call the children back, we Leave the Federation overnight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movements in his wife’s hands were tight, and when he turned back, Caldo had already gone to the second floor. She turned off the kitchen stove and chased it up, and ran and asked, "What happened? Why should I leave at night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cardo who has already ran into the study is too late Explain clearly that he rarely has a roaring snarl, "I will do it as I requested!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife stunned and then panicked I ran back to the bedroom, picked up the phone and dialed the phone number of their child's school, and asked the teacher for leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caldo has come to realize it, this is a bureau, a terrible bureau, the federal bank and even the federal government, already treason. They are betraying the national interest, and even more terrible is that he has inexplicably become one of the "hands-on". After working in the bank for so many years, he is well aware that once the federal shield collapses, the entire federal economy will be fatally hit. At that time, those who sell their national interests must throw out some people who attract firepower in order to quell the grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the people with sufficient status and power like him is obviously the best scapegoat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now don’t go, maybe he won’t be able to go after two days, and the situation has not completely deteriorated. He must leave the Union immediately. He had more benefits in Doolin because he had guessed the seriousness of the problem. Suddenly a lot of short selling in the foreign exchange market is only a sign. He guessed that after Du Lin got the tens of billions of federal shields, he would start to sell wildly in the foreign exchange market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 billion, enough to incite the current situation of the federal shield, as long as the federal shield can continue to decline, coupled with increasing shorts, and others he still does not Knowing the means, the federal financial crash is only a moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that Du Lin's request could not be passed, because even he could guess that Du Lin was one of the main forces of shorting the federal shield. How could the Federal Bank and the federal government not know after learning about the loan demand? Since they know it, why do they agree with Doolin’s request? This shows what? Explain that the federal government and the head of the government may also be involved in this financial tsunami, and may even be one of the behind-the-scenes hands. Coupled with the growing conflict between the old and new consortiums that have long been associated with the federal government, he is faintly aware of what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His expertise tells him that he doesn't want to die, he must leave now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, he took his family out of the nearest customs, and the target was...the empire. He believes that this crisis is a manifestation of a huge conspiracy. It is very likely that the empire is also involved. If so, why not stand on the side of the winner and even apply for political asylum in his current position. He believes that the imperial people will give him high treatment, and they also need some people to stand up and accuse the federal chaos to gain more political interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not know that their originally planned scapegoat actually ran one. Of course, this did not have much to do with him, because on the whole board, He is both a chess player and a chess piece. He is also a scapegoat who is preparing to run anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day at 9:30 am, the funds of the Federal Bank have been put in place, he immediately informed Mr. Jack, and the Minister of Finance of the Imperial Cabinet, can proceed One step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 10 am, there was a sudden large amount of selling in the foreign exchange market, causing the Federal Shield to experience violent shocks in the foreign exchange market, the new generation consortium within the federation What has already been discovered, they immediately transferred a large amount of funds to take over and asked for urgent consultations with the federal government. The often very frivolous federal government suddenly became tempered, and some unknown changes have caused the demands of these consortia to fail. It was not the finance minister who left on vacation, that is, the head of the Federal Bank of China could not find anyone, and these new consortia were caught off guard. At the same time, all the financial evaluation agencies of the Imperial Sheridis Street began to attack the federal financial policy of the last two years, detailing their lack of solid financial results. The foundation has seen the economic performance of the federal government. The Imperial Central Bank and the Southern Commercial Bank also issued a new risk assessment, arguing that the unprecedented increase in the federal shield has a huge hidden danger, and recommends that all customers reduce their federal shield. At the same time, because the currency relations between the two countries ended, the Imperial Cabinet announced that it would no longer maintain a large amount of federal shield foreign exchange savings in order to stabilize the stability of the currency exchange rate between the two countries, and began to sell the federal shield in the foreign exchange market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
