			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The office is very chic, much better than I thought." Mr. Mark walked into Doolin’s office with his assistant, at least The outside looks much better, at least without the peeling of the wall, or the pitted wall, looks clean and tidy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha did not follow, such an occasion, she can only get angry, it is better not to come, so Mr. Mark has only three people here, he is a man, And two other young women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deve fell back to the side after pouring coffee for everyone, Mark has not forgotten to say thank you to Dove. Among the information that Doolin knows about Mark, Mark is a very alternative capitalist, or the capitalist who is the least like a capitalist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Old John’s tough wrist, Mark’s approach is obviously much milder, which is exactly what John’s demands for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to integrate the newspaper industry, John was said to be "full of blood," and there were dozens of newspapers that closed down because of him. In the newspaper industry, he Like a shark that has been mixed into a lake, and disobeying his rules of the game, it will immediately be devastated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the rule monopolizes the "resources" of the industry, he has no opponents under the rules of the game, so he needs a A gentle person comes to hold his achievements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur’s guy can’t, he’s too jerk, too messy, and the family’s handing him will only be defeated by him in the shortest possible time. He can't even make his uncles and uncles, how can he survive in this intriguing world of business wars? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of Arthur’s ignorance, Mr. Mark, who has been a professor, is obviously much better. He has sufficient theoretical knowledge. Once he gets started, he can combine practice and theory to find the best way to go. This is why John dares to decentralize. At least this son can't easily ruin the achievements he has spent in his lifetime, so that when he dies, he can go to heaven and brag about others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing after Mark’s appointment was to raise the treatment of the special feature, and to lower the request for all George’s newspapers, this action was immediately The support and goodwill of all people paved the way for his family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So someone is born to do this, no matter when he comes in, he will soon become the most dazzling person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Mark’s management, the entire empire’s newspaper industry revolves around the George family, and is more responsive and more active than John’s use of hard-line methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time in the city of Otis, it is for the "Imperial Star Media Company" in the hands of Dooling, and this also needs to thank Arthur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur sent a player to Old John two or three months ago, it is to maintain the feelings, by the way, in the eyes of the elderly, a few more, so as not to be old The guy forgot. It is also because of the tapes that Arthur brought, that the old John who can't keep up with the frontiers of the era of science and technology, and the Mark who is busy with the rest of the day are not enough to know the world, there has been a brand new The medium, a medium with great potential and a great threat to the George family, is spreading rapidly and even spreading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They immediately did a careful market research and invited some experts to do a more systematic, more formal analysis, and finally they came to a conclusion - in ten years In the world around, the player will replace the newspaper as the main medium for people to receive news information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of technology is enough to gradually reduce the price of the player to the point where everyone can afford it. Once that day, the traditional form of the newspaper industry will be in jeopardy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a point of view, the George family made a thorough investigation of Doolin, including his Imperial Star Media Company, so they Give the acquisition, or cooperation two options. They think that Doolin will choose one of them, they have this confidence, because they are the George family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the god Du Lin was back, he looked at Mark quietly, and Mark looked at him with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mayor of Doolin, very embarrassed, can you ask how old are you?", said he explained, "I am sorry I don't want to I want to link my age to my duties, but I am simply curious. I know that my daughter is already 19 years old, but she is still not growing up. Seeing you actually makes me very embarrassed because everything you do is better than me. What you have done is even more amazing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Mark's purpose is as simple as he said, purely wanting to know how big Du Lin is. When most people and Du Lin communicate with each other, they always ignore the problem of his age. They will think that maybe he is just a face, but he may be in his twenties. There are two reasons for this illusion. The first one is that Du Lin’s momentum is not something that young people can have, more like those who are at the age of forty-five. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the way and skill he said is as much as he has been honed in society for many years. It makes people feel that they are communicating with themselves. I have such a illusion that I have experienced my peers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought for a moment, "I am just twenty years old this year, it is just one year older than your daughter, Mr. Mark.", his face is not red. I skipped two years of self-reporting for myself. The age of 18 and 20 may be only two years old. In many people’s eyes, one is eleven twenty-three and one is twenty-seven and ninety-nine. The level of a generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Mark’s face is full of envy, and it seems that he doesn’t want to talk about acquisitions or cooperation at all. “You are so young and have the status and family business,” To be honest, I admire you very much, because you have many peers and even the qualities that we have not in this generation. You can be successful with these qualities. You are the most obvious example."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have come to talk and continue to say: "In fact, when I first left the family, I also thought about doing a career myself, then let my father marry, leave the family, and throw away The surname may not have a chance to get out of the way. But maybe you know it later, I have nothing to lose, I can only continue to teach, I am not the piece, at least at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Later my father..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark is like chatting with friends and saying a lot of content that has nothing to do with Doolin, Doolin is not urging He, on the other hand, listened with relish. There are some things that really need to be overcome before they can understand the true meaning of life, and also benefit him a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chat, I talked about 11 o'clock at noon, seeing that there are still more than half an hour Du Lin will get off work, Mark's assistant is quietly He licked his sleeve and reminded him of his purpose here. He scratched his head a little embarrassed and apologetic, and then looked at Du Lin very sincerely. "I think I have a very good relationship with Mayor Doolin. I always want to say something in my heart. I accidentally misjudged it." Time, very sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin waved his hand. "It doesn't matter. The chat process with you also gave me a lot of valuable experience and lessons, so I am honored to be able to chat with you for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let's talk about business right now?" Mark asked, Du Lin nodded. He didn't use so much useless this time. He said directly: "I want to buy your Majesty." 'Imperial Star Media', if you like, open a price!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not slow down for a long time, finally saw a ratio He was more "direct", and he suddenly laughed. "Mr. Mark, you are really amazing!" Du Lin lamented. "The last time I told your daughter, it was not for sale. I want Mark. Since Mr. John succeeded Mr. John’s work, you should know how important a medium is to people like me!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark is not allowed to nod, for the government Officials say mouthpieces are a very, very important tool that not only promotes themselves Governance philosophy, but it is most conveniently used to attack the opponent's weapon, but also to themselves and voters together. Therefore, the George family has monopolized the newspaper industry, but no politician has dared to start with the George family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dares to be the first one, because the first one must be a public enemy. On the contrary, the current Georgian family’s neutral position can be appreciated and supported by everyone. He understood what Du Lin said. If the Empire Star can stand up in the near future, then Du Lin will benefit more than the company itself, and he certainly cannot sell such a company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Mr. Mark was not discouraged and asked a question, "So how about our cooperation? We cross each other and share resources. Although it may be in this line We are already behind you and others, but we can say that we have a unique capital compared to resources. This is a cooperation that can bring benefits to both parties, but cooperation can only make us an enemy and suffer losses. Think about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin kept his smile on his face, he shook his head. "Please forgive me for the next words, there may be some harshness, I think you It's a nice person, so I will tell you this, and I hope you can forgive me for being rude!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please say!", Mark is correct Sitting posture, serious is like a student in the classroom, this is a very smart guy. He knows how to get closer to the relationship between people. What's even worse is that he said that you are sorry after a knife, and you will choose to forgive him. Sure enough, no successful person can easily succeed and have his own special place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
