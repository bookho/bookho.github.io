			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vice-Chairman smiled gratefully. "Thank you very much for your thoughts. I am very happy with this kind of cognition, but I don't have to. We have Special funds are used for this purpose, and it is not suitable for private equity funds to participate in this area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some things can let outsiders intervene, say Du The military club that Lin is engaged in, Margos will agree to do this, because he did, will not hurt the important foundation of some empire. However, there are some things that Magus will never let outsiders intervene, especially the internal affairs department of the Security Commission. Their power is very large, and of course there are corresponding restrictions, but if foreign interests are allowed to enter these organizations. In the near future, the power of unparalleled money will appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a military foundation. Almost every year, military generals are retired. These generals have a heavy hand during their tenure, and they often manage a certain Military bases and even several military bases. If it is not the last second, no one wants to give up such power. The impact of their love of the stack and the threat to the empire are much higher than when they retire to join a private foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Magus would also like to thank Doolin and others who have made organizations and individuals such as foundations, clubs, fraternities, and so on. The generals successfully left. Because they let these generals still self-righteously hold some power after leaving the company, they can allocate some benefits and can live as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Security Council can't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the Security Council is corrupted by money and invaded by capital, this means that many things will be out of control. Money, coupled with enormous power, is enough for those capitalists to start from pure capital games, find political spokesmen, develop to the development of capital terrorist forces, and have an unparalleled harm to the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is also very clear about this, he smiled and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence lasted for an hour and forty minutes. When the people in the carriage heard the sound of the air outside the compartment, and the speed of the car began to drop significantly, everyone was loose. With one breath, I finally arrived at Fanlier, and then the people who captured the Freedom Front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there any things I don't know about these days?" After returning to the villa, Du Lin pulled off the tie and unbuttoned the neckline, taking a deep breath and sitting on the sofa. Sitting with the Security Committee and the military colonel is not a comfortable thing. Even the Du Lin will do it, but it is only a negligible emotion in his heart, because he believes in his own plan. I can't find the flaw in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the other party finds a flaw, it may not be able to take him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with those who have no money and no prestige, grab them and fight them into a prison and let them learn how to spend the rest of their lives. They will be honest about everything they know. But to deal with a very influential social celebrity, there must be sufficient evidence that Du Lin has been operating two things for years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first fact continues to expand the power of his own hands, whether it is the fellowship or his agent or his own interest group with his core. He is armed himself in madness. The power of capital, the power of society, the power of morality, and the power of politics, as long as they can become the power of weapons in his hands, he is as close as possible in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing, he has been active in public opinion, and every other time, he has to make a news to make all the people in the entire empire Relive the name of Doolin and let this name go to the hearts of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only by doing these two things can he have the power of self-protection, because he has gradually changed from catching the mainstream to becoming part of the mainstream. It has become the mainstream, and some means that can't be seen can't be used on him, for example, trapping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Tener, the mayor of Peter had to deal with him, just let people grab him and throw it into jail. This is a sentence. Things, even no evidence is needed. Because at that time, he had neither the weapons that made Peter jealous in his hands, nor the loud reputation in the society, so that Peter did not need to frame him, he could directly put his fate in the palm of his hand. But look at it now, even if Magus wants to deal with him, he must get enough convincing charges and evidence, otherwise this is the persecution of the minority, the greatest harm to human rights, freedom, justice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the benefit of money and power. While restricting those who want to hurt themselves, they also have the power to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dove took Du Lin’s tie on the sofa, unpacked it and put it in a textile bag that was specially used to identify whether it needed cleaning. At that time, the management company on the villa side would come to pick up the need. The washed clothes are washed and dried before being sent back. The charm of money has quietly penetrated into the industry, which is the magic of money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Several couples have been asking you when to come back these days, they left a call and confirmed that someone will answer at any time, I hope you can come later. Can give them a letter.", Dev took a lavish silver basin and walked to Doolin, took a towel for Du Lin for a moment, let him wipe the dust on the face and hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know who?" Du Lin wiped his face and handed the towel to Dove. "Every day someone will know me, but I don't." I must know them and I don’t want to know them.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deve gave the pot to another girl, standing behind the sofa, holding a shoulder for Du Lin, while pinching While replied: "It is said to be a mining company, it seems to have done business with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his eyebrows and immediately knew who it was. - Those who have pitted his money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person walks the night, the guy who walks in front of him is suddenly smashed by a knife in the dark, and he can’t go backwards. I have to go through the place where there is a knife, so what will he do at this time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The correct answer is that he will think about whether there is any hatred between the person who is killed and the person who is swearing, so it’s such a shocking Murder case. Then they will extend the scope of thinking, then do they have a hatred with the sultry guy? They didn't know who was holding the knife in the dark, so they guessed what the people who had been killed recently did, and recalled whether they did something similar to the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, did, they all pitted Doolin’s money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, when so many people have died, the power of money is great, but there is always something that is slightly more resistant to money erosion. There is one thing called life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is priceless. People often use this way to describe the preciousness and beauty of life. However, this is only the wishful thinking of writers and philosophers. In a remote place, a few hundred pieces can kill a person. Yes, it has increased in price compared with the previous years. Because of the economic recovery, everyone has a little money in their pockets. know. So the price of life may be worth a few hundred, maybe a little more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for big men, the price of life may be higher, whether it is their opponent or their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one or two million to lose your small life value is not worth it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it’s not worth it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People often feel sincere admiration for those ups and downs, such as the legendary Helmond of Xie Lisi Street, experienced several bankruptcies and several times The resurgence of the mountains, now with millions of assets and luxury homes, is the sun in the minds of all stockbrokers. People are loyal to his mythology, but who knows, his father is the top of the Imperial Central Bank, and has a good personal relationship with several big men in the stock securities management office, and who knows that his mother is a listed company? The shareholder director holds a huge economic empire? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these big men, money is just a kind of incidental product that comes naturally in their social circles, as long as their social circles are not separated, as long as their connections Still, money is not something that cannot be obtained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mine owners can get the start-up funds from some places even if they are bankrupt, for example, they will do intermediary trade with the West Mine, or do private trade, only It is necessary to introduce the supply and demand sides to trade without the West Mine, they can draw a generous commission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to your own life, money is really not important to the big guys! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, they feel that the death of the executive committee and Hendry may have something to do with Doolin, even if it doesn’t matter, they will also think that they want to keep their lives safe. It’s not a coincidence that they are all connected, thus saving their lives, even if they only bring psychological comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The easiest way is to send the money cheated from Doolin in a lot of points and attach a sum higher than the empire. Interest on central bank credit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, they are not scams, they just borrowed a loan from Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a look at his neck, closed his eyes, and enjoyed Dove’s hands on his shoulders, a sly answer Road: "Let them come to see me tomorrow, 10 am. I will not see anyone after this time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
