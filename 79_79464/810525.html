			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a minute!", Juan’s hand trembled, the heart seemed to be squatting by an invisible handcuff, he had a breathless The feeling of qi. His body began to tremble. This sentence almost exhausted his whole body. He used 3.8 million of his own, including the brewed by the money borrowed from 2.3 million. A series of property rights of the workshop were placed on the table and spread out one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has some black shadows flying in front of his eyes. He lifts his arms very gracefully, rubs his eyes with his arms, and his lips are slowly open. After taking a deep breath, I asked: "Why... there is no liquor license? I remember the liquor licences are for you!", he lowered his head slightly, just as the carnivores locked the prey and prepared to pounce on the bite. A moment of gloom, "Are you taking less, or getting something wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a feeling that he may have been pitted again by Du Lin. This time, he really can't climb again after falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He prayed to God, prayed for the goddess of fate, and prayed that they would not abandon him. He screamed at the table with his hands and snarled loudly. "What?" What about my liquor label? Why not here?!!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, no liquor license means that he can’t make wine even if he buys it back. The Irian area is also a contraband investigation bureau, although in other states this department is very strong, but there are only two people in the functional organization of Irian. But even if there are only two people, they are also agents. They have the power and obligation to seize all the workshops that illegally brewed private liquor. They have the right to arrest the relevant responsible persons and let them be tried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A workshop can be worth 3.8 million? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this not a joke? Everyone knows that the reason why a brewery can sell this price is the liquor license. The workshop is worthless. To put it plainly, there are some buildings and some appliances. The liquor license is the most important thing, but the problem is that there is no! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James took a step back. He smiled and raised his hands to show that he was not malicious. He also wanted to appease Juan. "Huan, you listen to me." ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't listen!", he slammed the table and rushed to James, but the bank security that had already been prepared might have let Juan met their top boss? Immediately, he pressed Juan to the ground and cut his arms back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan's face was red, his cheeks were against the ground, and the blue veins on his forehead were getting more and more blue. He stared at James with a wild-like look like an animal, snarling and screaming. He had a layer of white saliva in his mouth and he struggled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James sorted out his clothes, sighed, and his expression was a little colder. "Juan, don't be excited, you heard that I said. Actually. In the previous period, Du Lin had already bought all your liquor licenses and liquor licenses from the market price. I think you are a kind of selfish behavior, but according to the bank regulations, when you can't pay off the loan. At the time, we have the power to make a remedy for the collateral to make up for the loss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Mr. Doolin’s internal level is higher than you, even the headquarters Will not dismiss his request, I am only a branch president, I can't break the bank's regulations, you have to understand me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan is stunned again A few words, gasping and continually struggling, intermittently asked, "Why, why don't you inform me? Do you know what you have done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;James slightly frowned, and to be honest he suddenly hated Juan now. Gas is not so euphemistic. "When you intend to mortgage all your industries to borrow money from me, I warned you. Be careful, there may be some risks that you can't predict. But what did you think at the time, What do you say, how do you do it? I am not sorry for anyone, even if it is not in this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said something bad, even if The liquor license is here. Do you really think that Mr. Doolin can't get more money? Juan, I respect everything you have done, and I respect your dedication to the cause, but you have to figure out, this is not You are here to give me the money!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James once again sighed and glanced at the security guard. "Throw him... Please go out, I don't want to see you again." "To this person!", said that he pointed to the documents on the ground, "take these things together, that is his things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan was Two five big three thick security guards, like a chicken, lost from the side door of the bank, There he spent 3.8 million bought a pile of paper. is not that right? It was a pile of waste paper, but for the pile of waste paper he not only spent more than a million of his last, but also owed 2.3 million. He was finished, even before the auction, he did not feel that he was really finished, but now he knows that he is really finished! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has nothing left, all things and people are leaving him, not only that, he owes two hundred and three hundred thousand, he numbly glanced at the pile of waste paper on the ground, smirked and climbed from the ground, head Not going back to the street. Just as he walked out of the alley, he squinted slightly, and the strong sunlight made him somewhat uncomfortable with the light. When his eyes adapted to the light intensity at this time, they immediately became fangs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that Du Lin was talking with Alexander’s other two friends who borrowed his money, and he immediately confirmed the one before him. The idea, all this is prepared by Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has had a little regret at this time, if he really sold the theater to Doolin, does it mean that he has reconciled with Doolin? Does it mean that he still has the opportunity to leave here and go to other places to spend the restless life quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not so many reasons, and there are not so many if, he slaps the dust on his body and walks to Doolin, and Du Lin sees him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin and Alexander said that after they said goodbye, let them leave first, then smiled and stood by the car and looked at Juan until Juan came to him. before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man has no previous style, it is like a street wanderer, so... poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Juan did not ask why it was meaningless, maybe only at this time, his brain is the best. He looked up at him with a blank expression and looked up younger than him. Du Lin, who is taller than him, "Do you want me to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Du Lin took out a cigarette from his pocket. After he lit it, he put the cigarette and the lighter in the hands of Juan. He thought about it with a grin. "In fact, my purpose was to cooperate with you at the beginning. I am not a selfish person, nor do I object to having money to make money, but when you start to peek at my things, it is bound to have a knot between us. Not that you have completely bankrupted me, that is, I killed you. Only this ending!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I won this game, Juan, willing to gamble and lose!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of what Du Lin remembered, he took three owes from his pocket. "Hey, these debts have been transferred to me. From now on, I am your creditor, two hundred. 300,000, oh..." Du Lin shook the owe and put it back in his pocket. "I will give you a chance, Juan, beg me, kneel down." .! & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp my 2.3 million to write off, come in this last chance "<br <br /> & nbsp />;Dooling pointed to the ground under his feet. At this time, they were outside the gate of the bank. There was also a luxury car parked by Doolin. Many people always cast their sights here without knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot eyes are concentrated on Juan’s face, giving him an unspeakable anger and fear, his body is shaking, Du Lin’s Trembling, there is also a trembling in the choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hates his weakness, but he also knows that he will lose even his last dignity to the bastard. He suddenly laughed, and it was very abrupt, then he laughed and laughed. He took a cigarette from Du Lin’s cigarette case and gave it to himself. He smiled and coughed and shook his head. “No, Du Lin, I haven’t lost yet, there is one thing that belongs to me, you are forever Don't want to take it away. I went bankrupt, I lost only wealth, but my dignity, my life, will never belong to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Don't want to see me kneel down in this life, I can't have that day!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also laughed, "So should I congratulate? You, at this moment, you found your own most precious thing? Well, I should go back. Suddenly, losing 2.3 million is really a little nerve-racking.", Du Fula driving the door Let Du Lin sit in. After closing the door, Doolin approached the window and shook the glass. "Right, I found a place to hide at night. I heard that they would send the tramp to the seventh district. It’s terrible!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car slowly started, then mixed into the bleak street and gradually disappeared Distant corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan’s smile gradually revealed his sadness. He now feels that the only thing he has to do is to take the children away, at least not need them to bear all of these. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked back into the alley, glanced at the contracted ladder, found a wooden branch and hooked the extension ladder, then climbed up the ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan, who did not stand tall, stood at the top of the bank at this time, he smoked, the wind was very strong, and it was cold, cold drill Into the bones. One cigarette followed one, I don't know how long it took, the cigarette case is empty. It was already at noon, but he couldn’t feel a touch of warmth and tightened his clothes. He looked out and looked at the street below. He said to himself, “a bit high”, then turned and turned Go inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
