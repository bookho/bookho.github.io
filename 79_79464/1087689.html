			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current owner, the father of the sisters of Hill, can see his contempt and even hatred of his daughter from his attitude and eyes! He hates his own girls and even hates them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very strange emotion, which makes him and his sister go farther and emotionally, no matter what they did for this family. Can't let him like them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used to be like this. At that time, he still loved his daughter, but after his daughter became an adult, he told himself from his nephew that he might pass some kind of When it was a good way to get an opportunity, from the conversation he had with his daughters, he began to hate his daughter, hate them, and didn't want to see them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is actually ill, excessive guilt makes him turn his owe into hatred, it seems that only hatred can make his conscience better. Can make him feel that he has not done anything wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the two girls are a pair of women, so they have not done anything wrong, they are wrong, why they do not refuse their request, why They don’t cry and say that they can’t do it. Why do we still want to put hope on them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are female watches? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distorted mentality made him more and more excessive about his daughter. If he could, he wouldn’t see his daughter again, it would only make him even more Painful and uncomfortable. He will not admit that he is an incompetent person. This is the fault of the world. It is the fault of the nobles. It is... his father's fault! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinissa, who used to have a tone and attitude like her father, didn’t care. She was more relaxed than ever before. She knows that she and her sister will soon become the new helm of the family, leading this distorted family to a new peak to retrieve the glory of the past, or to send them into hell. Their destiny will also become a pawn in her hands, contact with Doolin, and her sister's mockery let her begin to face up to her attitude towards the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, and her lovely sister don’t owe anything to this family. On the contrary, the family owes them too much, never heard of it. Because of which family has been excluded and targeted, it is necessary to let young women in the family go to socializing flowers and climb into other people's beds in exchange for family revitalization opportunities. But here, there is a hint of hatred in the heart that makes Dinissa of this matter have a different feeling, a feeling of excitement, facing these gloomy relatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled, the more she smiled, the sweeter she was, the more she hated her father and the elders. She didn’t care. "We got some things, and soon we will get the Imperial Central Bank." One share, this is what you have always wanted us to do. Now we have done it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This message instantly made all the people involved in the meeting The brain was blank, and the irrational stance of the last owner made their family unacceptable to the New Party, and the old party began to target them as "traitors." Their days were very difficult. Every nobleman is laughing at them and getting them into a situation of distress. They don't give them any chance, but at the same time they don't let them fall down completely. They watched them crawling on the ground like poor worms, looking for hope, and then stepping on their hopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, a hope of stepping on has emerged. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once they have shares in the Imperial Bank, they become shareholders of the Imperial Bank, they have the power to ask the Imperial Bank to invest in their industry, this is the empire The means by which the central bank invaded various industries in the early stage. They transfer the shares to the capitalists, then inject capital into the capitalist companies, and in another way seize some of the other industries to ensure that the imperial central bank continues to make progress. But this despicable approach has become a rope for life for the Hill family. As long as the funds of the imperial central bank flow into their industries, then those aristocratic consortia can no longer target them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consortiums are unlikely to face the Empire’s central bank, and the stronger the economy, the more sensitive it is to this, when the lion cannot evict wild dogs around them. When it means that the lion has lost the power to protect itself, the wild dogs will swarm until the lion becomes a corpse stain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe stood up excitedly, his eyes revealing enough to light the night, his plan succeeded, the Hill family is about to re-emerge, he Will also control this family and become an amazing person. Regardless of what evaluations will be given to him in the future genealogy, at least when he is alive, he will not live in humiliation, he will become a great figure in the scenery, and he will also get the life he dreamed of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great!...very good!", he waved his fist, walked back and forth a few steps, and sat down again, the whole body clung With the table, hands on the table, there is no decent nobility at all, and now I don't care about these things. "When can we get this part of the equity transfer? How much do we have to pay for this?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Di Nija had long been unable to bear the gaze of these people and their attitudes. They didn’t even care what their sisters had paid for this, they got the stake, they just wanted to take their things away and enslaved them. . She snorted and couldn't help but sneer, "We?", this sentence paused the atmosphere in the conference room for a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jov’s face instantly became gloomy, and the muscles on his cheekbones bounced uncontrollably due to intense emotional fluctuations, making him look awkward. "What do you mean by this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diniya shrugged, she used to do such a "female" movement, but this time of contact After Du Lin twice, she felt that it was very interesting to do so, and it would be very comfortable when necessary. "I don't mean anything, I just want to tell you the fact that those shares are things for me and my sister, not Anyone who belongs to you, understand? Cousin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jov looks at Dinesha, he knows that Denia is a bastard and a female watch. He is more convinced of his steady sister. "Tell me that she is just joking with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinissa is really calm, she has always kept a smile," Why? I think I said 'no' is the most correct decision, yes, we got the equity, but that Our stuff, no one can take it away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time when Joe wants to say something, the owner coughs, his expression is a bit strange, some complicated, But more is still hateful, he converges his own eyes and looks at the table, whispered, "This is different from what we said before. You are smart children, you should know what can be done, what can't be done, I said "Is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a new idea...", Dinissa’s voice calmed the room again, some little commotion It was completely still, her eyes swept over the faces of these relatives, and then said, "We can continue to follow the plan...", when she said this, Joe was relieved, but slightly There are some terrible things in my eyes. "But I think why the position of the owner should make an idiot to do it? A capable person is qualified to take the helm of the whole family. We should not give power to the most useless one." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp [&nbsp;Happy, less than three seconds later, Joe grabbed the glass next to the table and smashed it. He can tolerate a lot of things, but he can't tolerate the power of others. That is his power, not to mention the two women, his uncle, his father is not allowed. He has come up with many methods for this family. The facts also prove that his ideas have no problems. Now, in the season of harvest, these two bitches want to kick him out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
