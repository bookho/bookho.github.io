			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the quality of our engineering the same as the quality of the contractors outside?" Igor had a slightly different smile on his face, he was slightly lower Heading, licking his mouth, staring at his palm, then raised his head. "In fact, it is not to be able to come down, but it depends on your sincerity!" His eyes were involuntarily transferred to Na. Tally's legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the hottest season of the year, plus the feminist movement in the entire empire as the summer temperature, many women have become more wearable. Avant-garde, more bold. Natalie's dress is not really exposed, and even has nothing to do with the exposure. The only thing that can be exposed is the two round legs with healthy color. His gaze swept over Natalie's lap and his eyes flashed a stunning look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the director of the telegraph office, Igor has seen many women and tested their depths, but only one or two women are as good as this woman. . He has already passed the initial "hunting" stage. His own evaluation of himself is that the soul has been sublimated. Those ordinary women have been difficult to enter his vision. Only a woman like Natalie is in line with his current aesthetic. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First she was very temperamental, very beautiful, and very good in body. What made Igor feel satisfied was Natalie’s marriage. . He didn't know that Natalie was divorced, just guessing from the ring on her hand that the woman was married and had a family. According to her age, there should be children, all of which made Igor feel that his blood is burning and boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to converge on the greed of his own red fruit, smiling and looking at Natalie. When Natalie asked how to show sincerity, he said with a hint of temptation: "You are not saying that you have asked the contractors, they have a minimum price of 1.85 million? Yes, I I can give you the same price. After the end of our agreement, I can give you 50,000 after the money from Otis is remitted to my designated account."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"But you have to promise me a condition...", he licked his lips. "One week, one week, you can achieve the best results with the lowest price, you can earn 50,000, I I feel that this can reflect the sincerity of both of us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second Natalie changed her face, she was leaving with a cold face, Igor reached out After pulling her arm, the two men were beaten for a while, and Igor left in anger. Although he likes to make a different tone, it does not mean that he is willing to force others by force. He feels that this is just a transaction, and each needs it. The other party got an economic benefit, and he got the happiness that belongs to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that made him dissatisfied was that the woman didn't know much about it. He also put out the idea of ​​continuing to work with Natalie and Otis. Although it is a pity, but the money does not belong to him, he can not get much from it, so he does not care much about losing this business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natalie cried for a while, then took the noon steam locomotive, returned to the city of Otis, and appeared in Doolin’s office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has been listening very seriously, and asked a few small details, his fingers and fingers pointed together, elbows on the armrests of the chair I grinned and nodded. Then I stood up. "I think I already know all the things going through. I am very sorry for what you have encountered. This is my mistake. I should let people be with you." Go. Take a week off, adjust your mindset, and come back to work after a week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" As for the telephone network, you leave the contractor's phone Down, I will send someone to contact them.", Du Lin walked slowly to the door and opened the office door. "Nataly, do you believe that there is a god in this world?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natalie also stood up and shook her head slightly, "I don't know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she came At the door, Doolin stretched out his arms and made a hug. Natalie just hesitated, and gently and Du Linyong So what, less than five seconds time. In the five seconds, Du Lin gently patted her back to appease her some excitement, while whispering in her ear: "I believe the world is god, he is watching us. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin released Natalie and patted her arm. "Have a good rest. If you need it, you can go to other places to distract yourself." Come out of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Natalie disappearing into the hallway, Doolin walked back to the chair and meditated for a moment, then swayed a rope. He swears that he hates this stuff, which makes him feel like he has returned to decades ago, just like living in ancient times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short time, Hite knocked on the door and walked into the room with Doolin’s permission. He took off his hat and carried it under his arm. "Boss, are you looking for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took out a cigarette box and lost a past. Hetton was suddenly slap in the face of surprise, and he almost did not respond. In a hurry, he finally caught the cigarette, but the police cap fell to the ground. The balance badge on the brim symbolizing the imperial justice was stained with some dust and not so bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You did a good job a few days ago. To be honest, I didn't think you had such an idea. It's good. I always think that everyone should have their own. The thoughts and opinions, only then can we continue to grow and develop. If everyone is just a machine to execute orders, we may not be as far away as we imagined!" He said that the elderly amputated This is not what he told, but the decision that Hite made himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that Du Lin will not feel that the following people have passed his will, which will only make him more happy. Any organization that wants to grow up must first have a collective consciousness and at the same time have an individual consciousness. In important matters, individual consciousness must obey the overall consciousness, but in some small things, Du Lin believes that it still needs a little individual consciousness to exist and behave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the reasons why he came to Otis with only the Buddha. In his idiots, only Buddha is the most self-conscious person. When he confesses that Buddhism is going to do something, he only needs to tell him the purpose, and he will solve it himself. But other people, he must tell them what to do, and then they go to perform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin is now an emperor, the leader of a huge force, the number of people under his hand is thousands, tens of thousands, he hopes to have more like Airlie As a bastard, but he is not, so people like Buddha are even more important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood up and walked to Heite’s side. He could see that the guy was a little nervous. One hand pressed on the shoulder of Hite, a little hard Knocked, the other hand took out the lighter and ignited the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing now?" Du Lin asked a question like a gossip. He went to the window and pushed open the window, outside the window. The heat wave made him feel so suffocated for a moment. This ghost place and the damn town hall building have no internal cooling function, the walls are solid, and there are no copper pipes with rolling ice and flowing ice water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s hotter outside, it’s as unbearable as an oven, without opening the window every once in a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hite never found the original cigarette so fascinating, charming to his eyes squinting to feel the refreshing sensation of his hair when the smoke rose from the surface of his skin. When Du Lin asked, he immediately widened his eyes, and some replied with a smile: "The Buddha is sleeping all these days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Linyi Hey, laugh out loud, "Let the bastard come to see me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Du Lin without the following, Hite nodded hard, this time he remembered The police cap on the ground patted the less obvious dust and put it on his head. "I know, I will inform him immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Du Lin lifted his hand and moved his finger. Heite turned and left, and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin turned back and looked at the flowing figures on the street outside the window, long sighed, this damn ghost city, finally different It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very fast, the police station is actually on the first floor of the city hall, and his face is still lying with no tiredness. Yawning on the sofa, picking a crust from the fruit basket on the coffee table and taking a bite. The lack of moisture in the apple is far from the taste of the apple on the side of Irian. There is a little bit of it, and there is a bit of awkwardness. After eating two, he is thrown into the trash can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you are sleeping all these days?", Du Lin still stood by the window, looking at the Buddha sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha scratched his head. "Well, I don’t know why I always want to sleep every time I am locked up." He said he yawned. “What do I need to do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin went to the table and Natalie left the contact information of the two contractors on a piece of paper. On the article, he took the note and walked to the side of the Buddha to sit down and handed it to him. "Contact, let them bid, and by the way, Igor of the Nano Lindes Telegraph Office will get it back to me." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Buddha took a look at the note and put it in his pocket, he asked a little curiously, "Okay, I know you won’t let me rest for a long time. "He patted his cheek a few times. "These days are the most comfortable days I have ever had in the past two years. If there is a chance, then shut me in!", he said with his hands on his knees. Get up, "Right, Hite raised the leader?" After he said, he shook his head and smiled. "The guy saw me and smiled, I know!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
