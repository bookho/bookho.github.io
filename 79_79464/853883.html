			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man said this when all the onlookers around him suddenly had a sense of epic madness in their hearts, their mayor actually Is it a smuggler, and the biggest smuggler on the East Coast of the Empire? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, this is really hard to accept, on the one hand is the mayor, the ruler of a city, the manager. On the one hand, it is a smuggler, a dangerous person who treats the law as drinking water. It's hard to combine these two identities, but their mayor did it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, some people suddenly realized that it is no wonder that Mayor Du Lin will issue tax receipts to those smugglers. He was also one of them. Some even think of how the mayor of Doolin came in. Maybe it was these smugglers who made up the money to get through the joints and let him jump from a smuggler to a mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this city where there is no police station to maintain the level of law and order, it is very clear or not. When young people pointed out the identity of Doolin, they had a subtle mood for Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy did bring changes to the city, but his identity made everyone feel a bit unacceptable, which is a very contradictory psychology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverse view of Doolin, he was not angry because he was publicly known because of his identity, but his face showed a smile, he observed the young man, the young man also Let him observe it in a big way. He asked: "I don't know your name yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to investigate me?", the young man followed and laughed. "My name is Martin." You are welcome to investigate and investigate all of my affairs clearly. Maybe you can find something that I may have forgotten or don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Martin!", Dooling nodded. "I remember this name!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am honored, sir."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin crossed Martin for a few steps forward. He now clearly feels that someone is targeting him. Exposing his details is only their first step. Their real purpose should be It is the mid-term election. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister’s term of office is four years and lasts for a maximum of two terms, so people always regard the point between the first four years and the second four years as half of the term, which is what people say. Mid-term election. However, in a strict sense, the term of office is only four years. In the first four years, there will always be some people who are benefited by the policies and regulations promulgated by the Prime Minister. The beneficiaries are often more than the victims, so the vested interests will Resolutely vote for the person who is currently in power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the following people, there is no concept of "interim elections" because their terms of office are unrestricted and unregulated. Every four years is a general election for them, and they are all a rigorous test. The exam passed, and everything is no different from the past. But if you can't pass the exam, you may have to face the loss and lose your power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this step is taken, it is not a dead end. It can be transferred to other places with strong party power, or to hold positions within the party, waiting for the next time. opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the development of the city of Otis showing a strong change in the past month, Du Lin has long been willing to pick peaches. It is normal to take the fruits of his victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a big deal to make a bustling city more prosperous, but if you develop a poor place in the post-Roman into a bustling city, it means Political and word-of-mouth success means more opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plus Du Lin’s rules of nature for the city are sufficient to allow any person to serve as mayor without affecting the city’s continued development. So some people are tempted. They only need to get the position of Doolin, and then continue to develop in the way of Doolin, it is not difficult to create a bustling city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, my city is going to be taken away by you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s heart was a cold chill, and he looked at the onlookers and observed the changes on their faces. After a moment, he nodded. "I am here, in front of everyone's face, I need to refute Mr. Martin's wrong view. He said that I am a smuggler, I don't admit it." When Martin was just about to say something, He looked back at Martin and his indifferent eyes made Martin's heart burst, without interrupting Doolin's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compared to the not so good name of smugglers, I prefer to let people call me a businessman. At the same time, I must explain that my business is legal in Irian. My business is very big, how big is it? "", he stretched his arms to the side, seems to want to embrace the whole world, "has such a big!", the sudden little humor effect is very good, so many people laugh out loud, and even some people directly to the side People express their opinions. They think that Du Lin is a good person, at least he can make everyone happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was also very satisfied with his rescue behavior. He smiled and continued: "I provide 600,000 bottles of wine to Empire 5 each month." In 17 cities, after each bottle of wine has been allotted, including taxation, I will earn three yuan, one month is 1.8 million, and one year is more than 20 million. I earn one month a month. It may be higher than the tax payment in the city of Otis. Why should I come here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When Mr. Martin pointed out my identity, I I believe many people will think that I am here to make more money, but this is not the purpose of my visit here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the mayor of Irian When I nominate me to be the mayor, I refused from the heart, because I didn't know the place before then, then I went to see the map. I found this place on the map, and my The assistant also told me that this place is a poor place, so poor that I have a monthly income top here for a year or even longer. Taxation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was very opposed at the time, compared to the mayor who was only a few old cars, people still riding horses, why don't I Continue to do my business? Every day, I can go out with the girls you can't imagine, and find the happiness you can't imagine on the sea. I can spend money to buy anything I want to buy, I can enjoy it. Why do I have to come here as the Emperor’s Majesty?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the citizens around, and the citizens were gradually being impromptu by him. Attracted, because the things he said are true, they are all real, not the things that the politicians can't understand. At the same time, people are also thinking about why such a rich man who has the happiness they can't imagine, why come here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hit a ring and pointed to the sky. This finger pulled some people’s thoughts back and put their attention back on Doolin’s body. "Because I found another kind of fun, a fun of challenge. There is only one person I respect the most, that is the leader of our new party, our leader, Mr. Magus, who saved the empire and saved us all. He can save me, then why can't I make money with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To tell the truth, the guy who nominated me here is not kind. He just wants to send me away. He is afraid that I will participate in the election and take him down from the position of the mayor. So he sent me here, in They are here a garbage dump. Everyone who has no value lives here. It is dead and there is no future. Because their evaluation of this place is so special, I suddenly think this may make sense." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came here, and led everyone to make a fortune, even when I first arrived, I wanted to lead everyone to do business with me. "He pointed to Martin, "that is, the smugglers he said in his mouth..." and then pointed to himself, "I am a smuggler who can earn millions in a month."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizens have a fanatical look in their eyes after the horror. They don’t ask for more than one million in a month. As long as there are more than one hundred, they are enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at these hot, sun-like eyes, Doolin laughed and laughed, nothing could make people swing their will more than their interests. . They want to kick themselves away unless they can promise anything like him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I soon discovered that there is a simpler and more profitable way to do smuggling here, why should we abandon the immediate profit to go further? Looking for an uncertain future?", Du Lin took two steps and pointed to the ground and said: "In the eyes of others, here is a garbage dump, but in my eyes, here is the gold mine. It is not anything that is difficult for Otis. People, but ideas, and desires for change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will make this place a lot of money, I will make this a pearl of the middle of the empire, Even the most lively and bustling city in the entire empire. But before that, you must support every policy of mys. Only when we cooperate with each other can I bring you the changes you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After these words, Du Lin looked at those who did not want to move, and made a decision on the spot, "Do you want more compensation fees? Yes!", he said When they said this, those people suddenly showed their joy, including Martin. Difficult to detect a hint of a smile on his face fleeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Du Lin made such a decision, he was able to encourage more people to follow up, so that he was just on the right track and a virtuous circle of urban finances. Will be ruined by him. At that time, Doolin must be responsible, if someone stands up in the party and blames him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
