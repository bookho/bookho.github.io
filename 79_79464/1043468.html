			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have some things to talk about with Du Lin...", watching Du Lin’s false and false, and the father and son have a lot of experience, Ma Gus decisively ordered the order. He knows that Doolin is not flustered by both Donald and his son. There may even be some bad ideas. Instead of letting the two guys continue to speed up Dulin's emotional fermentation here, let them leave early. At least Du Lin can't see, and attention will not be placed on these two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Magus has a very rich experience, he is always able to smoothly forget some of the "invisible" things, he is a Very busy people, Du Lin is the same, people like them put more energy into things that are more important to themselves, such small things as Donald, if they don’t provoke Du Lin, they don’t continue to appear in Du Around the forest, Doolin will not take care of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steward sent away Donald and the door, and now is the real time for conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I ate the vegetables you sent, and I have to say that the harmless vegetables you make are really different.", Magus Nadu Lin has been busy with things for a while as a starting point for chatting. This is not a kind of accommodation. Some people think that taking things that others are good at or more specialized is the entry point of the topic, and they will lose their initiative in the topic. Start chatting with things that happen to you or what you do best. They don't know if the people who are chatting with them know what they mean by the things they say, or they don't even know what they are talking about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to relax your speech, you must first relax your emotions. People like Magus or Doolin have an extraordinarily strong Self-confidence, I use your things as an entry point to start chatting, I still have the confidence to finally grasp the initiative of the topic firmly in my own hands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled. "It’s pollution-free, not harmless. If you want to express this word thoroughly, you may have to say it for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus waved his hand and leaned back on the back of the sofa. "A lot of things can’t be remembered when I’m older, no pollution..., hey, I’m fighting for it. Remember," he laughed at himself. "In fact, I was very surprised. I thought that you would do something else. How do you think of farming and animal husbandry? This is not the same as Dulin I have in mind." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin gradually relaxed, and he asked, "Oh? How do you feel about me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus reveals a thoughtful expression, slightly With his head tilted, the index finger of his left hand curled up against his chin. "Young, full of anger, there is a desire to challenge authority, I want to prove myself to everyone... In fact, there are still some, just not searching for a time. So many words, in general, in my impression you should be a fire, not the person who is engaged in this pension industry, this is not for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Agriculture and animal husbandry has always been regarded as a pension industry, because the risk of agriculture and animal husbandry is the smallest of all industries, and the profit is not high, but it is not low. Whether it is the imperial central bank or the poker organization, or other large consortia or group companies, the farm branch often appears in their assets, especially the two huge economies of the imperial central bank and poker. The farm can be said to be theirs. The foundation, because the farm is an industry that makes a steady profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ordinary individuals or ordinary companies, it is not a good idea to engage in farms. The investment is big and the return is slow. It is better to invest money in other returns. High but in areas that need to bear certain risks. But for large economies, farms are the best option, and stable returns and low risks don't have to put too much thought on it, and they can also lay a large piece of land. In some areas that encourage farming and animal husbandry to cover the farms and pastures, it is also a disguised land investment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also makes people think that this kind of risk-stable and stable project on the farm is a pension industry. In the mind of Magus, Du Lin is a very The ambitious person, and he has a daunting execution, he thought that Du Lin would build a mine-like industry in the crazy enclosure of the west, and set up his first private arming through such an industry. According to the standards of the two hundred mine protection team members in each mining area, only need to get twenty or thirty mines, he can pull up a group of private armed forces of no less than 5,000 or even 10,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Maggs has been watching him, but he really didn’t expect Du Lin to go to the farm, not only to solve the employment problem in the west, It seems that I am going to take root in the west. What did he think? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggs did not fail to take into account that Du Lin would use the power of these people to influence the outcome of the election year, which has long been in the rest of the empire. The capitalists played out. They controlled the electoral elections through the power of the capitalists to control their jobs, thus sending their spokespersons to the political arena, interfering with normal policy implementation and taking crazy interests for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this, Magus has changed his initial plan. He decided to support the tenant's dominance in the west and further expand the influence of the doormen. No matter whether Du Lin will become the governor after three years, he needs to face a problem. This problem is called a doorman. The doorman lost the support of the bloody dawn. He was like an old dog without a minion. He had no second way to go except for the new party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the doorman will, as he or the cabinet asks, be as politically as possible to block the development of Doolin, and Magus also believes Du Lin must have seen these futures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Maggs has been unable to understand. If Doolin sees these things, why is he still going to get the farm? He found himself targeting The traps and strategies he placed in the west, or did he really want to engage in agriculture? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggs couldn’t understand, it was because he couldn’t understand, he was worried, and Du Lin’s past achievements were a very “floating” The young man is not talking about his character, but his means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time, there is no way to go down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time, even if the situation is difficult, don’t give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggs knows that Doolin has magical ideas to help him out of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he was very worried that this time Du Lin’s farm was his previous trick, and he made everyone stunned and watched him go to the next one. Steps. This method is very old-fashioned, he used it many times, but it also shows the effectiveness of this method. For politics, the more successful the precedent is and the one that has not been cracked, the more valuable it is, the old one is not important! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Du Lin very seriously, looked at the changes in Mu Lin’s face, looked at his eyes, and watched his eyes stretch out. Shooting the light, he wants to know what Du Lin is going to do! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I...", Du Lin laughed. He took a bite of the pizza on the table. These should be the wife of Magus who hosted Donald. What the father and son did was just bite down and he regretted it. He put the pancake on the plate. "It's still as delicious as before." He clap his hands and continue. "In fact, my current thoughts are very simple. The officialdom is too complicated. It is easy for me to be impulsive." It is not appropriate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They don't like me, I don't like them either too!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since we can't appreciate each other, why should we continue to hurt each other?" I am not keen on power. On the contrary, after I went to the west, I found a good business opportunity. In the past few years, I have planned to sink my temper, do well, patiently do something, business things.", Du Lin took out a cigarette and handed it to Magus. He took the initiative and bent over to pick it up, then sat back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a sip of smoke and spit smog, and asked, "Mr. Maggs, do you know how I told the capitalists in the West?" Magus shook his head. He actually knew, but he couldn't show that he had been staring at Doolin, even if Doolin knew it. Du Lin showed a bit of a glaring smile. "I told them that making money is something that every capitalist is pursuing, but while pursuing benefits, we should also assume more social responsibilities and have a conscience. I have a social responsibility and a capitalist who abides by the law. I call this capitalist a patriotic businessman. What I have to do is to establish a model and tell others that this road will work!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, this is also a way and path to change some of the status quo, what do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a very vulgar word suddenly in the heart of Magus. He smiled and nodded his head, and his face was gratified. "It's good. The two words you use are very accurate, socially responsible, and patriotic businessmen. This is something to be encouraged, how, is there anything I need to help you with this old man? Although I can't interfere with local policies, but for you A few good words are still possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, this is what I should do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Du Lin’s shameless look, Magus suddenly felt a toothache. The bastard was really a jerk. He smiled and talked about another topic. “I saw this morning. Newspaper, the newspaper said that you and a female star, called...", Magus suddenly frowned and stopped to express, Du Lin reminded him a little, he nodded and continued, "Yes, called Frey Na's female star looks very close?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Actually I like young people like you very much. Please forgive me for saying that you may not like to listen very rudely. I think that this girl is not suitable for your wife's candidate. She can't help you in career. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
