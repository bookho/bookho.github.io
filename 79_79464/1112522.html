			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first few days, Xien also felt that this was definitely not a problem. He had been the top leader of the local bureau and had been a rich life experience of prisoners. Is it not a simple matter to find a job in the west to support yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality gave him a mouth in a timely manner, letting him understand how cruel the society is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first job he applied for was a courier for pizza and snacks in the ring. In addition to a commission of fifteen points for each order, The tip is his personal. According to his algorithm, at least eight orders can be sent every day, which already has more than one dollar, plus the consumption given by the guests, all add up to two dollars. In the relatively backward place in the west, the two dollars are enough to spend the day, and there is extra money. It is not a problem to support themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several foreigners who have been employed by the immigrants to come to the empire. Each one is a pure look of a face, referred to as silly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment before seeing the interviewer in the restaurant is the boss and the cook, he feels that this time is stable, he has too many advantages, the most important one It is his identity, he is an imperial person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, as mentioned above, the reality gave him a slap in time, so that he could not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was eliminated because he didn’t look like a good person and had a prison experience. The restaurant didn’t want a person like this to take delivery, that would Affect the image of the restaurant and lose more customers. Second, and most importantly, those immigrants only need eight cents a single, and these people give the restaurant more security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to have nothing to do with the so-called sense of security, but in fact these immigrants pay attention to their identity and information, and now basically all immigrants During the inspection period, once someone complained about them, they had a great influence on their status as residents of the empire. This raises the safety of restaurants occasionally deducting their wages for a number of reasons, and their lower wages. Choosing these immigrants who can be controlled is what Western small and medium-sized enterprises are most willing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not impossible to hire imperial citizens to work, but these people are uncles, maybe they will complain to the restaurant to squeeze their labor, so why choose An imperial man with criminal and prison experience? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Xiu En was defeated and inexplicably lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he found several jobs, and each job will have some immigrants as competitors. Every time he becomes a stepping stone for those immigrants. After the successful interview, the success was lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time, two times, three times, gradually meditation understands that this society is no longer the society of the past, although there is still a large shortage of labor in the society as a whole. There are also some outstanding problems. He does not know how to summarize these problems, but he feels the existence of the problems. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this has the same problem for many countries with population introduction systems, the contradiction between cheap labor and high-priced labor, and the attitude of exploitation by workers, It is doomed that there will be a great imbalance in the employment of countries with more migrants. On the one hand, they are willing to be oppressed and willing to be exploited. They are willing to accept unfair treatment and exchange for a right to reside. Life and quality are more like a hope for the future. Today's contribution is for the enjoyment of tomorrow. It is precisely because of this ideal that they are willing to do a lot of things that their natives are not willing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In turn, look at the imperial people, they need a better working environment, more in line with the minimum hourly wages required by law, and organizations such as workers’ unions. Provide them with all kinds of assistance. When capitalists use these people, they will be very embarrassed. If they use them, they will be very reassured. After all, there are many skilled workers, but then there are many series of troubles, all kinds of experience and various rights and interests. And so on, sometimes the capitalists are instead controlled by these workers and workers' unions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has not yet shown obvious bipolar contradictions, some places have already appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Xiu’s understanding of society is not enough to find out the problems. He just feels that it is very difficult to find a job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next period of time, Xiuen constantly searched for new jobs, and finally only actively reduced his salary requirements, and told his employers that he did not have a family. The drag, it is entirely possible to help the company do what it can at the weekend, and then got a job... sewer work. Yes, clean up the sewer sludge, the daily wages add up to only 80, and there are four hours of free overtime on weekends. The money is not enough for him to guarantee his life in the west. Now the quality of Xiu Enlian is not strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
