			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are asking you to buy, and there is a big gap between you and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not Arthur George and the people behind him who are eager to separate and cut from the main house, they may not be so anxious to buy resources from Juan’s hands. . They can wait any longer. It doesn't take long. After one or two months, the price will be hundreds of thousands less. In a month or two, it is not necessarily enough to earn hundreds of thousands. It is not a problem. The reason why Arthur was so happy to promise Juan's request, indeed, as Du Lin said, they are racing against time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, they can't wait! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows if the old man who is not managing things is still alert, or is already confused. In case he discovered their "small tricks", perhaps their investment and efforts during this time will become the old-fashioned meal. Be aware that whatever resources they use, or the funds they take out, are strictly the property of John, and what he buys with his property is of course John's. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just played a ghost trick, first registered a company, and then the money went from the old John's account, but the ownership of the thing was transferred to the new company. This may have violated some legal issues, but if you don't report it, who has the heart to actively interfere with the furniture scandal of the wealthy family? This is not a leisurely day, it’s too good, is there nothing to look for? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that these people are not very clear. John, who is already very old, has some "kindness". He is not confused, just wants to take advantage of this opportunity. I completely cut off these malignant tumors from my body. He hopes that their plans will succeed more than those brothers and sisters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, an eager to sell, an anxious to buy, both sides hit it off, and immediately someone brought an authorization file and other documents to come to Irian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Juan saw this lawyer who had met before, there was a moment of embarrassment, he put away his self-pity, calm Sitting on the edge of the table, the pen in his hand shivered slightly, indicating that he was not as calm as his performance at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can remain calm at this moment, as long as his pen tip falls on it and signs his name, then from this moment, he tens The efforts of the year will be turned into nothing, and he will return to the moment he just started his business. He is old. I don't know if there are decades to let him come back. Everything will say goodbye to him on this day. It is not a new beginning, but an end to the end! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can not drop the pen, stubbornly think that he did not lose, but he understands that he is losing after all. Just as Doolin came to visit him that day and wanted to buy these lines from his hands, he could only blame himself at first, if not for his own greed, he wanted to take his business from Doolin... ..., if it weren't for him that he wanted to swallow the pie that was painted on the ground, if he didn't have so much selfishness, maybe he wouldn't fall into this step! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s good, or I’m too greedy, and I’m left behind. He only hates being blinded by greed and hates that he’s not seeing Dulin’s. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the lawyer’s hidden urging, Juan closed his eyes and signed his name on the transfer instrument. From this moment, he The efforts, the accumulation of decades, and the future that can be expected have turned into water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s a little wet, his turbid yellowed eyes are slightly red, he took the bank’s promissory note from the lawyer’s hand, and endured heartache and bitterness. With a smile, "Are you satisfied with this time? With just a little money, you bought millions of things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer carefully checked Hu After Ann's signature, the documents were properly packed in a file bag and placed in a briefcase. He shrugged his shoulders. "This is business, Mr. Juan, if we are satisfied, you must be satisfied, or why should you sell it?", he breathed a sigh of relief, the perfect task is to win "I don't think you are going to say goodbye to me, then goodbye, Mr. Juan, let me take a step!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the empty room, Juan wants I vented it, but in the end I was sitting in a chair, and he had nothing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The George’s bank draft has no problem with the bank’s exchange of more than one million copies into Juan’s account, which is intended to be taken from the bank. It is not enough to return to his industry. Fortunately, he has his own plan. He doesn't want anything like villas, homes, cars or even bars. As long as he has a winemaking workshop, he only has the opportunity to turn over if he has wine in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, he was not willing to sell his drinks to other places. First, transportation increased costs and risks, and secondly, the investment and risk of exploiting the foreign market were more Big, but not much. He can't have his own retail outlets in every city in the empire, which is destined that he can only go wholesale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wholesale business is not so good, for example, the most common problem of pressure, he does not have so much energy to stare at the money to ask him, he is old, no energy. Compared to wholesales filled with too many uncertainties, he is willing to do retail locally. Although it seems that there is no wholesale to pay more, it can be stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, every year, Juan can get at least 500,000 to 600,000 profits from his own bar and local sales, for him This is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, after he got his workshop back, he not only had to sell locally, but also to open the foreign market, smuggling, and rushing. "The old guy is no longer a problem that prevents him from stepping forward." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not need Doolin to let James do anything, Juan took the initiative to tell James that he could not pay off the bank’s loan, and the bank could put those things into the auction process. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if he has money, he won’t do it, but the problem is that he has no money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Du Lin meeting less than ten days, the Imperial Central Bank’s Irian branch sent an invitation to the rich people in Irian’s city to invite them. Only the auction of expired collateral is added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of auction is not a lot, sometimes it can't be held once a year, and there are not many opportunities to invite local rich people like this. In many cases, the value of those collaterals is not enough for the bank to invite the rich to come and not to lose that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Du Lin was also one of the invited guests at the auction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He changed a white dress, black shirt, which made him look younger and a little more than the dark clothes. Sharp. He didn't wear a hat, and his hair was followed by a double "care" of waxing and oiling. This kind of dulin seems to have something different from the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gate of the auction venue was slowly pushed away by Dudu, and Du Lin walked in with a head-on, and some people’s conversations suddenly stagnated. If there is anyone who doesn't know Du Lin, then he must have lived in the mountains, or just came to Irian. In just one year, Du Lin used his financial resources to conquer these rich people. Of course, there are some private rumors. Whether it is something that can be used, or those who can't get it, he is a man of the moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantly, the rich people toasted to Du Lin, and Du Lin also nodded. He was like... No, he was a high-ranking figure, and he walked to the top of the auction with a step full of discouragement and oppression. Some people want to say a few words to Du Lin. He has temporarily avoided it with very polite words. Compared with this, he is more like seeing Juan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Juan is talking to the rich man like Alexander, who wears a black dress, a white shirt, a bow tie, and a pocket on his chest. There is also a red handcuff in it. If it weren't for the embarrassment on his face, perhaps he couldn't see from the outside what he had changed. He is ventilating with these rich people, hoping that they can understand themselves and not raise the price when they are auctioning in the brewery workshop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His request is not excessive. After all, these people and him are old friends for more than ten years or even decades, and there is no old feud. Hate, and Juan just wants to get back to his own industry. For them, the purpose of participating in this auction is not necessarily to get what they want at the auction. It is better to say that they are taking the opportunity to get together, chat, and talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when people talked about something, they suddenly closed their mouths, and Juan browed and slowly looked back and glanced back. . The original smile on his face was like the ice rim in the cold winter, with a cold light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Don't you welcome me?", Du Lin smiled very happy, and he also took the initiative to reach out, "Welcome back, Juan."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan glanced at his outstretched hand and turned back without expression, as if he did not see Du Lin. Du Lin was not annoyed at this. He shrugged his shoulders and greeted others. These people quickly dissipated after responding to Du Lin, and staying here will inevitably cause trouble. Obviously, the contradiction between Du Lin and Juan has already heated up. At this time, he can only be offended by one of them, or two people are offended together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one around, Juan is looking for a place to sit down nearby, he does not intend to say a word with Du Lin, sometimes the wishes of people All are good, the only drawback is that it can't be achieved. He didn't want to talk to Du Lin, but Du Lin wanted to talk to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know? When you refused me, I decided to sue you. Sometimes people often point to us that the rich people say that money is not a panacea. But today, I want to tell you the truth, money, this thing is omnipotent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
