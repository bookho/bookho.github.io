			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days later, three more people fell into Eric's trap, bringing Dolly an ultra-high return of 110,000. If you don't think Eric is a guy who can't help it, Du Lin is really reluctant to give up such a person. In fact, many people will lie, a small lie, big enough to deceive millions of fraud cases, but the real liar is not easy to find. They must first be able to deceive themselves, and secondly they must have sufficient psychological capacity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you just say a lie, you may feel any psychological burden, but let a liar's lies and traps add up, let many people go bankrupt or even jump off the building. When you commit suicide, you face a corpse that has lost your life. When you face the criticism of public opinion, you can still laugh at your life as a qualified liar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin got up from the bed and pressed the alarm that almost picked up. He licked his hair and went to the bathroom. It was not very comfortable to sleep this afternoon. Because I haven't slept well, I am awakened by the alarm. Before he took a nap, he didn't plan to rest. He couldn't do anything when he sat down. He finally lay in bed. The hot water made him feel very comfortable. After a simple bath, he changed into a very decent dress with the help of the maid. He put on his hat and took the stick and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savi They took the boat at 2 o'clock in the afternoon to Irian, and Doolin was going to pick them up. People who have never been a sea boat can hardly imagine that the sea looks very stable, but when you are sitting on a boat, you can feel the constant bumps and shakes, even without the reference objects and the layers of waves, even It will give people a feeling of retreating from the boat. When Buddha came to spit, it was impossible to spit out. No one was picking them up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further said that these people can come to Du Lin from such a distant place to leave their hometown and relatives, why not pick them up in person? Du Lin always believes that the maintenance of feelings is two-sided, and each need to pay to maintain the feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for about twenty minutes, I sent two people to see a technical woman’s conversation and a preparation to spend a night exploring the origin of the universe. After the female tourist, she finally saw a huge passenger liner coming from the sea level. The five-story passenger liner has made Du Lin feel that this is a huge monster, but he heard that when the imperial military port docked a more horrific warship, when it was bigger than the mountain, it was impossible to imagine the oppression of the warship. sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt that if he had the chance, he would have to look at it and see what it feels like a mountain collided with himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin felt that the group of kids might not find themselves, and they couldn’t find them, they saw a group of boys under the escort of the crew. Walk down the ramp. Du Lin greeted him with a smog, and Savi, who was bored when he saw Du Lin coming over, couldn't help but jump. He jumped and waved his hands and shouted "here." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this your friend or family?" When they walked down the ramp, a white gang couldn’t help but complain. God, I really can't stand it. If they want to take a passenger ship next time, trouble you or assign one or two adults to look at them, you can't imagine..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;############################################################################################################### /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big face suddenly showed a big smile, he even wanted to touch Savi’s head, but it was a pity that he was hiding. “I never saw It’s really awesome to have such a lively child, I hope to receive you and these great guys next time!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his hand and pinched the round cap I lifted it a little, and left the shore as a child king surrounded by a group of half-sized boys. Everything here made the group feel fresh. A total of eleven people came in. In addition to the five small players of Savage’s stormtroopers, there were three boys and three girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you must have been very impressed by the mate, telling what you have done?", Du Lin’s smile on his face There is no stop, only when he is with this group of familiar people, he can laugh so sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savi is a little embarrassed, but the little black rushed to say it. "The first time we took such a big boat, we must definitely see it everywhere, that The mate and other crew members are really not good people. Many places don't allow us to go in! They are really too bad!" Some friends also nod their heads, but let Du Lin have a feeling of crying and laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just like this, the great-minded gentleman almost said that he wouldn’t take their passenger liner next time, but he can understand that after all, these children only have ten One or two years old, it is the time when you are active and active, and the most inquiring about the outside world. Coupled with Savi, the captain of the stormtroopers, these guys are certainly lawless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, Doolin took them to the front of the dock and then returned to the manor. The first time I saw such a bustling city, my friends could hardly use their eyes. When they arrived at the manor, they were a little calmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From today on, you will live in this city, so there is time for you to visit the city. It is different from Tener. Politics in the city of Tener is absolutely unique, but here the economy is the dominant one, so all our actions may be different from before." Du Lin said this to remind them Young boys and girls have different rules of survival in different cities and have different rules of the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has not yet touched the management of the city, but he has gradually mastered some of the rules of living in this city, that is, the economy. The economy, or money, is the core law of the city. If you can make a great contribution, even if it is a bit too much, the group of managers will not see it. This may be the difference between the city where the New Party is in power and the city where the old party is in power. The New Party is more interested in building and development, and the Old Party wants everyone to listen to their own words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have a rest today, and you will go out and get acquainted with the city tomorrow. I will need you to do things after three days." Du Lin finished speaking and let Jose give They sent two hundred dollars a person. Compared to Savvy's calm, the other little guys seemed to be overwhelmed. They didn't know if they should take the money. If they took it, they should take it. They have never seen so much money in their lives, and the joy and confusion in their hearts are inevitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there is Savi’s role model, and a large stack of twenty denominations of banknotes into the pockets, made a good job for these little friends. Role model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calm, peaceful Irian is as perfect as she is on the surface, as if there is no place in the city to hide dirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abiden did not immediately announce the dissolution after dinner with his companions, but went to the lawn in the park in the fifth district and sat down. . He looked at the five companions around him and organized the language. He said in a very low voice: "Our enemy is very powerful. He is very rich. It is the upper class of Irian. To be honest, I am worried. I am worried that some compatriots will suffer. Live the temptation, go to work for him, then disappear into the city, be sold to a remote place to become a slave, or spend the rest of the life in a cave!", he sighed with sigh, "we I have to think of a way, even if I can't get rid of him, let him not be able to persecute our compatriots!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
