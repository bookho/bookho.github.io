			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nomi菈’s performance is very strong, too much to show his professionalism, Du Lin can understand the way people behave, and understand the little people The pity, he maintained an attitude of approval throughout the whole process, so that Nomi felt that being enlightened by Kevin was not only pleasant but also pleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the dinner, Nomi’s excuse was to take a step in the first place, and he also bite his teeth and settled the bill. The dining expenses of any high-end restaurant are not imaginable to the average person. It is definitely an astronomical number. The money for this meal is almost enough for Nomi's three-month salary. Of course, it is only wages, not all income. As a government official, there will always be some inexplicable income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nomi left Alice after leaving, and Du Lin looked at the red-faced girl like a big lobster in a steamer and picked up a napkin. I licked my lips and took a sip with a glass of wine. He was well aware of the ideas of Nomi and the little girl. He looked at the little girl and said with a smile, "This is not the best choice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Directly point out this statement, this is definitely not the best choice, because so far, Du Lin has a lot of troublesome things that have not been resolved. It’s not a good thing to have a deep relationship with him. Perhaps for now, it may bring some convenience and good response, but from a long-term perspective, this is definitely not a good thing. Before Doolin did not get into the core circle, all those who had a close relationship with him would stop before the last step of the tower, and unless Du Lin himself made a breakthrough, these people could take it to the next level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, Alice’s little girl is not clear what Du Lin wants to say. She is still very young and has just graduated from school for more than a year in the government. There are too few experiences in the department, and I can't interpret Du Lin's deeper meaning. She only knows that this is an opportunity, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. If she can't catch it, she is not sure if she will regret it now, but she will regret it later. From the gaze of her boss, and the occasional complaints of Nomi, on the weekdays, the girl understood a truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A female character who wants to be on the official stage and in the political arena must have a strong character behind him, otherwise he can only be obscured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl raised her courage and looked up at Du Lin. "Mr. Doolin, I will send you back..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin grinned and glanced at the little girl. "Remember, this is your choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are some invisible in many industries. The rules, when you are pulling when everyone is eating, then you will be angry with everyone. Only when everyone is eating together, is it fragrant. You can't debunk this lie, because this is the fact under the rules. Whoever makes unforgivable things, whoever is the sinner of all, will be rejected, isolated, and will not accomplish anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big bribes or friendships, some people regard this as a hidden rule, and its existence is necessarily reasonable. Du Lin started from breaking the rules from the beginning, and now he began to maintain the rules. He has never changed, but his status is different, so he has different choices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can refuse, but this will make Nomi suspicious, and then guess whether Du Lin has any prejudice against her, or does not like her. I have had some troubles in my life and work, and I naturally guessed whether Du Lin gave her a scorpion and would not warn her. In the end, in her own cranky thoughts, she went to another position, one extreme, and became an enemy with Doolin, even though Du Lin had not done anything but refused in the whole process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if Doolin accepts, Nomi will be able to work hard and continue to work closely with Doolin. Dooling did not care about the extent to which Nomi was able to put his work in the limit. He cares about a fait accompli. Some people rely on Doolin and Doolin accepts her. This is like a signal, Du Lin is no longer exclusive, Du Lin represents no longer a small group of people, he finally matured, know how to unite more people, the benefits of the hand is assigned to more More groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sisters of the Hill family are, Natiya is, and Nomi is also, the niche can only be the limit in a small area, but Can not achieve the limits of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice, who followed Doolin back to the villa, was full of curiosity about everything here, and Doolin was as admirable as her in her eyes. She vaguely remembers that she had planned to fire her for a moment, and she could decide the future of her life, the head of the department, Nomi, who was very strong in her life, and carefully politely sent Du Lin away from the coffee shop. Just now, Nomi菈 is like saying that he is reporting for the leadership. He keeps saying that there is no detail, and that Du Lin is just um, or nod, which is enough to satisfy Nomi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he can say a word or two for sure, Nomi's face can laugh out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person like this must have something different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the next morning, she discovered that Du Lin did have some special talents that could not be reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nomi菈’s cast name after Du Lin’s work, the woman’s work enthusiasm was almost completely released, and Du Lin made a greeting, on an informal occasion. Laughing and praising some of the work of Nomi, I hope that everyone will support Nomi's work. With such a less formal statement, almost all companies have actively cooperated with Nomi's statistical investigation work, which makes the little girl understand what is called real power, what is called real power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person, in one sentence, changed the attitude of all big companies, he didn’t even target anyone, he could make these companies become like this, which also made small The seeds buried in the heart of the girl because of Nomi, watered enough rain and dew under the influence of this time, let the ambition and the seeds of the desire for power break ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was nothing big happening in the West, but Du Lin went to Nano Lindes because his unreliable second brother, Mr. Merlin, finally Want to get married. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin and Su Rui two-pointed, and finally married, even if he did not say, Du Lin can also feel that the reason why Merlin is willing to marry, the key is not Su How is Rui, but this child. Mr. Kesma’s dominance of the children is unquestionable. When he snorted, even Mason, who is already the head of the police station, would shake. Once the little old man started the fire, no matter who you are, picking up the stick and smashing it, the children of the Sigma family can survive. It is a great miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their wedding was supposed to be held in February, but unfortunately Du Lin was not in the empire, Merlin only asked for a wedding extension, and Su Rui’s family did not object. Just dragged on. Now that Du Lin is back, naturally he can't drag on. After all, the children have it, and it doesn't look good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 27th, Doolin arrived in Otis first, the first time he returned two years after he left the area. When the news that he is coming back has not fully spread, tourists from all over the world have seen a scene that is surprising. The cars in the whole city are almost concentrated in the station, and some are rarely seen on weekdays. The big guys who came to the station were outside the station, which made some tourists gather here. I wanted to see if there were any big people to visit, and I was curious about this big man who could alarm the whole city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 9:15 in the morning, the whistle rang through the station. Du Lin stepped out of the train and looked at the empty platform. He smiled and made a noise, and walked toward the exit with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to welcome the arrival of Doolin, the whole seven trains were stopped from last night, just waiting for Du Lin to enter the city of Otis first. Sometimes some people are not willing to actively interfere with the operation of the world, but when they have a word, or a line, they have actually interfered with the operation of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these idiots are still so ignorant, Du Lin’s mood is still pleasant, and this is the wonderful experience brought by power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the station came out, someone greeted them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at him, this man was in his forties, dressed in very decent clothes, there was a follower around him, this person stood on the stairs Next, Du Lin gave a slight nod to the steps, but this action seems to others to be a form of surrender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Doolin, welcome home!" He opened his mouth with a very magnetic voice. He introduced himself. "I am currently in the city of Otis." Mayor, Webster, you can call me Weber."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Webster is currently the mayor of Otis and a member of the New Party, in Donald After being dismissed from office, the New Party Committee arranged Webster to replace the new mayor. Webster is a new member of the "civilian faction". He is a social middle class and has an excellent resume. He is considered to be a middle-class elite with a potential in the Bowworth group. After he took office, he was very clever and did not make any abrupt moves. Donald's "stupidity" made him learn a lot of lessons. In the city of Otis, he wants to settle the ruling period safely, first of all to recognize and respect the law of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, he did very well. Instead of rashly changing or destroying the rules left by Du Lin, he actively maintained such rules and allowed the major forces in the city of Otis to accept the new mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, when he heard that Du Lin was coming to Otis, his first thought was to hide, but then he thought about it, it was not a correct decision. Finally, I have to come to see Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As just shown, this is definitely not a pleasant experience, but it is a must. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
