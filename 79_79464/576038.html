			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreil wants to personally retaliate against these gangsters who almost destroyed his beauty. For this requirement, Devier did not care. . In the heart of Mrs. Vivienne, Delier should be like this, can not tell what is a big thing, what is a small thing, and always learn the tolerance that the upper class has. Therefore, she agreed without hesitation, this is really only a small matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my famous post, take it to the regional police station to find the director of Prando, then tell your request, he will let you export Mrs. Vivian took out a hot stamp from Xiaokun Bao, and took off the pen used as an ornament in De Lier’s chest pocket, and wrote his name on the famous post. And the date. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper-class men like to use business cards, they made a variety of business cards to show their personality, some are magnificent, some are low-key, some people I once had a book called "Looking at Characters through Business Cards", which is said to have been hot for two years. And women, there are not so many official and business affairs, so they like to use famous posts. The difference between a famous post and a business card has a huge difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business cards have their own rules, size, thickness, and even the use of colors and some decorations are exquisite. But the famous posts are not so much attention, except for a few places that must be noted, others are determined by the mood. For example, Mrs. Vivian's famous post is about eight centimeters wide and twelve centimeters long, using a softer but tougher paper. Around the famous post, a circle of green vines is stamped with gold foil, representing her family. In the words of the New Party, there are only rotten aristocratic members - at least one of the family and above is eligible to bronze around the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of these golden vines has a flower, which is the emblem of the Vivian family. Inside the gilded vine, it is a verdant field and a blue sky that occupies more planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her name is signed on the blue sky, and the date is signed, the date is critical. Before the New Party had not overthrown the rotten feudal rule, the nobility's business cards or famous posts had a strong lethality and deterrence. There used to be a farmer who had never been to school for a day. He didn’t know where to get a business card of an empire’s big man, went to a remote area to swindle and swindle, and finally disappeared with a value of tens of thousands of gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, the nobility has begun to sign the date. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new party overthrowing the decaying feudal system and establishing a new order, the date of signing or not signing is not of much significance. Because the liaison and docking of the official business have more strict official documents as a link, the business cards of the nobles have lost their previous effectiveness. However, there are still many aristocrats who like to sign dates on famous posts or business cards. In their words, this is nostalgia and a symbol of maintaining their aristocratic identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor symbol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreil did not take long after leaving the post, "Jon" appeared in the eyes of Mrs. Vivian, her mouth with a smile Going over to Jon, "Awaited for a long time?", she reached out and gently helped Jon to smooth a small wrinkle on the side collar, then kissed Jon's arm with her relatives. Walking inside the art gallery, "Sorry, I suddenly called you, I really don't know what to do..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two gradually disappear In the depths of the art gallery, after a heavy bronze door was closed, no sound could be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, Delil found Prando with a famous post, and Prando took the celebrity and looked through it several times before he was reluctant. The confirmation of this is indeed the famous post of Mrs. Vivian. He has his own way to distinguish between these things, and this is what he must have as a regional police chief. He put the nameplate in the drawer, then put his hands on the table and looked up at Delier. "So...what do you want from me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ; & nbsp; & nbsp; Delisle touched his cheek, felt the sting his eyes slightly jump so that he came, and now he can not forget those three guys suddenly sprang to his fiercely beating It also took away the "benefit fee" that he received from Doolin. The physical pain and economic loss filled his heart with hatred. He actually showed a smile. "I want to see the three guys unlucky. Do you understand?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which three?", Prando's tone was a little impatient. Mrs. Vivian is indeed a big man, much more powerful than him, and he knows very well. But this does not mean that any guy holding Mrs. Vivian's famous post can confess to him, he is the director of the regional police station! But at the moment when his brow wrinkled, his heart twitched, and a drop of cold sweat slowly slipped down his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything happens so fast, like a drop of sweat is already ready, just waiting for this signal in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Delier's next words confirmed his conjecture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the guy with three sly faces on his face, and his two accomplices!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Oops! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first reaction of Prando. In order to avoid adding more trouble to him, he hinted that Codor would just look for three people to sin. . At that time, he closed his eyes with one eye, and when he lifted his hand, wouldn’t he mix it? And Mrs. Vivienne gave him a very portrait... with a modern art atmosphere, and Mrs. Vivienne may not personally stare at it, and Prando felt that it would be better to paste it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He guessed nothing wrong, Mrs. Vivienne had forgotten about it the next day, this little thing she didn’t have to keep in mind all the time. In my heart, even if she didn't see the bruise on Delier's face, she couldn't even think of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this is not from Mrs. Vivian, but on Delil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando’s eyes stared at De Lier with a fierce look, and Delier, who was always clenched with the little finger, had a sharp eye in Prando’s fierce In view of it, some could not help but look away. "You mean Cod..." Delier nodded. Prando continued: "I am sorry, you are late, they have been detained. In the Tiel City District Prison, even without the consent of the Warden, I could not see the three people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delier For a moment, he really didn't know about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police system and the prison system seem to be a family, but it is not. Both sides are independent of each other. As Prando said, the warden disagrees. No one can see a prisoner in prison. Even if he wants to remove his position, he has to wait for approval. Maybe some prisoners will suddenly become violent in this process. The prison system does not have much power in the system of the whole society, but once it is involved with this system, it can appreciate the power of the "independent king." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In prisons, prisoners often call the warden "King of the King" because all the rules and regulations in the prison are decided by the governor. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
