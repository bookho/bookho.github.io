			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is outside?", Mrs. Bain rolled up her apron and rubbed the water on her hand, and some curiously walked toward the door of the house. The Bain family is also considered a high-class family in Orodo, better than the middle class, but worse than the real high society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bain worked in the State Medical Education Management Office before transferring to the newly established Transportation Bureau and serving as the Deputy Director. Some people say that Mr. Bain has offended the governor or other important big man, so he was taken to the newly established department of the Transportation Bureau. It seems that it has been promoted from a staff member in the office to a deputy director, but everyone knows that the Medical Education Management Office manages the medical and educational institutions throughout the state, and the power in these two areas is staggering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it’s just a staff member, there’s a lot of power in this area, at least the owners of those organizations want to do something that they haven’t done before. It is necessary to pass Mr. Bain’s hurdle. As a persistent and principled staff member, Mr. Bain did not perform as sacred as a priest, but at least did not pass some projects that should not be passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a change of work, Mrs. Bain did not say anything, and there are still some complaints in her heart. In the past, as long as the holidays were over, there were always people who would bring gifts to the door. They don’t accept valuable things, but those cheap little gifts, Mr. Bain, never refuse. Now that I have just changed my job, those who used to come to the door in the past immediately disappeared. The cold atmosphere on the weekend made Mrs. Bain somewhat uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She listened to the doorbell, thinking that the person who should be the gift came, and a smile on her face, slightly rubbing the hair on the side, this Only opened the door. What surprised her was that there were people outside the door, but not the gift-giving, her daughter. The false smile on her face melted for a moment, and there was a real laugh. She immediately took Alisa's hand and greeted her. By the way, she took heavy luggage from her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am still telling your father in the morning, if you don't come back, we plan to go to Tener to see you next weekend.", Mrs. Bell puts The baggage was placed on the side of the shoe rack in the door. After the daughter went to a pair of slippers, she smiled and looked at her daughter. She nodded. "Good, thinner but more spiritual, good-looking, the whole person looks mature. A lot. I don't quite agree that you go to work in the field alone, but it seems that this is really helpful for your growth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa smiled reluctantly and took Mrs. Bain's hand into the living room. The quiet and empty living room made Alisa have a bit of doubt. I have to know that when she came back from the weekend, her family was full of people, but how many people today? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bain put down the newspaper in his hand, took off his black-edged eyes, and placed it on the table with the newspaper. After taking a look at Alisa, he nodded slightly and patted the sofa around him. "Your mother asked you how you came back at this time? Looks like you are tired, have you eaten at night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa has a younger brother who is currently attending college and reading the university she once yearned for. I rarely come back on weekdays. Maybe my children are not around. This time, Alisa didn't feel the suffocation that made her unbearable. She sat quietly on the sofa, and her loved ones were around, suddenly there was an urge to cry. That sentence filled with caring greetings tore the shell that she had hardly cast on her way back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears are like broken balls, falling one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Bain just wanted to ask what she was asking, Mr. Bain stopped her with her eyes, and asked Alisa to cry for a while before he asked. : "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa squinted her hair and raised her head with a smile of tears. "I resigned and didn't want to go any more." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on Mrs. Bain’s face has become a bit stiff. As a person who she has taken for granted, she knows what the reason Alisa is doing, nothing more than nothing. Just a few. The character of Alisa can go out to work alone. If it is just a simple grievance, I am afraid that she can't let her carry her luggage and go home to cry. It must be related to men. Mrs. Bain moved to Alisa's side and clasped her hand. "Are you in love?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she asked this sentence, she was in her heart. In fact, I hope that Alisa can deny her guess, although in this world people are not particularly concerned about chastity, but a layer of film and a film is basically equal to two different marriages. No one likes to use second-hand goods. Even in this more open society, there is no film in the upper class to represent the future status of women in the family, so Mrs. Bain wants her daughter to give herself a negation. The answer, but unfortunately, Alisa's silence defaulted to her words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Bain’s hair seemed to stand up, and Mr. Bain stopped her again and asked, “Do you like that man?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Lisa nodded a bit, but she felt that it was just not love, just a kind... not reconciled? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her confused eyes, Mr. Bain breathed a sigh of relief, he was not very worried about whether his daughter had lost or not, and always wanted to climb with the big guys. His wife, he feels that as long as he can pass, it may not be a good thing. The giants have the troubles of the giants. With Alisa's character, she may not be able to tolerate her husband's heart, but the flower is almost a problem that all upper-class men have to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inclination of social resource inequality makes these men face more temptations, from the same class, from the temptation of the middle and lower classes. These women may not want to replace the position of the main room into the giants, but their existence can always be disgusting, at least Mr. Bain can not understand. Many of those decent people have done things to flirt with other women in front of their wives, and Alisa can’t stand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, let her marry an ordinary middle class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't like that man, why should you cry for him? Whether you left him or he left you, for you, this is not The best result? If you like him and still love him, go find him and make it clear. If you don't like him or love him, let go of yourself." Mr. Bain took out his pocket watch I glanced at it. "Put it up and take a shower. Then I will open the meal." He patted Alisa's back and said with a smile: "Welcome home, child!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Mr. Bain said, Alisa felt a lot better. After thanking Mr. Bain, she apologized to Mrs. Bain and ran to the suitcase and rushed to the building. On your own room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing the closing voice, Mrs. Bain complained. "You shouldn’t say that, I was going to introduce Alisa to Little Dunn. He said last time that he really wanted to see Alisa, but now I don't know if I should do that!", Little Dunn is the eldest son of Dunn Rhodes, who owns two malls in Orodo. And a racetrack being built, worthy, is a local celebrity in Oro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
