			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if I kill me, I won’t take the boat again, I swear!" Luke snorted and he could vomit something in his stomach. When it was on the boat, it spit out, and then spit is just some water. Two guys, one left and one right, supported him, attracting a lot of people’s attention. He didn't let the people around him let go of him because he knew his legs were long over obedient. This damn ship, the whole world is shaking when it is on the boat, but the sky is not shaking. It’s hard to land now, I didn’t expect the world to shake, and it’s the turn of the sky to start shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sky was shaking again, a disgusting feeling came to my mind again. He retched for a while and spit a slobber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he came to Irian City and he took the best of the 20 protection teams. These people have human lives on their hands. In order to be able to turn the wealth under the ground into cash as quickly as possible, he bought a lot of cheap labor from organizations that specialize in human trafficking. These workers are very harmless when they are in a human trafficking organization. They are as gentle as a castrated stallion, and when they reach his hand they become like a wild horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first bought 500 people, I ran away more than 100 in just three days and lost a few moments. Ten thousand. He tried to give those workers better food, a better living environment and even pay them. But the escape still exists until he understands that goodness can't solve the problem, and the escape finally ends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the valley, the bodies that are hanged on the trees are like the insects that are ready to become butterflies in the autumn bushes, layer by layer, hundreds of The body was hung on the tree and swayed gently with the wind. Those people do a great job, at least to shock these workers to make them honest and docile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From only a few hundred workers to tens of thousands of people now, there are only more than 500 people in the mine protection team. These mine protection teams are like Luke. The private armed forces, when necessary, they can be used as military forces to suppress the riots of those workers, which is the most powerful force in the mining area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He built his mine into a small kingdom of his own, he is the supreme king, and he is well aware that this is only a small place. If you want to get more wealth, the higher status will not be found in the mining area. You must be on the most shining stage of the empire to get out of this small place. So he won Corinna and intends to socialize as the first non-ferrous film investor and producer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also thought about using money to open the way, get rid of the hat of the upstart, and become a real person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the problem is that the plan was terminated unexpectedly. The main crew of the entire crew was trampled for hospitalization in a car accident. What made him angry was that the car accident was not natural. It happened, but someone made it deliberately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty thousand hits, he doesn’t feel bad, he is distressed that his plan has not been implemented and he was destroyed, so this time he took two The ten best team members of the mine protection team came here. He came to trouble. He wanted to ask the guy, what kind of hatred he had with himself, and he had to stop himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he didn’t think that he had not been killed by the enemy, he was first killed by the sea boat. He swears that he will not take a boat again in this life, neither in the river nor the sea, will not sit again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boss, where are we going now?", Luke’s dogleg, Brandon, stood by Luke’s side and had a cheesy in the mining area Brandon. But the nickname that is absolutely fearful to the bottom of my heart is called the "butcher." From the first worker he helped Luke kill, the number of workers killed by him was at least thirty or fifty. Even the practice of hanging a person on a tree was first proposed by him. In his words, only when people die under the eyes of those people will they know what it is called fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke shakes his legs, the sky spins a little slower, he tries to take a few steps, and finally gives up his idea of ​​walking independently," Of course, go to the hospital and find out what is going on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brandon called and called a few cars, although Luke was Irian didn't invest in any projects, but he also knows some local rich people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question has been asked, why rich people are always incompatible with the general public, they do not participate in gatherings, do not participate in social activities, do not know what to do all day. In fact, this is just a wrong view, because the person who raised the question does not have the status and power to have an equal dialogue with the rich. The social circle and the top social circle are not integrated, so they don’t know that the rich are not The general public is out of place, but not incompatible with the poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich have their own social circle, and the same people hold the party, not that they are very lonely, but the people who ask questions are too low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the richest people in Irian have invested in other places, some rich people even migrated from the field to the local area, and it is not a strange thing for someone to know Luke in a complex social network. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a few cars, Luke soon arrived at the hospital and saw Corinna. The poor woman was lying in bed, and the doctor told her that it would take at least half a year to recover. At this time, her hatred of her face broke out completely when she saw Luke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s the female watch, we all blame the female watch, she made me like this!", Corinna hysterically shouted, She also wants to wave her arms, which may have involved injuries, and her face has a painful expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke glanced at the woman a little impatiently, and he rarely had a good face for women, especially the woman who paid for it. He wouldn't care. "Don't say so much nonsense, just give me a name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excavating from Corinna's teeth Two names - Freina and Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blan registered these two names and Luke turned and left. Corinna shouted and shouted, "What about my movie?" You are back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke's footsteps, looking back and looking at Corinna, there is a kind of indifference on the face that can't be clearly stated, "Movie? That's not my business. Remember, from now on you owe me 500,000. I will give you one year. No matter what method you use to make up the money, even if you don't have a penny a year later, you know the consequences! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Corinna has become such a Luke directly gave up this woman, and with this woman going out not only will not face, but will lose their own people." . He didn't know that this woman was actually like this... with a neurotic temperament, still thinking about movies? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the hospital, Luke first visited his old friend, Mr. Fowlers. I just didn't expect that Fowlers might not be at home, and then I learned that Fowlers had died in the house of the next visitor. He also stunned for this. Next, he talked about the topic, about Freina and Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena himself knows a few things, so the main object is still in Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean Mr. 350,000?" Luke's friend was a little surprised. "I heard that the person is very lonely. I have seen two sides, but there is no communication. His name is not too small. I will be here." I bought a 350,000 manor, and I have recently made a lot of moves, not only to blend into the business of the George family, but also to invest heavily in the 8th district!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; When he heard a friend introduce Du Lin, Luke had a bad appetite. He thought that Du Lin was just a small person. After all, he didn’t even hear the name. He didn’t expect to be so powerful. Just let him have a bit of pain. As a wealthy Luke, it is clear that the word "rich" is composed of "rich" and "powerful", and the word "rich" is used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is rich, especially here is not his small kingdom, he has no connections in Irian, and people in the city hall Not familiar with it, it is a bit tricky to solve this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any way to meet him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His friend thought about it Said: "On the 1st of next month, that is, after five days, there will be a food festival here. He will definitely attend, and Freena will also attend. I can recommend it for you, how, what business do you have with him? "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and smirked. "It’s a bit of business." There is still a half sentence that he didn't say, that guy 砸His plan is not only exchanges, but also conflicts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke temporarily lives in a friend’s villa, waiting for the food festival, he wants to contact Du Lin first. If the other person is good at talking, he doesn't mind becoming a friend with Du Lin. But if Doolin is not a good talker, he doesn't mind detonating a big news locally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Luke began to enjoy the leisurely life of Irian, the other side of Juan was madly pumping money to build a theater everywhere, and also crazy. Some cinemas have initiated acquisitions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His friends in the Imperial Capital told him that the George family recently discussed a rough conclusion and could discuss cooperation with Doolin and him if necessary. . With such a message, Juan has drawn almost all of the liquidity to do this, and even the money for the investment projects in the eighth district has been transferred. He prepared nearly six million for this operation, and he plans to expand the number of more than one hundred theaters originally planned by Doolin to two hundred! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
