			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, I am sorry to tell you that you have been sued!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Adams took a court summons to Du Lin at 8:30 in the morning, Du Lin looked blank. He recalled what he had done during this time and did not seem to have collided with anyone to the extent that he needed to resolve it in court. When he inexplicably took the ticket in his hand, he reacted to what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was slammed by the "Imperial Night" magazine on the grounds that Du Lin attempted to use the method of intimidation to interfere with the freedom of the press and the reason for the high lawsuit. "Imperial Color" magazine believes that in order to achieve some purpose, Du Lin has adopted intimidation, threats and other means to make some news unpublished, seriously jeopardizing the physical and mental health of journalists under the "Imperial Color" magazine, and demanding Du Lin publicly apologized in "The Color of the Empire" and compensated the intimidated journalists for various expenses of 1,700. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin threw the summons on the table and looked up at Adams standing in front of him. "Can we win this lawsuit?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, sir, no doubt we can win, like this case...", he smiled a little, "Please forgive me, they simply want to Sue you to achieve the role of propaganda. It is well known that you have always been a very famous and prestigious person in public opinion, which will naturally lead some people to find ways to gain more prestige without harming their own interests. Prosecution is obviously the easiest way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be more reporters to report you, and naturally will report "Imperial Color" magazine , thus achieving a large-scale propaganda role. When people began to wonder what kind of news company this magazine is, their sales will be significantly improved!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If they win, their influence will be fast The expansion. If they lose, there will be no loss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded, it was a bit disgusting in the early morning. Not used to it, he originally planned to return to the west tomorrow, and did not discuss matters related to insurance business with Magus. Waiting for the West to get it down, he will discuss this issue with Magus in turn. It was indeed an annoying thing that all the good moods were destroyed. He asked casually, "Do I need to appear in person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If you can sign a full power of attorney to me, you don’t need to go to court.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually a very ordinary small case, even in court The judges are very clear, and this is not the first time that "Imperial Night" has done this. Their use of sneak shots of celebrities and celebrities has angered many celebrities. The first thing they do in the face of celebrities is not to think about how to resolve disputes, but to find out from each other’s remarks. Aggressive vocabulary, then file a lawsuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This anti-bite approach quickly made "Imperial Night" rise rapidly in the middle and east of the empire, with millions of sales in each period. From these two regions. It is worth mentioning that it is only Irian, which has a sales volume of more than 400,000 copies in each period, which may be clearly related to the eighth district that has already been put into use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the completion of the eighth district, it became a sacred place for filmmakers at home and abroad. The perfect artificial scenery is enough for the film crew to stay in the eighth district without leaving the house. Ability to capture at least a dozen different environments. A large number of filmmakers gathered here, including many stars, who bought real estate and even other industries in Irian, making Irian more heated. Even the manor on the cliffs of Doolin’s cliffs has been fancy more than once, and wants to make a purchase, even if the premium is 20%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Doolin’s irritability, Adams continued, “Mr. Doolin, we can effectively defend the offense from Empire Night, then we Do you need to fight back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposal made Doolin a little interested. He nodded. "It should be a lesson!" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Adams left, Du Lin asked someone to find out why this happened. Then he learned that Xiu En had found the reporter. He first asked the other party not to continue. Shoot Freena, but this is obviously meaningless. Those reporters earned wealth and fame by selling ethical sneak shots. How could they give up their way of living and working because of a tramp? In such a situation, Xiuen can only use some slightly violent means. He first smashed the bastard and then found his home behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a happy family, in addition to the client and his wife, there are two children and an old man, the family is because of his excellent shooting skills and Selling the privacy of others has earned the power to live in a high-end community and enjoy everything the middle class can enjoy. The photos taken by this reporter, as long as they are used, will receive no less than 20 buyout fees for each one. This money is enough for him and his family to live happily and happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, Xiu En found a wild cat, blurred the flesh and blood after the wild cat fell to death, and found a shoe box with some smell from the garbage bin, and put the dead cat into it. I don't know if it is to reflect a more visually striking picture. He also tore a down pillow, filled with white feathers, surrounded the dead cats with blood and blood, and then placed a card on it. - "When you hurt someone, one day you will be hurt by others"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect is very good, because the recipient is his wife, when he When the wife opened the box in front of the children, the whole person was not good. The children were even scared and couldn't speak, curled up under the table and cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reporter who knew what happened was immediately understood. This is Du Lin’s warning to him. Because he had never encountered such a thing before he received the task of stealing Freena, which was almost a bright and straightforward one. "Imperial Night" magazine has a good cooperation law firm, most of the things can be entrusted to the law firm to solve, but this time is not the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is obviously not the "regular" way to go, it is the wild path, and when I think of many rumors about Doolin, the reporter reported the matter to the company. The company made a decisive decision to make him unprepared, that is, suing Du Lin to intimidate the reporter who threatened the "Imperial Night" magazine, and asked him to publicly apologize and compensate for all kinds of losses of 1,700. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are some things that Doolin doesn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We shouldn’t do this, it will anger Du Lin’s terrorist tycoon!", one of the magazine’s shareholders is very dissatisfied with the magazine’s current practice, and A decision made without his knowledge. This made him very angry. Once Du Lin decided to do something, they would have a big problem. "Don't you forget how the George family collapsed? Do you want to repeat these disasters on our body once? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who do newspapers or magazines almost know who made the incomparable George family a past tense, and the three feature agencies were burned out. The accumulation of decades has become a ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Doolin really wants to do something, he doesn’t need to fight and kill, just let the magazine be enough for some accidental fires. Definitely the most stupid decision. Even if it is against Magus, it is better than facing Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
