			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin walked into the toilet to open the faucet and smoked another cigarette. He glanced at the time on the watch and pushed the window open to let the wind out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind of the night God has become a lot cooler, and it has blown away some of his wine. He likes Natiya very much, but it is not the kind of favorite that he can't wait to give his genetic material to Natiya and use natural chemistry to spawn new gene collections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This negotiation will not end in Tolin’s plan tonight, and it will last for a few days. He also hopes to get in touch with Southcomers. Stinging the nerves of the imperial central bank, I just didn't expect to have a very good person here this evening, that is, Natiya sitting next to him. On several occasions, he said something very confusing, and made the atmosphere as serious as the bluestone floor of the Imperial City with a sense of historical weight, but it was easily solved by the woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not the best negotiator, but she is the best public relations expert. She makes Du Lin feel that everything is natural and does not make the process stiff. Only occasional little tricks can be resolved in time. This is a very capable woman, and he is the most needed woman at this stage, because he will soon go to the Federation, there is a lot of things that need him to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the empire side, his fame, his wealth, his power, including his inconsistency, can make him solve many things invisibly. People respect him or fear him, or both. He holds very high-end resources, whether it is his own business plan or a personal friendship that has always been in contact with Magus. These things are enough for him to face any competitors calmly and crush them. s plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not in the Federation, he does not know the joint speaker of the Supreme Council. His fame in the Federation is not enough to alarm the national level. He has no more people. If he can't refuse the advantage, then he must convince many people. At this time, it wasn’t for him to go to the messenger to make the negotiations deadlocked and then dissipated. It was someone who couldn’t let him down, let him swear and make him lose face. So he needs to have such a person who can help him open the situation during the federal period and let those people understand that he is going to the Union with friendship and peace and a lot of wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kaile can do this. He has many friends at the top of the two countries. Every aspect of society is willing to give him face, but Mr. Kaile It is impossible to stay with Du Lin all the time, then Natiya is the best choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a misunderstanding, let Anglio think that he just wants to vent the most primitive impulses of human beings, and he also believes that Natiya is unwilling because he noticed that Natiya had a hand on his hand. Wedding ring. The purpose of not taking the wedding ring in this kind of publicity is to let others know that she is a married woman, and don't have too much reverie and impulsiveness towards her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as she doesn't want to, it's a good thing because he believes that Angelo and these people will force her. One night was enough for Du Lin to perceive the strength and hegemony of Angelo, the kind of things in the bones that could not be hidden. It is like a very good family who wants others to know how great the whole family is all the time. Angelo is also revealing the unquestionable authority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he forced Natiya, the next thing would be better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door of the opposite toilet was opened for the second time, Du Lin annihilated the cigarette but went to the sink and took a cold water to rub the face. Looking at the handsome smile in the mirror, I have a taste of it. In this game, he won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin’s first chest came out of the bathroom, Natiya walked in front of him and heard Du Lin’s footsteps after Natiya’s The pace stopped and when Doolin overtook her, she followed Doolin's steps back to her seat and pushed the chair for Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin picked up the fork and took a piece of food. He took a few bites and swallowed it. "Sorry, I have been vegetarian for a while, greasy for me." The stomach is not very comfortable." He explained why he had been there for a long time, and then said, "I didn't finish my words just now. I really appreciate Ms. Natiya, so my extra condition is to buy Na. Ms. Tiaya’s contract, let her work for me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His additions make the whole table people realize what is fucking, what is called a dog Hey, what is the bitch of a bitch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you not speak? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can’t I finish the conversation once and for all, I have to say that half of the stay is still running, leaving the wrong direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anglio’s eyelids were smashed twice. He laughed twice and looked at Doolin’s eyes deep in hiding. He realized that he It’s obvious that it’s being played. Du Lin released a wrong signal, which made him mistakenly think that Du Lin just wanted to exchange body fluids with Natiya, and then he said that it was too much to force Natiya to agree with the wrong signal. The first thing after Du Lin came back was to correct this mistake he deliberately left. The current situation is very embarrassing, not between him and Du Lin, between him and Natiya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there was no conversation when Du Lin was absent, Angelo could justifiably reject Doolin, but now he has hurt Natiya and threatened her with a threatening tone to do what she does not want to do. Even with her family, even if he can still refuse to do so, will Natiya refuse? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, you need to do something before it happens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Du Lin, Ms. Natiya is the most important partner of our South Business Bank and an indispensable partner for us. We will not use her future. As a bargaining chip between us, you can change a proposal.", this sentence of Angelo is clearly said to Doolin, but then look at Natiya, because then can lead the results of this additional request, Not his Angelo, nor Du Lin, is Natiya himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as she said she didn’t want to, Du Lin’s little trick of the next day went bankrupt... Is this another trap? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anglio has turned himself around again, his mood is very complicated now, because this additional requirement is a prerequisite for Dulin’s agreement, if What if I have to do this? Will he raise higher demands through his own negation? This is very likely. Rejection in commercial negotiations does not necessarily mean that you need to reduce your own needs. Sometimes you can use your refusal to expand your expectations of your interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has always maintained his own demeanor. He looks at Natiya. "This question may ask Ms. Natiya himself..., of course, Ms. Gentlemen, please let me have a chance to convince Ms. Natiya before Ms. Natiya gives a reply.", Angelo can only nod, he can't refuse, it doesn't suit his style. Personality and certainty about the direction of this negotiation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natiya looked at Du Lin’s brain when she was in a mess, and her thinking ability became very poor. She didn’t know if she should be happy at this time. It’s sad, in short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took the initiative to pick up the bottle for the first time and poured a glass of wine for Natiya. He also poured a glass. He picked up the glass and said, "Nati Ya, you are a very charming woman. I saw a woman like you for the first time. I honestly said it was very amazing. This is not a compliment. Of course, I ask you to believe me too. I don’t have any intention to marry you. I respect your personality and respect your attitude towards the family...", he looked at the wedding ring on Natiya, and Natiya looked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was this eye that suddenly felt a warmth in her heart, especially when she was hurt, Du Lin actually noticed this detail and showed respect for her independent will. Comparing the words and attitudes of Angelo, she didn't know why she wanted to cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that if we can work together, then we can definitely have a good chemical reaction, the best one. I can't wait to want Try it, maybe it’s a different opportunity for you and me.” He said that he and Natiya touched the wine glass and then looked at Angelo, “Mr. Angelo, for this. I am willing to continue to reduce my demand, 100 million in cash, 25 percent of the patent rights, and buy out the contract of Ms. Natiya in the South Commercial Bank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp A director sitting on the side also drank a lot of wine at night, and he smiled blushingly. "Mr. Du Lin, you are the best young person I have ever seen, with a price of 28 million. For another chance, I can see that you really like Natiya."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anglio is thinking, suddenly awakened by this sentence, he is slightly embarrassed Looking at the guy with his eyes, the anger in his eyes almost spurted out, which made the director wake up instantly, he realized that he said Any more ...... Well, actually he does not feel wrong, he just wanted to play rounders, and I think this is actually nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Du Lin will not let go of this great opportunity. He looks at Natiya again, "28 million?", Natiyah Looking over the other places, Du Lin laughed softly. He took another sip of wine and shook his head and said, "No, even more money, 30 million, 40 million, it is worth it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anglio looked at Du Lin stunnedly, and looked at the other side, looking at other places, obviously in the tears of Natiya, a little do not understand Why is Natiya worth so much? With this money, I would like to find the young and beautiful senior technicians who can enjoy the day of entering the grave. He didn't understand, but he also understood the current situation. He sighed. "Natiya, what is your opinion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natiya, who had dried her eyes and tears, turned back and smiled. "Why not?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin would not give anyone any chance, Stand up and pick up the wine glass. "Then our agreement is reached. I will sign the contract tomorrow morning at my estate, before eleven o'clock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
