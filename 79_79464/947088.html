			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the laws of the Empire, incumbent officials are not allowed to be investigated, monitored, or interrogated without the consent of the Supreme Court of the Empire. This incumbent means that there are formal administrative duties, and those positions within the party are not counted. There are many reasons for the passage of this clause. The conflict between the old and new parties was fierce in the early days, and there were countless incidents such as obituaries, which led to the almost complete paralysis of the work of the city hall in many places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this legal provision was passed, and at least one official could not be harassed during his tenure. If the official is really in trouble, the Supreme Court of the Empire will issue a document to temporarily dismiss the official and let him cooperate with the investigation. Only so far, the Supreme Court has not passed any resolution to allow the authorities to investigate the incumbent officials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Anti-Organizational Crime Investigation Bureau from the beginning of its birth, the main target is Du Lin, and even once was the chief task of the Anti-Organization Crime Investigation Bureau as the number one task to grasp . Unfortunately, he suddenly became the mayor, passively exploiting the loopholes of the imperial law and avoiding the situation being investigated. This made the General Director greatly annoyed. What is even more annoying is that the criminal organization headed by Du Lin is well-structured and well-defined. Other than Du Lin, the core figure, others can be replaced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, even if you grab a branch of the fellowship, it’s just a change for Du Lin, it’s impossible to hurt. Dynamic bones. The structure of the civil society organization is very representative. In the way of nationality and religion, a large number of young people who are brainwashed and blindly acquainted are joined. Their passionate beliefs and allegiance are only one person, that is Du forest. Strictly speaking, their leader is only the president of the general Du Lin, the president is just a part of the power to replace Du Lin, and manage the daily work of the club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These club presidents don’t have any value. Even if all the club presidents are caught, a new batch of club presidents will appear soon. In other words, if Du Lin can't be sent to prison, the organization of the fellowship can't be completely smoothed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for a long time, the policy of the General Directorate of Anti-Organization Crime was to monitor the passive collection of evidence by each club. They have not yet obtained the resolution of the Supreme Court. Naturally, There is no power to monitor Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this is to hope that another way to drill the loopholes in the law, let the president’s criminal behavior involve Du Lin, and then persuade the club president to give out Doolin was involved in the process and evidence of the crime. With these things in place, they can directly file a complaint against Du Lin over the legal provisions of the legal provisions regarding the investigation and monitoring of the incumbent officials' legal provisions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Bangka contacted Doolin, the entire Woodland Anti-Organization Crime Investigation Agency was very excited. This is definitely a perfect opportunity. As long as Du Lin can be dismissed, it will be enough to show the ability and authority of the Anti-Organization Crime Investigation Bureau to all sectors of society, effectively deter and control other small-scale criminal organizations, and avoid or even eliminate a wide range of organized crimes. The situation arises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news was quickly transmitted to the ears of the Director General of the Imperial Capital. The Director General personally talked with the Director of the Anti-Organization Crime Investigation Bureau of Woodland and told him everything. To act in a low-key manner, if there is no conclusive evidence, try to avoid disturbing Du Lin as much as possible, even if it is acceptable to let Bangka pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the direction of the Director General, the Woodland Branch immediately began the related work, except that all the agents began to closely monitor the state and his men. The whereabouts of the company also added personnel to take over the work of the telegraph office. Once Bangka and his backbone enter the phone booth, it is important to record all the kiosks in the area to avoid the embarrassing situation that the delay caused by the operation causes the recording to be incomplete and cannot form valid evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Bangka is also very clear, someone is staring at him, but he does not care. It is not an easy task to catch his horse. Anyone who can have his own loud title is not so easy to find flaws. Those who are easily found by people have long disappeared into people's sights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he was sitting in a black car with a cigarette, and the road was diagonally opposite the gate of the villa area. He arranged a lot around him. Man, Dooling did not let him kill the two people at once, and he naturally would not make a wrong decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is very good to them, giving them unimaginable salary, giving their family as much help as possible, even in every city of Guar Free school, hospital and other related security facilities have been built in the neighborhood. So everyone is willing to sell for Doolin, which is also for their own lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thousands of years, a predecessor can emerge, and it is hard to wait until the legendary Messiah comes to the world again. If it is not good to defend him, is it still? Do you have to wait for hundreds of thousands of years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the driver found?", Bangka smoked a cigarette and asked a young man behind him. He was the guy who was stalking around here. I watched Ornes come down from a taxi and found him. The first thought after knowing this incident was to find the taxi. Although Du Lin did not tell him to do this, he felt that he should figure out where Ornes had gone yesterday. It would be better to know that he met. who. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young people should have a cry. It is not difficult for ordinary people to find a taxi in the city. Fortunately, Woodland has fully implemented the car license system. Each car has its own unique license. He didn't care very much at the time, but he also remembered the three numbers and quickly found the owner information of the taxi through the people at the taxi service company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonca regained his gaze from the opposite side of the road. "Very well, arrange it. Ask him where he got on the place of Ornes yesterday, Ornes." There are no other people around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man behind him immediately opened the door and drilled out, trotting into the phone booth next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a building about a hundred meters away, the windows facing the street are half-closed and half-closed, a detective with a high-powered camera constantly Press the shutter, "The young man entered the phone booth and let the telegraph office start recording."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The telegraph office got the news and immediately put six telephone booths on the street. The line is connected to the recording device and the recording starts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ask the coachman, when is the second person in the car, and if anyone sends him to the car, ask as soon as possible, I will meet in five minutes. Call you again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the phone being hanged, the recording device also slowly stopped working, and the agents began to study in stages. Information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the phone ring on the Solo desktop rang, and he looked at the phone a little strangely, when Ornes was ready to pick it up. He stopped Ornes and walked over to the phone, picking up the receiver the next time the bell rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you recently offended someone?", a familiar female voice came from the receiver, and Solo snorted. The owner of this voice is his wife. The daughter of a director of the Imperial Bank is ten years younger than him. This is a political marriage. There is no love or love at all. Apart from the physical needs, there is not much feeling between the two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party will rely on the power of the Cape family to board the position of the director, and is trying to launch a charge to the position of the chairman. The Cape family sometimes needs the imperial central bank to help them deal with some of the lesser amount of dirty money, so he and his current wife know how to get married in a few days without the help of a caring person. This marriage has brought great convenience to both parties and has been successful so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many political marriages, they have their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the phone call makes him a little confused, when his little wife started to care about herself, and there is a doubt as to why she would ask such a question. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo’s woman’s tone in the kung fu earpiece seems to be impatient, waiting for him to answer directly: “Someone inquired about your temporary inside the central bank. Signing permission, I will remind you of this, I wish you good luck, bastard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short busy tone, there is no sound in the receiver again, Soro wrinkles The brow put the earpiece back. He licked his lips tightly and lowered his head slightly. He looked at Ornes. "Have we recently offended someone? My wife told me that someone is tracking my whereabouts. This is not a good one. Message!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this is definitely not good news. Those who are not qualified to provoke the Cape family are unlikely to do this. This is the worst kind of behavior and it is very likely that a conflict will break out. Since the other party dares to trace his whereabouts, it means that this person is not afraid of the Cape family, which is of course a bad news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ornes was also stunned by Soro. He recalled what he had done during this time and he hesitated: "Will? Will it be Doolin?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo is not sure whether this person is a person at the first time. He just said it casually. Later, I think that the proposal of Ornes is very operational. Let Ornes arrange it. However, in this process they are absolutely impossible to expose themselves. They have not met with any reporter, and they have not even called. The only one who contacted both sides was the one anonymous letter, but there was no sender on the anonymous letter, no address was sent, and there was no postmark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Solo also saw the letters written by Ornes, without any deliberate traces and notes, he could not see that it was written by Ornes. Others are even less likely to see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is all that Du Lin found out that they did, then Du Lin’s ability is too big, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that Soro looks down on Doolin, he really doesn’t have this skill! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
