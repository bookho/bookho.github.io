			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler wants to see this kid called Doolin for two reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason is that his current position is very sensitive and embarrassing. In the eyes of the Ogildinians, the Guarts are "conquered races". For the Ogilde people who have a strong sense of superiority, the Guartes are "inferior people" and are not subject to the losers. Now a loser can actually become one of the 36 members of the Chamber of Commerce, so many people can't stand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not Heidele’s cautiousness, try to avoid revealing flaws as much as possible, I’m afraid he has been voted to dismiss him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he needs a force, a force that can support him until he has an opinion on him, and he has to hold his nose. He has been stunned for a long time, and that is the power of the guar who was broken up. Once the Guars are united, coupled with his guidance and command, for the stability of the empire, both the official and the Chamber of Commerce, they must take care of the "leader" of this guar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only then can he continue to grow his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is actually the continuation of the first reason. Heidler needs someone to help him, not commercial help, but to do something for him. Light thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the capitalist circle, there is a saying, "When you are kind, you have to face countless demons." The problem, but what other cores are talking about is the attitude of the capitalist and the attitude between the exploited. The former cement tycoon Duffelk was very good for the workers. In addition to giving them higher wages than other industry workers, they also gave some benefits and always mined with the workers. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, Dolcek suffered a blockade from the business, his opponents combined to form a new company, and he launched a positive Cruel business competition. The lower-priced cement produced by the other party shredded Dolce's market defense. In order to protect Davod, it was necessary to reduce the treatment and welfare of workers to face malicious prices. The pain caused by the auction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When both sides suffered heavy losses and were ready to stop, the workers of Doverk’s strike went on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is simple. They demanded a return to the previous high wages and high benefits and refused to pay for cruel business competition. In less than a month, the market share of Duvalk Cement, which once exceeded 65%, was suspended due to labor problems, and the market was embezzled. The former cement king declared bankruptcy. The huge market and legacy assets were immediately swallowed up by the crocodile in the capital market. Mr. Duvard, who had been infinite scenery, jumped down the top floor of the Empire State Building and left a dark future for his life. Blood stains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a problem that Dolcek needs to face alone, and it is almost a problem that all capitalists need to face. Under the support and manipulation of the workers' union, the workers already have the capital that opposes and fights against the capitalists. Once the workers’ union believes that a capitalist has harmed the interests of the workers’ members, it will initiate a resistance action such as a marching strike. If the situation worsens, they will also prohibit workers’ union members from working in their company’s factories, so that a company can fall into a moment. In a state where no one is available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is the workers’ union really able to talk to the capitalists on the same level? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is not because the capitalists have money, some people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to say that the people here are those who can’t see the light. It can be said to be a gang, or it can be said that there is a lack of work in the society. Idle idlers. They will use the threat and coercion of force to prevent the strikes from happening, and even use death to threaten certain responsible persons in the workers' unions, so that they have to compromise. Of course, in fact, the most common means is to spend money to buy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler has few people to use, he is being stared by the Ogildin, if he uses his own hands to do these things will inevitably be The man stared, so he desperately hoped that someone could be the sharpest knife in his hand and do things for him that he could but could not do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fellowship is a good opportunity. He has money and doesn't care about spending money. As long as he can achieve his goal, it doesn't matter if he spends more money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Heidler very much hopes to see Du Lin as soon as possible and support the development of the fellowship, and it must be as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the Association has not attracted anyone’s attention. Even if Heidler and Du Lin meet, it will not attract any storm. But if the fellowship development is good, it has attracted some attention from the forces. At that time, he will meet Du Lin again, and some people will start to guess the purpose of doubting him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the next morning, Du Lin just came out of the workshop and saw two guys in suits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone wants to see you, take a trip with us." One of them looks gentle, short-haired, with gold-rimmed eyes, elegant suit Let him have a successful person's style. He looked at Doolin's eyes with a gentle smile, but the scorn and disdain hidden in the eyes were discovered by the sensitive Du Lin. He had been a guy who had been dreaming for decades, such a person in a dream. I have seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Du Lin is wisely not showing that the clothes and accessories on the other side are already more than all his deposits. In this capital is king. Money in society is the standard for measuring whether a person is successful or not. He does not have this standard, and he has not offended such people, so he thinks he is safe. But he still called Graf together, and the two of them sat together on the new car with the roof of the car produced last year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space inside the car is not too small, the curtain car and the outside world have become two worlds, the guy who looks very gentle has been holding a smirk He snorted. "My name is Ramas. This time I followed Mr. Heidler's request and picked you up to meet him. Before I see Mr. Heideler, I need to remind you of some points." He saw A silent Dulin and an excited Glaff, shook his head inconspicuously. "When you talk, you don't get permission from Mr. Heidler. Don't look straight into his eyes. Don't yell, don't use Vulgar language, you can't bring dirty words and the black words on your street when you speak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before you talk, consider whether your words are appropriate and clear. Express your meaning in your heart, be as clear as possible, and don't add body language, try to keep your own decent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looks and before There is no difference, but the inexplicable inside is deep inside him. A flame being tossed. He looked at Mr. Ramas with the same hypocritical smile and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramas smiled with satisfaction, but he did not know that he had offended Du Lin, they had already enemed, and they were dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every word he said was a humiliation to him in Doolin’s ear, a denial of everything he had, and a malicious embarrassment to him. Rasma tramples on his self-esteem, tramples on his personality, and tramples on his dignity. His kind is high, like the look of a spicy chicken, the stinging Doolin's self-respect and personality, Du Lin vowed, if there is a chance, no! It must be, he must retaliate back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the anger and humiliation generated by the deep Du Lin’s heart, Graf’s fool is listening very seriously, and nodding his head, his face Excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous case of Graf was due to Mr. Heidler’s intervention, so that he did not wear the prisoner, he was grateful to the big man he had never seen before. I even think that this big man is the guardian of all Guartes. Otherwise, how can a big man who is so high and above help him with a small person he has never seen before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silence, the Golden Horse car slowly stopped outside a manor on the outskirts of the city of Tener, and Mr. Rasma opened the car and let the door open. They went down and pointed to the door. "There will be people who will take you to see Mr. Heidler. I have other things to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are gone After a few steps, Du Lin suddenly stopped. He looked back and saw that Mr. Ramas was wiping the position they had done with a handkerchief, and then threw the handcuff to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin turned back and took a deep breath, pressing the inexplicable anger and humiliation of his heart. He did not know that this was everything he had experienced in his dreams, and he was quietly transforming his three views and his character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?", Graf licked Du Lin with his elbow, and said with concern: "You don't look good, it was too sleepy yesterday. Is it late? God, we will see Mr. Heidler soon, you have to adjust yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin could not help but sneer: "So do you want to use your own stray as a stray dog?" He said that he should not say it when he said this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grav stunned and shook his head. "When you see Mr. Heideler, you will know who he is." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a saying that the Tao is different, and Du Lin just saw a Graf, not refuting. He took a deep breath and straightened his spine. He stood tall and walked into the manor like a victorious general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the beautiful gardening, looking at the well-dressed gardeners carefully trimmed the green leaves, his heart drifted far away local. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
