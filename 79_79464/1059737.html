			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has been thinking about a question, whether to show up with Magus - about insurance companies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insurance companies will inevitably become a company with great influence. What is more important is that Du Lin’s fancy is the actual behavior of insurance companies “kidnapping” participants. Anyone who is insured is a poor person who has been abducted by an insurance company, especially long-term insurance that is too long and costly. These people may entrust themselves to the insurance company with a low-risk way of invoking a part of the future, and let the insurance company realize the humble desire for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once an insurance company is facing huge risks and may be bankrupt or bankrupt, these people will become an unassailable force, especially A company that provides insurance services to all members of a family, even two generations and three generations. These families and members have injected too much money into the insurance company, and hope that they will not allow insurance companies to go bankrupt and collapse so easily. These people need only introduce a small amount to protect their rights. Being able to take to the streets to shout for the insurance company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running an insurance company to make money is only part of it, more importantly, the social influence brought by the insurance company, and this is still a social influence that no one can ignore. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the policy of the three guarantees was rejected in the western part of the country, the working class in the western insured would be connected in series to conduct a general strike throughout the western region, despite Dooling instigated some people in this incident, but it is undeniable that 99% of the insureds chose to strike, not all of them were inspired by Doolin. They must maintain their own power and lack effective ways. They can only achieve the possibility of upward transmission of appeals through their own actions that affect the stability of society! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, the cabinet is also a good state government, and they feel the trouble, and now they are really starting to deal with it. Now the official has not felt more trouble because the founder of the three-guarantee policy, Mennon, has returned to the embrace of God, and the proponent party of the business is also squatting for the prisoner and facing the situation of dissolution. In this state of no power, such a terrible behavioral force has already erupted. If someone leads the organization, I am afraid that the whole riot will be possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Dulin wants, the influence that the empire can't ignore from top to bottom, and the destructive power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn't know if he should say this to Magus now, which is why he has not been looking for Magus. Magus is an old fox, or a thousand-year-old fox who is getting older and can't die. It is very likely that he said these things to him. Magus immediately discovered some of the mysteries, and thus he was more determined. Let yourself do it. This is not impossible, it is like a painting in the gallery, which shows an unprecedented expression and hangs high prices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are on the sidelines, want to interpret their own sentiments from this new style of painting, then refer to the style and content to evaluate this Whether the real price of the painting is as high as its standard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if someone asks to buy this picture, some visitors who might not be interested at all will be interested in the painting, and those who are born will Visitors who are interested in it will inspire an impulse to buy the painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human beings are sensible most of the time, but when they face some competition, they become unreasonable, and the desire to win can be transformed into many performances. Form, including the bid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Maggs realizes the importance of insurance companies in stabilizing society, maybe... there will be the first officially run large company to advocate insurance companies Business. In the past, in the exchange of Magus, Magus also put forward a lot of aggressive ideas, such as the dissolution of the Chamber of Commerce will always be able to withdraw the power of the Chamber of Commerce to the hands of the Empire. For example, strengthening the management and power penetration of the Imperial Central Bank allows the empire to know all the information in the imperial central bank anytime and anywhere, and to reform the system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus is an old man who has no desire for power in life, but at work, when his identity changes from "imperial citizen" Magus When the "Prime Minister of the Cabinet" Magus, his power desires will swell and he wants to put all the good things into the official pocket of the Empire. But he is very rational. He knows that some things are not what he can do. He may need the efforts of many prime ministers and even generations, so he has been subtly laying the groundwork for the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Imperial Bank is required to cooperate with some official investigations to carry out evidence collection work. Tomorrow, the Chamber of Commerce will take out the registration information and let the Imperial Ministry of Finance count it. This kind of cooperation seems to be a bit of a compromise, and it lays the foundation for a future regain of power. When people have adapted to cooperate with the official or even work together, they will not have any excessive reaction to the change of position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
