			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A railway night inspector changed his clothes because he was bitten by a mosquito and did not notice a stone on the railway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A steam locomotive driving at night passed by, the front of the car was turned upside down and caused casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gentleman who sat on the train and rushed to the contract was crying out, but he could only wait for the rescue. When he learned that his partner had been despised because he was late, his company canceled the cooperation and his company collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man who had at least one good job had lost his job because of the company’s failure, drank a few more cups during the search for a new job, and spit it out. On a car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A car owner who just bought a new car found out that his car was spit out a large piece, and complained about the bar parking worker under anger, so this name The parking worker was fired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who got out of jail and found a job to settle down, lost his job because of someone’s fault, plus expired With various bills, he had to wait for the dagger to look for opportunities in the middle of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The railway night inspector who just got off work, carrying a cigarette, walked slowly on the street, suddenly fell into the alley by the road and threatened him. Let him hand over the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The railway night inspector who just got a monthly salary to fight his robbers in order to protect his salary, and was beaten in the fight, He did not wait for the ambulance until the next morning before the cleaner found dead in the alley... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This world is very wonderful. Everything can make a profound change every day. Maybe Mr. Kemer didn’t understand this truth before, but Now he understands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beard was slightly up and down, and he stood next to his second son, Merlin, who was one meter away. He didn’t know what to say and how to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Mason became the police station and passed back to his hometown, Merlin couldn’t sit still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is now out of the wind and water, and every month will make a sum of money back, so that they can afford to spend a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason mixed a small policeman on the side of Tener, no one paid too much attention to him, but when the news came back, the whole Zijing town was boiling. The director of the regional police station, that is a big man! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Merlin felt why he only lived at home and suffered a life he didn’t like. Why can’t he just go outside and say like his brother and brother? Maybe you can make a career? If it weren't for the woman with a pockmark on her face who vowed to marry herself, Merlin might not have this ambition. But the Mazi face girl not only came to the home of Mr. Xmas, but also brought her parents, Merlin knew that this was his last chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you not willing to be here honestly?" Mr. Kesma is smoking in the pipe, and his nose is out. Smoke, "Do you think that outside is so good? Do you think they are so easy to succeed? Maybe after a while I heard not the news of your development, but the news of where you died, it is dangerous outside! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin bit his lip and said nothing, a few brothers and sisters are hiding in the side and watching it secretly, Mr. Kemer feels the need to come up with the spirit of the parents." Come, he coughed. "I know that you don't want to marry Melissa. We can reject her. There are so many girls in the town. Is there something you like right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ; &nbsp;&nbsp; Merlin still did not speak, initially he may indeed be to avoid the Mazi face girl named Melissa wants to leave here, but as this thought grows like a wild grass, it is no longer to avoid Who wants to go out, purely wants to go out to see Look, go away and try. He doesn't say what the truth is, but he knows that if his life is only in such a narrow scope, then his life is destined to be sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Ksma’s eyes shrank slightly. He looked at Merlin, who hadn’t talked, and asked, “You must go out?” Merlin nodded. He sighed, and from the day that Du Lin left home, he knew that the day would come one after another, that jerk! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and said: "I promised, but you only have two choices, go to Mason, or go to Doolin, choose one yourself." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin’s face was embarrassed, and he hesitated. “I am going to find Du Lin!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You are the least good at our children. Communicate, the mind is also relatively straight, go to Du Lin, he will teach you how to be a person in the outside world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A bus to go tomorrow morning Turner, you first go to see your bastard brother, tell him when to come back to give me a long face, and then go to Iraq... No, it is Otis looking for Doolin, your bastard brother is now the mayor." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin raised his head fiercely, his face was unbelievable, his throat slipped twice, and he asked intermittently: "You mean... Du Lin? That guy is now the mayor? The gods... are you not wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kemer glanced at Merlin and took the pipe off On the side of the handrail, he smashed, and then his head opened his eyes and teased Mr. Xiaoxma in the baby basket, and directly regarded Merlin as air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Merlin had breakfast and said goodbye to his mother and his younger siblings, holding Mr. Kemma’s thirty dollars and leaving. This town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the bus far away, Mr. Xema shook his head, I hope this bastard does not have trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road is chosen by yourself. Since you have chosen a road, you will either die on the road or smile to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is Doolin, Mason or Merlin, it is the same for him. He did his job as a father. He also knew that he could not control the children's life. He could only do what he was supposed to do, and the rest would look at the children to toss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Mason called to tell Du Lin that the second child was about to go to him, Du Lin was amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did Merlin suddenly want to come to me, is there something happening at home?", Du Lin can only guess in this direction, brothers The age is not big, if Merlin leaves the labor force at home, there will be one less. Although he will pay Mr. Zema every month, he knows Mr. Ixma's habits, even if he has money, he will not leave the life of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Du Lin's view, it may be the life of killing life, but it is Mr. Xerma's most hopeful life. No one can insist on anything about this, whether it is Mr. Xema or Du Lin. Everyone has the right to pursue the life they want. This is the gift of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this incident, Du Lin found that Mason’s tone was a little different from the past, more confident, and the tone was slightly higher, it looked His regional police chief has brought him a lot of changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, we all came out, Merlin, he certainly can't stand it, but I heard that it seems that Melissa wants to marry him, so he ran. Come out." When Mason finished the sentence, both of the brothers laughed cheerfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the three largest brothers in the Xerma family, Merlin is the most handsome, and the body is also the most fit, which may not be good with Merlin. Words are related. When Mr. Kesma told them to do some farm work, Mason and Doolin always had various reasons not to do it, or to do less, and Merlin could only work hard and resent, and extravag them. Part of the work is done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So his body is more bodybuilding than the two, and he is more likely to be liked by the girls in the town. In addition to Merlin's very determined face, they also like his body - there is no dirty thing here, because having a good body in the country means doing more farm work, opening more farmland, and You can raise some cattle and sheep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting point of the countryman is so strange, but it is also related to the living environment in the country. If you don’t have the ability to do farm work, you will not only be laughed at, but It is also possible to face a life of hunger and embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among many girls who like Merlin, Melissa is the most prominent one. She is like the kind of country girl that all adults like. Simple, kind, passionate, and have a solid body, and a face full of pockmarks. It is said that such a girl is not only a good farmer, but also a surprise in childbirth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Merlin doesn't like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin congratulated Mason on the phone, and the latter thanked Du Lin for his praise in a faint joy. "In fact, I have nothing." Didn't do it, but maybe what I usually do is seen by the governor, so he ordered my name!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
