			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of hot weapons, not everyone has the courage to continue to rush with cold weapons, no firm belief, no body, and death Fear will be magnified infinitely. More than a dozen gangsters with strange costumes are like being pressed by the pause button. They dare not have any large-scale movements, for fear of causing misunderstandings of the other party, and thus being taken away by a bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mad dog Wissen’s footsteps also stopped, and he felt his heart was beating wildly at a speed and strength that he had never experienced before. When tens of thousands of enemies, they are not as scared as they are now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, he lied. His biggest record is to be one-on-two and then violent, but he will exaggerate his ability and results, so some people believe that this is a singer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, there was only one thought in Wison’s mind. Compared with his own “mad dog”, the three guys opposite are crazy dogs? Although it is not the center of the city, it is also next to the city center! The nature of the use of firearms here definitely exceeds the nature of the use of firearms in suburban and rural areas. They won't shoot? Certainly not, they are just bluffing, want to scare themselves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cheered on himself while trying to control his trembling legs and tightening the sphincter to prevent him from smearing his most Like the pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One drop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wissen swears that only a drop of liquid is squeezed out of control, just as he prepares to say some scenes to maintain a decent moment, his face A fierce heat, the guy in front of him slammed his head back and crashed on his back. A slamming sound fell to the ground, and the dull down sound sounded like a hand piercing his chest and pinching his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short-term chaos of the neurons caused the sphincter to lose control. He not only urinated, but also a more aggressive desire to excrete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rubbed his face, the wet, tropical faint smell, and the bright red color was particularly dazzling under the dim light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people around Du Lin alternated, and the raised arms did not move. Every shot was taken away by a gang who had not yet reacted. When they could see Weissen, Wissen could also see them. The people who stood still have fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is dignified like a concrete block, and a door on the street is slowly pushed open, and the surprise in the heart of Wissen, who can barely stand on the wall, completely explodes. , filled with his whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are saved, there are witnesses, this group of mad dogs will not kill themselves, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, he was stunned and watched the young man coming out of the door dragging the body on the road, the action was efficient and fast, only used less than two Minutes, there are no more than a dozen companions. At this time, some girls came out with buckets, washed away the blood on the ground, rushed into the sewer, and cleaned them with a brush on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisson, who couldn’t control his body, sat on the ground, and he was so scared that he didn’t notice that he was sitting in some kind of heat. Something on the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin walked in front of Wissen, he was a little embarrassed, the windbreaker had long known that he had been thrown somewhere, and the button of the shirt was also rude by him. Ripped open, the shoes are gone, bare feet. The only possible proof is complete, only his pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in front of Wissen in a condescending position, his eyes rolling down, looking at Wissen with the light of the bottom of the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any hatred between us?" Du Lin asked calmly. "So you need to use so many people... to chase I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the cymbal was particularly clear at the quiet midnight, and Wissen’s teeth slammed against each other. He shook his head and squeezed out one. More than a crying ugly smile, "No, no! You listen to me, there is no hatred between us, I just want... want...", his eyes turn quickly, like a mental illness The mental patient at the time of the outbreak, "I just admire a big man like you, want to see you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;怯懦 怯懦 透 透 一 一Craving, he felt that his explanation was no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin slightly tilted his head and pondered. He hung his hands in front of his left hand and held his right wrist slowly. He lifted his right hand and the young man around him put the pistol on his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your name?" asked Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wissen, my name is Mr. Wissen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has some face Smile, Wissen suddenly felt that the smile was so warm and glaring, would he be safe and sound? It should be, or why would he laugh at me? Is smile not a symbol of friendship? Wissen also smiled stupidly, smirking and changing from falling to kneeling to express his weakness and surrender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and said: "I remember not seeing you near me when I entered the Grand Theatre. Can you tell me how you found me?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very important question. If you can find it anywhere, anytime, this means two possibilities. The first possibility is that you become a public figure, so as long as you are exposed to the public's vision, you will be noticed and concerned. But with what he has done so far, he has not reached this height, so there is no such possibility. The second possibility is that someone is staring at themselves, but they have not found it, which is why it is even more irritating. No one likes to be watched by himself, so he wants to ask clearly how this guy found himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s memory is not bad, at this time he has completely remembered who this guy is, but he did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wissen unreservedly sold the personal information of the car wash to Doolin, who himself deeply hated this guy, if not the car wash Workers, he will not suffer the misfortune of this evening. If you can leave alive, no, it will inevitably leave alive, he will make that guy look good tomorrow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin got the answer he wanted, and the things he wanted to know had results. He smiled and nodded to Weisson who was kneeling on the floor. "I think I understand, then good night, Mr. Wissen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inexplicable question asked Wissen not to turn around, he nodded and said good night. And blessings, hope that this damn experience can end soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the light of the evening, on the street side of the road, one person squatted and stood alone. The light didn't seem to like the two men. They didn't leave any light on them. They could only see the two shadows in the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standing man raised his arm, held a gun in his hand, and pulled the trigger in the pleading of the squatting guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spring spring pushed the kinetic energy nozzle of the pistol, and the compressed hot air was sprayed from the kinetic energy chamber, pushing a sharp hollow bullet in the barrel. Rotate and spray out. The special shape of the bullet allows it to fly at a very fast speed, even at a very fast speed, in a relatively straight trajectory, until the tip of the bullet penetrates a thin layer of skin and fat, and a small layer Muscle tissue, biting on the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People say that the skull is very hard, but sometimes it doesn't make sense. A strip of cracks begins to spread outward at the point where the bullet touches the skull, and the kinetic energy of the bullet does not decrease, and it is still moving forward. Just because of the blockage of the bones, the hollow bullets have some variants. The next second, the hard skull can no longer stop the blunt bullets, completely cracking... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin handed the pistol to the people around him, glanced down to the ground, and there was a blood-stained Wissen behind him, shaking his head and turning around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Find the car washer, if it is a provincial or Odindin, send them to see the river god. If it is a guar, let him accept The trial of the first king!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wiesen’s body moved, a young man picked up one of his legs, dragged him into the store, and then became proficient The girls washed the blood on the ground in a very short time, as if nothing had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the city, the car washer returned to the house with a bottle of fruit wine. He sometimes went to have a drink, only a drink, his The income can't support his happy drink. But today, not quite the same, he not only gave the cheap and technical woman a dollar, but also bought the big half bottle of fruit wine that he had not finished drinking. This was never thought of before, too luxurious. He pushed open the door, took off his clothes in the dim light, dropped it on the dilapidated sofa, and placed the wine on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes thinking about today’s “income”, he picked up a little song that his mother taught him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
