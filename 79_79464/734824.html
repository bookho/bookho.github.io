			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa’s eyes are almost useless. Except for a dim slow rocking dance floor, only the people here gather the most, she doesn’t quite understand, one The "U"-shaped stage is empty, why are the people here the most? She handed over this question to Du Lin, who answered her question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bar, in addition to some women who are very hot to get off the clothes, sometimes some of the troupe will be invited to perform, or please Popular singers, Acrobatic groups and the like nearby. The higher the bar, the greater the investment in this area. There has been a voice in the society that the future bar will replace the theater to a certain extent, and some bars will even accept entertainment from the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of high-ranking elites sneered at this and thought that they would never enter the bar to have fun in their lifetime, but sometimes the historical trend will not be because A few words of a few people have changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa went to the Grand Theatre, and with her parents, I also watched the performance of the circus, and when Du Lin explained that she sat down. After coming to Tener, she hasn't played well yet. Every day, she is constantly moving between temporary home and work place. Occasionally, some colleagues propose to have a drink, but in the face of men who have a purpose for themselves, Alisa has always refused. She came to Tern, in addition to avoiding the parents' manipulation of her life and destiny, but it was not too much fun, at least until she met Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are drinking and chatting, and the distance between them is getting closer. Under the action of alcohol, the two men stuck together. When Du Lin spoke to Alisa with her head, her lips always inadvertently touched Alisa's ear, which made her feel itchy. This kind of itch is in addition to the body, but also from the depths of the heart. The sprouting thing is growing fast, always swaying her heartstrings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the encounters have made Alisa feel novel, I feel a special fascination, she does not care that Doolin’s lips will touch her. The auricle does not care about the intimate behavior between the two, she enjoys this feeling, and is always happy and happy, like being soaked in a honey pot. She didn't talk about love, I don't know if the feeling of love is like this feeling now, but if it is necessary to add an interpretive feeling to the love, she feels that the current state, the current feeling is the perfect interpretation. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling played Alisa's little hand, Alisa did not object, the two were in such awkward atmosphere, waiting for the start of a new round of performance. Only when the performer walked into the front desk from the stage, Du Lin stunned, because it wasn't a singer, not acrobatics, but a female professional who was so hot that she had to undress. There was some doubt about Alisa. She asked Du Lin on her head. This is the place where the singer is actually dressed like this. She has never seen it before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Du Lin first explained and asked Alisa to leave, then Alisa would definitely leave here with him. After all, Alisa’s opinion on herself is still awkward. baby. However, Dooling did not know whether it was intentional or unintentional. He asked Alisa to leave, but did not give any explanation. This made Ali, who was somewhat normal after the alcohol soaked, categorically rejected Doolin’s request. And asked Du Lin to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin can only tell her that it is a woman who is very hot and often hot to the naked body. If the explanation ends here, Alisa will take the initiative to leave him here, but Du Lin added, "You should not look at this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This made Alisa's rebellious mentality start to re-energize. She held Duolin's hand tightly and looked at him very seriously, even though her eyes were already confused. "Du Lin, I am Adults, do I have my own ability to distinguish and take responsibility? I want to see, can I?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pondered for a moment and finally sat down. Down, it seems that there is some gap between the two because of the small differences. Alisa’s attention gradually shifted to the woman on the stage. She looked at the woman’s face and became more red when she used some special dance moves to highlight her physical features. Some, the eyes also have some dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Du Lin took her hand and made her inexplicably relaxed. She also responded positively and forcedly held it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Alisa saw the men around, whistling, throwing a coin and a group of banknotes on the stage, causing the woman to be stronger After the suggestive action, she suddenly understood why there was a place to exchange change in the aisle, and I understood why there was a special box to hold the change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that some of the dry-skinned Alisa has taken a sip of the scarlet bishop and explained it in the world of Doolin’s dream. The scarlet bishop should be a cup. With a height of about 50 degrees, Alisa untied the button of the coat. When she put the glass, she went to the box with the money on the table. I don’t know what kind of mentality I was driving. She picked up one. A small coin, looking to Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are happy, you can do anything!" When a girl starts to reverse things against alcohol and something that goes against the normal, the best way is to pull her back from the edge of danger in time, rather than deliberately Indulge her. Of course, from the perspective of the parties, persuasion is a humiliation of their will, only indulgence is their affirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa is thrilled to throw about seven or eighty-fifty-five coins on the stage, and the sudden drop of coins makes the women who are eager to dance more hot. She looked up to Alisa and the boy sitting next to Alisa, and stunned with her fascinating eyes. I have to say that these women have a very high professional ethics and professional qualities, they will not take a different attitude because of the gender of the guests who throw coins, even if the girl is throwing coins. Her eyes were filled with a tempting thing, and the tip of the tongue curling over the lips slipped over the lips, giving Alisa a feeling of sorrow, as if she had been shackled by the woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She trembled a little, and cast out more than a dozen coins, so the thunder suddenly caused the blood of other guests, and it was a burst of money, feeling almost The woman was sweating and couldn't help but take off her upper body clothes to cool off. In the roar of the excitement of a ghost crying, Alisa excitedly held three banknotes of one dollar into a group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has seen a word in his dreams, he feels very inspired - if you really love a woman, take him as a daughter to raise Give her all your favors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not stop Alisa, whether he loved or not, in the time of bit by bit, the woman was sweating at the guests Their snoring ended the performance of the show. When she left, she also cast a wink at Alisa. She didn’t drink, and she stood on the stage. Of course, she knew who was the biggest gold tonight. the Lord. Before she came to power, she fancied that she might be a middle-aged man, but she did not expect it to be a girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the girl is coming to the backstage, she doesn't mind having a passionate night with the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s a pity that the girl is not a hunter, Du Lin is, and the goal is the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa, who has finished drinking two scarlet bishops, is already a little drunk. If there is such a drink, Du Lin feels a little surprised, one hundred and fifty milliliters. The whole cup of the cup is even more drinkable than the average man. Of course, even if you can drink enough three hundred milliliters to fill it, you should be drunk. Du Lin walked into the dance floor with Alisa, and in his words it was exercise and loose alcohol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
