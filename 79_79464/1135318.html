			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald is the chess piece of Magus. In their eyes, the powerful Cape family and the sacred consortium were born and played by Magus. The sacrifice of capital power, but they take it all seriously, they are the real victims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are different, we are really pitted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Dulin has been betrayed, whether or not Du Lin knows about it, this is a fact that has already happened. With Du Lin’s character, maybe there will be a day to pack them up. They think that they are better than Todd, and even Todd is cleaned up. It’s even easier to clean them up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they decided to improve their strength and power as soon as possible, to ensure that they really face the day of Doolin, and have the opportunity to take a breather . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how do you improve your strength? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a society where money is above everything else, as long as there is enough money, it is real power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They made a plan and started stealing money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are not just one, three, five, seven, eight, nine, or twenty-two, two, three, four, Even thirty-five six seven eight eight nine is so simple, a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One third of the entire shareholder network was banned, and a small part of the butt was moved back, but most people said that Already gone the black road, then one way to the black. And with so many people united, it is not necessarily true that Du Lin is afraid. And everyone is united, each other holds the black material of each other, as long as the mouth is closed, do not move the action too much, Du Lin will not find the situation here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three or five years, they have enough capital, and they may not be able to sit down with Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, what they don’t know is that Doolin doesn’t really care about their betrayal. When a person is strong enough, he first sees farther. Place, not at the foot. In the eyes of Du Lin at the time, he valued the overall interests of the city of Otis. It was very simple to remove some traitors, but this would cause the city of Otis to be turbulent, create very bad effects and possibly harm the city of Otis. International image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they know, maybe there is no such thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but have to say that their plan is no problem, they bought some of the management of the token company, and then falsely reported the number, hidden in the casino The locality has set up a “convenience redemption service” to directly provide token and cash exchange services. Because there are proof of the token company's authorization, and some of the employees of the token company are here to host the work, some senior guests in the seven major casinos can enjoy the service of redeeming tokens and cash without leaving the casino. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to create a big gap, they are always very careful to redeem the amount, to ensure that Doolin will not be alarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stolen a few hundred thousand today, steal one or two million tomorrow, and sometimes even a low turnover, will take the initiative to report a little more money to balance Branch table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management of the Token Company saw that these big companies are stealing money. It’s unreasonable for us to look at other people’s meat and drink soup, and they can only lick their bones. So some people also moved their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If something goes wrong, just push things to these shareholders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but who knows that Doolin suddenly has a new plan for the token company, to check the accounts. The sudden changes are too late to smooth out the problem. Considering Du Lin’s means and other circumstances, the accounting nerve line responsible for making false accounts is broken, and he chooses to use the method of jumping off the building to make up for his own mistakes. Family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is so relaxed when he jumps, .............................. Hey, free, but everyone else has been pitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don’t jump off the building, you may not have the chance to smooth out the account. After all, the butt of the shareholder is not clean, the token company just doesn’t wipe the butt, those people sit directly On the dung heap. When Du Lin checked them out, they would definitely be more unlucky. It would not be a big problem to get some money from them and smooth out the accounts here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounting for what is your trip? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you jumped off the building, everyone who didn’t understand the fake account couldn’t understand it. It’s too late to find a trustworthy accountant to do this, so a group of people panicked. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only panic, but also cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that is fortunate is that Dooling didn’t pay too much attention to the things inside, leaving only two auditing companies to check the accounts, and he just happened to have more Do more important things to do, so that they have a chance to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they found the person, smoothed out the accounts, and persuaded the employees of the two auditing companies under the coercion and temptation to think that this matter would be fine. Who knows that the auditing company has to do more things, but also took the initiative to say a greeting with Du Lin, pulling Du Lin’s attention back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just this time, it’s not as lucky as the previous few times, because Dooling won’t go to the Token Company, he’s directly from the seven major casino shareholders’ floors. Start checking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about you? Did you do it?" Du Lin looked at Lucius and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucius feels much better at this time, compared to the palm of the napkin and the finger that is soaked in the wine, Du Lin’s now Emotion is the greatest relief to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stumbled and shook his head and said no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not dare, if he dares to be in the middle of Lindys, he will not rely on those skilled women and scammers to make money, precisely because He has more minds and less courage, so he did not betray Doolin. Sometimes courage is also a good thing, at least not too bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought for a moment, he nodded and let people put paper and pen in front of him. "Give me a list, then you can Go to the hospital and ask the doctor if you can connect your fingers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, yes..." Lucius quickly pointed out the people he knew. Written on paper and wrote three sheets of paper. He sneaked a glimpse of Doolin, not seeing how much change Dolin's expression changed, laughing and showing a pitiful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the list and let him go. Du Lin, who was sitting in the restaurant, looked at the night city outside the window, his eyes gradually getting cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people..., according to his temper, it is best to send them to see God, anyway, the old man never dismissed too many people in his kingdom. After all, I have only seen people until now, and I have never seen anyone come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
