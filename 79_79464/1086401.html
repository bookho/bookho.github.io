			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victoria looks not much different from a few years ago, he has his own private medical team, and these heavily hired experts will tell him how to keep him The body does not age quickly, but it also provides a lot of interesting little things to him, which of course costs a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he is in the swimming pool on the top floor of a commercial office building, the entire building is his assets, except for the floors below that are sold or rented, The top floor has always been privately owned and not open to the public, except for occasional lending to friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, inside and outside the swimming pool, more than a dozen famous models and supermodels are playing with him. He likes these girls and is full of energy from these girls. On the body, he seems to be able to feel the breath of his long-lost youth, and this breath makes him very obsessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave his best youth to struggle, and then enjoyed the youth of others after he was old. This is why he strives to make money and is also in life. The greatest source of happiness. Looking at the girls who are much smaller than their daughters, playing around in joy, he laughs and laughs, and the life of the next day is really wonderful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s a pity that his good mood was quickly broken. With the slamming sound, the elevator door on the roof opened and the old man was gloomy. I walked in and looked at the young girls who were looking at him. I didn’t say a word directly to the pool and sat on a lounge chair. He was wearing a formal attire at this time, and he was incompatible with the environment. The two assistants who came in behind him greeted the girl and left. The girls were somewhat unhappy, but they all got a check from the assistant’s hand. They are a little better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicker helplessly took a glass of wine from the tray floating on the water, took a sip, and then swam to the other side of the pool, facing the old man "You shouldn't bother me, it's 'my time'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence makes the old man a bit headache, and the Wichi is one of the few imperial central banks. The alternative, he is not keen on the power in his hands, he prefers to use his mind to enjoy. In his words, it is the money that he has earned enough. He will not be able to count how much money he has with the rest of the time. Why should he work so hard? It's better to think about how to spend the money before you die, enjoy yourself, and find ways to live longer. This made Vicki a special person, and almost everyone liked him because of his personality and because of his generosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a very good friend. Even the old man admits this, but he is definitely not a qualified colleague. He has not demonstrated the ability of a successful person to work at all. Nothing at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man tries not to let his blood pressure rise, his doctor told him that the biggest problem he faces now is his blood pressure, and hopes that he can do as much as possible Things that make you happy, this helps to soothe his emotions and keep his blood pressure from exceeding the critical point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is a very difficult thing to do, just as Vicki likes to enjoy, the old man is keen to control everything, he wants all Everything is in his palm, only then can he be happy. But the problem is that he can't do this and wants to do it, which makes his blood pressure often go away, so that his body is not as good as Vicki. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man who looks at Vicki is actually a little envious, but unfortunately he can’t learn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that you can talk to Doolin, and the matter between us and him needs to be resolved as soon as possible. This is why I am here. You are also The chairman of the bank, you have to take up your responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicker thought about it, and took a very serious point. "You said very much. Reason, I will contact him when I have time, so you can rest assured? Then can you leave, and then return my girls to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The old man is like looking at a mentally retarded watch. "I think you are likely to forget this important thing...", then he turned back and asked the assistant to take the call. Soon the assistant took the phone and dragged a long line to the side of Wichi and placed the phone at the pool. The old man pointed to the phone, "Call now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicker patted the water, the splash was everywhere, he was a little shy "I have a date in the evening! You can't do this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man finally showed a smile, "Take it, or I will help you." Cancel the person who is dating you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicette took a look at the old man and then reluctantly made a phone call, he whispered a few words I hung up the phone and looked at the old man very innocently. "I tried to do what you said, but they don't know where Du Lin is now, so I can't contact him. Don't worry, wait until I have time." Will you contact him again, can you go?", he said that he also raised his arm with nothing, and pointed his finger at the wrist. "Really, I have a date at night..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicki is a very special person. His character and his style have made him have many friends. Whether it is the cabinet of the cabinet or the tramp of some people in the streets, it is possible to chat with the Russians, even Have a drink together and watch the dancing dancers in the cheap bar. He is a real enjoyment of life, plus so rich, everyone has a great affection for him, in some people he is a jerk, but in the eyes of most people, he is a good person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinissa spoke out his impression of Vicki, which made Du Lin feel that this guy was very interesting, except for Kevin’s monk. There are still such interesting people, maybe they will become good friends. He didn't find the strange side of Wix when he last met. He was very serious and even serious. Of course, this may be related to the people present at the time. In addition to Paul of the Ministry of Finance, there are Harry, Mr. Jack, and the nephew of Magus and the agent of Kubar, which can be said to stand in this world tower. A handful of the top of a small group, he does not seem to be the most appropriate choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have heard of your business.", Du Lin bounced the ash, took another sip and smothered the cigarette in the ashtray, he asked Through the sisters of Hill, I also know what kind of situation they are facing. He looks at the two sisters. "I can give you a chance, but what can you give me?" Du Lin leaned on the sofa. "You should be very Clearly, if you want to get it, you have to pay. Sometimes you pay more than you get, but the value is not worth it, but it is another matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In fact... Du Lin’s purpose is very simple, he wants these two girls to work for him. This is not his whim. He didn't think about it, but at the same time he suddenly realized that this is a great opportunity, a good opportunity to change his label. Du Lin has always been labeled with a few mud dog legs. His origin can be said to limit his development. Even Magus has inadvertently mentioned him. If you want a broader future and future, The best way is to find a big aristocratic marriage. As long as his wife is a nobleman, then he is a nobleman, which completely elutes the label of his mud dog legs, and the real top-level society will open the door for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin considered this proposal and has not agreed. He knows the benefits of marrying the big nobility, and it also brings a lot of uncertainty, because there is not only a behavior called "marriage" in the world, but also a result called "divorce." If he divides his family with the marriage because of certain things, his evaluation may be worse than it is now, and this is very likely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those nobles have never seen a person like him. The innate arrogance makes them disdain, even if someone is willing to marry him, it is only the use of each other. Once the other party's request has passed the line, Doolin will certainly refuse, which will lead to inevitable results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a workaround to change this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of what Kevin said to him, not to be independent, it is not good, but also reminds him of the world in the dream, he suddenly When Mao Zedong opened, what he needed was not independent of the mainstream society, but integrated into the mainstream society, so that this society does not distinguish between you and me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initiative of the Shanghai Mayor of the reception sparked his inspiration. He extended this idea to the issue of origin, he had a new idea, if Let the nobles work for themselves, will there be better results? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can try it. If you fail, you won’t lose anything. The only thing that someone else can take is to get some money in his bank account, but in case it succeeds. He will get far more than he has paid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, this is a non-existent business, so there is such a dialogue today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sisters don’t know that Du Lin has so many thoughts, they just think about what they have to do, but after considering them for a long time Did not find the advantages they had in front of Du Lin, they had nothing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, Dinesha asked carefully, "What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your family has served me for 20 years. As long as you nod, I will give you what you want!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls’ hearts suddenly thumped Beating up, I thought I fell into the abyss, but I didn't think that the treasure was actually hidden in the abyss. At this time, the two men were dry and dry, but did not know how to answer this question. Now that the Hill family has had successors, that is their cousin, even if they nod their heads, they can't actually do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Doolin, you know... the home of the Hill family is not us, so we have no way to answer you on this question, maybe we can contact the family. Elders?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
