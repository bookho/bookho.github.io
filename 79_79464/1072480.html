			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If no one raises an objection, I will be here to announce the establishment of the Imperial Insurance Industry Self-Discipline Committee." The representative of the Chamber of Commerce will wear a pair. The representative of the gold-rimmed glasses stood on the stage, and his eyes continued to scan in the venue. This is also a process. In fact, they did not say the announcement. The insurance industry self-discipline committee was established when the approval was down. But this meeting is very important for the two major banks. They need to make the sense of the ritual enough to have a better effect, so that more people can know about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not immediately announce the result, he needs to wait for a while, let the guests who participated in the meeting know that they are not at all guilty, they can accept any objection Anyway, no one will hold any objections in this meeting anyway, isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taylor’s mouth was slightly picked up. After two minutes, the matter could be completely determined. He looked back at the guests who were filled with the meeting room. The pride of this is definitely the most important turning point in his life. From then on, his life, his family and even his future family will be greatly changed by this day. Perhaps many years later, he can also sit in the office like the chairman of the board of directors, and the excellent young people who can be pressed with a gentle eye can't lift their heads. The empire's financial industry will also fluctuate because of his anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the representative of the Chamber of Commerce on the stage and smiled. He picked up the pen and wrote something on the paper in front of him. Maybe one day the paper would become evidence. An important historical proof of history, collected by some museums, or become a famous collection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mouth of the Chamber of Commerce is slowly opening and preparing to speak the last line of the meeting this evening, the door of the conference room is pushed away. It is. In the silent hall of the bird's nest, the sound was exceptionally abrupt. Almost everyone looked back and looked back. I wanted to see what happened. It was so unruly and rude that interrupted the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I object!", Du Lin, whose hair is pressed against the scalp, stepped into the conference hall, and the guard who had just returned to God immediately After relying on the past amount, it was pushed away by several young people and pointed to them to let them back. Du Lin strode forward toward the host, and Taylor's eyelids jumped and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in the middle of watching, watching Du Lin, looking blue. The last time that Du Lin secretly sneaked in the following acquisition contract, the Imperial Central Bank lost a large amount of interest, and finally had to make certain transactions with the Southern Commercial Bank, splitting many interests out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, it is still Doolin. What does he want to do? Why does he dare to do this? Didn't he know that the documents of the Chamber of Commerce have been approved? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the thought of Taylor’s feelings a little relaxed, it is absolutely impossible to have any problems with the relationship between the central bank and the Chamber of Commerce. The field has very close cooperation. If it is not the plate of the Chamber of Commerce, the Imperial Bank has the idea of ​​swallowing the Chamber of Commerce! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at Du Lin, who was striding towards himself, and his face had a little relaxed expression that became so dignified that he They all held their breath. When Du Lin was closer to him, every time Du Lin lifted his foot down, it was like a heavy drum beat on Taylor’s heart, making him tremble once and forever, an unparalleled Strong air waves rushed to the surface, blowing him almost unable to stand up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This... What kind of momentum is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taylor looked at Doolin’s eyes as if he was watching a monster. Behind Doolin, there was a hidden eye in the fog that kept looking at him and let him The dry mouth made him feel sweaty, and the fascination of his eyes made him feel like he was small. What exactly is that, like breathing, every pulsation makes him feel a deep feeling of heart, so that he does not even have the courage to look at Du Lin's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In just a few seconds, Doolin has come to him and glanced at him. He wants to say something, but he can only close his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewfully looked at him with Du Lin’s back, this kind of momentum, this kind of gas field, he only in those directors and more I have seen it in the big mission! He was horrified. This was his first face-to-face meeting with Du Lin. He felt that he had regarded Du Lin as a very powerful person, but he did not expect that he still underestimated him. With only the momentum of an appearance, he lost his weight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I oppose!", Du Lin went to the stage, Kevin asked the representative of the Chamber of Commerce, Du Lin stood at the podium, he pressed his hands At the edge of the podium, leaning forward slightly, looking up at the silent venue of the bird, repeating one side again, "I said, I am against!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taylor, who was shocked by the stunned look, smacked his scalp and immediately turned to look at Doolin, Shen Sheng said, "This is not the place where you are wild, the guard, send him out.", finished this sentence There were thirty seconds of words, and no guards came to Dulin to leave, and Taylor’s expression instantly became awkward. When he bowed his head, he squatted, and the guards on the field were pressed against the wall by the people of Doolin. There was no guard outside the open door, and he and the hotel greeted him. This made Taylor. The heart sinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and looked up at Du Lin. "Mr. Doolin, I respect you as a successful businessman. You should know the importance of today's conference, and we have not invited you to this conference. It’s not where you come to scatter wilderness. If you still think that you are a decent social celebrity, I ask you to leave now.” He looked at Perito after he finished speaking, and Perito’s face was very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin laughed and laughed. He smiled and shook his head and raised his finger at Taylor. "You... is Mr. Taylor?", Doolin knows Perito, once seen in the West, but he has not seen Taylor. "I need to correct you two points. First, you can't afford me. Any normal person will not accept the invitation of the thief party, and the thief. The money for the party was stolen from the pockets of the invitees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second point, I am not here to see your ugly faces, too I don't want any shameless transactions with you. I am here to defend my rights. I want to tell everyone the truth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took his eyes back from Taylor. The guests and reporters who came to the hall to attend the meeting, Lang said, "Ladies and gentlemen, everyone. I stood here in a very impolite manner, perhaps disturbing everyone, I am very good at it. Sorry, but I have reason to stand here, just like I just That way, a group of thieves stole the keys to my house. They didn't hide themselves. Instead, they held such a grand consciousness to tell others that they were the masters of the house because they had keys in their hands."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is a joke, thieves are always thieves, no matter if they have keys, as long as they have been thieves, they will never wash this layer of skin!" Lin said that the smashing of the iron, suddenly let some people in the conference hall have shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very simple and obvious thing, Du Lin is not that kind of fame and no one. Even if Doolin didn't introduce himself, he went to the station on the stage. Ninety percent of the people in the conference hall recognized Du Lin, and 10% of the people after Taylor shouted the name of Doolin. Recognized him. He is not a dispensable social marginal person. He has enough fame and has enough status in society. Du Lin’s reputation is very good. At least for the time being, he did not go to court because of the tearing agreement, nor because The problem in business is being scolded by scandals. He is a very credible person. This is a consensus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the effect of fame and status. If someone who doesn’t know who is standing here is arrogant, the person here will think that he is lying. But when they changed Du Lin, they began to think and began to wonder if there was any other inside story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
