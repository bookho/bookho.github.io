			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin knows that these people are in the pit, but he still bravely jumped, he is not afraid of being buried, he has more than this world too much Advanced concept, this is his biggest reliance! Others are planning to dig a pit to bury him, but who knows who will be buried in this pit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was three to ten minutes, the Buddha was a little impatient. He frowned and looked at Delil, who was frightened. I opened my eyes. At this time, he suddenly pointed to the street outside the coffee shop. There was a very fashionable woman holding a handbag in his hand to cover the sun and walked over to the coffee shop. She wore a pair of sunglasses and covered most of her face. Now, Mrs. Vivian is also a "star figure". The feminist slogan of the feminist shakes the world, as the first woman of Cannes, many Everyone knows her from the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is both a star and a political figure. More and more politicians realize that although women’s status is not obvious, they still have a certain right to speak in the family. No one has ever considered winning votes in the hands of female voters. They always think that as long as they persuade men in the family, they will certainly let women in the family vote for them. Until one thing happened some time ago, when the feminist fighter Hathaway of Lakran State announced that he wanted to run for the mayor, tens of thousands of women took to the streets and said that they would vote for Hathaway, which caused politicians. They are really concerned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the real reason why Mrs. Vivienne dared to divorce Peter. She not only has her own independent power, but also has a political status. It can even be said that Peter's political potential is not as strong and representative as Mrs. Vivian. Hathaway’s participation in the campaign is like a bowl of water in the unrolled oil. The entire political arena has been shaken so much. If Mrs. Vivian is also announcing her election? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will anyone want to support her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is she still attached to Peter’s side, and when I meet outside political people with a little power, why do people want to introduce themselves to this? Is the wife of Mayor of Peter, not "This is Ms. Vivian?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she has to fight, she has understood this truth since that night, as Du Lin said, you are not fighting, nothing. But you fight, maybe you have what you want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put the bag in her hand when she opened the door and walked into the coffee shop. Her eyes didn't stop when she swept through Du Lin, because she was facing her side, so she didn't notice it. Buddha. Soon, she found Delier sitting by the window, and after the waiter took a glass of ice water, she frowned slightly and reached the table next to it with ice water. "You don't feel there. "Is it hot?", then she pointed to the seat next to her, "Sit over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be independent for a long time, and it is also a very famous feminist With her own family and environmental influence, Mrs. Vivienne's tone was accompanied by a commanding tone, which she did not find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreil had some dilemmas. In the faint disappointment of Mrs. Vivienne, she could only helplessly refer to the table of Doolin. To offend Du Lin, you may have to fight a fight. Although it will hurt for a long time, it may break your nose, but there will always be a cure for the injury. Can offend Mrs. Vivian, he may soon be unable to afford even the food, after weighing the gains and losses, he made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivienne looked at Delier, and she seemed to have seen such Delier in her memory, timid, wronged... She looked in the direction he pointed. Du Lin smiled and nodded at her. She was unclear and returned, and she searched for memories and didn't know this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Du Lin at this time is completely different from the previous one. The last time he saw Mrs. Vivian, he was wearing a wet police uniform. With a police cap, and the time is very short, Mrs. Vivian is not impressed with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Du Lin is wearing the clothes that Irian’s best tailors have hand-stitched, whether it’s the neckline or the cuffs, it’s enough to match the craftsmanship of the Emperor’s big tailors. . Just this dress alone can raise the identity of the person more than one step, so Mrs. Vivienne hollowed out her mind and couldn’t remember who the seemingly rich and expensive teenager was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when she looks at another side face, the whole person has an instant loss, the side face is too familiar, familiar with her can draw it by hand . She just took a look, then took out a two-piece banknote from the handbag and put it on the table. She got up and left. She didn't know why she was leaving, but she had a desire and urgency to make her feel that she had to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was still a step late, and when she was about to leave the coffee shop, she grabbed her arm. The gentle heat passed from the palm of Dufo's hand to Mrs. Vivian's arm. She felt a little flustered, turned her face back and looked at her Buddha. "What do you want to do? If you If you are so arrogant, I want to be a person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter on the side noticed the situation here. He quickly came over and wanted to open the two. Du Lin was between the waiter and the Buddha. He explained with a smile. "We are all friends, and we have a little contradiction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...", the waiter was hesitant I glanced at Mrs. Vivian, who felt that Mrs. Vivienne should be a big man because she had a different temperament. As for Du Lin and Dudu, although they are very advanced, they are too young to be ignored. Eventually the waiter decided to help the lady, even if they were friends, helping the lady to be a gentleman's virtue, and forgive them for nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very serious from the side of Du Lin, while walking towards the two, while watching the Buddha, "Ms. Do you need help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin frowned. He suddenly found himself a little uncomfortable with this place, because he had no sense of existence here. If you are in Irian, I am afraid that Du Lin will not need to stand up. Someone will explain to those who don’t know what happened. After all, Mr. 350,000 is getting more and more famous and can help Du Lin solve even one. It’s not a hassle, you can mix your face, maybe you can use it when you can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here, not many people know who he is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took the waiter’s shoulder and took another twenty dollars out of his pocket. “I invite everyone to have a drink, let me handle it here. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 20-dollar waiter in Du Lin’s hands is very excited. There are five tables in the whole cafe, which is less than fifteen. Everyone has a cup of coffee for a dollar, and he can still drop seven or eight dollars. This is about ten days of salary. But he still refused Doolin's goodwill, shook his head firmly, then forcibly turned around and pressed his palm to the shoulder of Dudu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delier watching the show immediately covered his eyes and looked at the street outside the glass wall. In the next second, Du Lin picked up the table. The pencil used to draw the point menu was stabbed directly from his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who watched the show were shocked. Apart from a table of three young people, others left some coffee to leave the coffee shop. A bloodshed has occurred, and the police will be involved. These people will be taken back as witnesses to record their confession. What if the two young people are gangs? That is to get into trouble, they just want to spend some time here, not to cause trouble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
