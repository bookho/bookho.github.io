			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;July 7th, sunny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sudden heavy snow, the sun is as good as ever, so that the entire city of Otis is like being locked in a steamer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather in July, even in the middle of the empire, could not be suppressed and began to heat up rapidly. According to the weather report, the daytime temperature in Otis is 27 degrees. Between thirty-one degrees, this temperature is enough to make people fear. But today, if you don’t go out, you can’t go out. A grand charity auction is about to begin. All the people who are invited are heads and faces. If you lose your face, you will offend Du Lin. The only thing you can do is to open the room. Door, then go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original plan was a charity party, but there were a lot of people coming. There are no hotels or venues in Otis to fully accommodate all guests and service personnel. Finally, the time of the charity auction was re-booked during the day, and the venue was set on the lawn of the most luxurious clubhouse in Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of tender green turf and white cloth exhibition style gives a feeling of vitality and purity. Once you enter the venue, you will be able to I saw Du Lin as the representative of the charity auction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is chatting with a cardinal sent by the church at this time. The church has awarded two medals to Doolin, although Du Lin did not take it. But they all mailed it over and registered it to hang Duling's photos in the most prominent places of the Hall of Fame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the church’s development in recent years is very slow. The rise of the imperial economy has made people pay more attention to economic effects. People have set their sights on how to earn more. In the matter of money, the issue of faith is neglected. Because the work makes money, you can fill your stomach and support your family. You can let your wife put on good-looking clothes, let the children go to school, and add some furniture to the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But believe in God, his old man, these are not available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the only religious newspaper, the Gospel, the church’s archbishop published an article asking everyone, whether the satisfaction of harvesting money can Better than the peace of mind? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is of course "yes". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop believes that people are now lost in the fantasy of money making, ignoring the satisfaction of the soul, forcing themselves to become a dead body without faith, has become An unsound human being. The so-called sound human beings must have a devout faith. It is the old man who led the human beings to enter the civilized era from the wild age, and let the sun shine on the earth and warm the hearts of the people, but people forget where the soul is. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument was spurred by a group of sociologists, and the church’s talents also played with the group of sociologists in the newspaper for a while. Finally it is gone. But this also reflects the most realistic problem in today's society, that is, money is more important to life than to faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the church feel bad about it. Less and less believers in the membership mean that the influence of religion is getting weaker and weaker. Over the years, it has been in the royal family and the cabinet. Depressing the church has reached the most dangerous time in history. Once the problem of believers breaking or even severing, it is very likely that it will really affect the inheritance of faith. For this reason, many church leaders are trying their best to expand the impression of the church. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The award of a church medal to a celebrity is one of the cheapest and best tricks. Du Lin is definitely not the only person who has received a church medal in these years. He is only the most famous one, and the church has received some good returns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Du Lin invited the church to participate in this charity auction, and included the church into one of the organizers, so that the church executives were very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good signal. Maybe Du Lin wants to change the door and not believe in God to believe in God? Together with the gorgeous invitation list, Asahi City immediately sent a cardinal to participate in this charity auction, giving Du Lin's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, they are not clear, the cabinet is going to let go of some restrictions on religious beliefs. Magus promised that Dulin would use legislation to ensure the equal relationship between the clan and the freedom of belief, which means that various religious organizations will spring up after the next period of time. And it is possible to grow three or five meters in height overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religion, faith, has always been the most vigilant thing of the rulers, let go of some of the religious, then there must be a means to control the counter, cabinet The idea was to set up a new institution, the Imperial Religious Authority, to do these things, and to re-engage the church and confront the upcoming religious beliefs. With official policy support, if the Church of the Lord of Heaven is still unable to beat these scattered little religions, then the church can die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These high-level information has not been fully revealed. Du Lin does not mind using this opportunity to be a good person first. The church is still in the same stage. After some bans are released, there will be a short period of eruption. As a necessity, Du Lin, who is responsible for the mission of the Glorious King and the gods, naturally closes with the church first, so that the initial development of the gods will not be deliberately targeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I was in the Imperial Capital, I went to some places with Ophelia and participated in the church organization's giving activities. I deeply felt that we did not notice in this society. In the corner, there are some poor people who urgently need our help." Du Lin smiled and looked at the cardinal who was wearing the purple rim of the golden rim, and talked about the people he took with Ophelia in the emperor. Small activities, at this time, his face is sad and sorrowful. "Everyone has come to the world when he comes to the world. They are blessed by the gods and God. They come from the fruit of the fruit, equal to the world, but in In the process of growing up, I encountered some terrible things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They need help, and we have the ability, we can also lend a helping hand to help them, this is A very meaningful thing is also the main reason why I organized this charity auction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can't because our eyes don't look at the shadows. Place, I think those places don't exist, I In the name of the individual, Tian will donate one million to the church. I hope that the church can persist in the belief in the life of the people and care for all those in need!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the people in Du Lin are exuding the glory of holiness. Even the cardinal thinks it is a bit dazzling. Of course, for Du Lin’s question of lifting the gods and the Lord of Heaven to the same height, the cardinal thinks that It is not a problem at all. With Doolin’s one million base, if the donation is only three or five hundred, it will only be self-sufficient. When I think that this charity auction may create millions of money, Du Lin’s image is A lot taller, the cardinal also decided to go back and discuss with you, and then give Du Lin another medal and so on to praise his actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the glory of God fill the world!", the cardinal is slightly dagger, his voice is very magnetic, like a lot of scammers, very gentle At the same time, it is attractive. "Mr. Du Lin, your recognition of charity and love and your attitude can't be covered by the sun. This society is just like the kind of person you are so caring, has become so turbid. I represent the church. And the Pope’s deepest respect to your kindness and kindness!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said what he thought of here. "At the end of this year, there was a grand celebration to commemorate and celebrate the birth of His Holiness Pope. All the church leaders and enthusiasts of all walks of life will come here. I am here in a eager period. I hope that you can also come to the sunset city, if you have time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not refuse, "Of course, please give me an invitation, I must Will go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cardinal is overjoyed and said that someone will send the invitation later. Now there are so many problems in the church, that is, they need these rich and helpful help. The more money they donate, the more activities the church will give in various places. The more beneficiaries, the more potential groups of potential believers will increase. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them chatted a few words and the cardinal was very acquainted. He and Du Lin had been talking for so long. It’s hard to get there. There are still many people around. Waiting to talk to Du Lin alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second one to find Du Lin is Henry, this guy is also invited, as the son of the steel tycoon, just this name is enough to give Most people have a shocking effect. Behind every industry trust is an uncountable interest group. In most ordinary people's eyes, the steel tycoon is just the title of a person, but in the capital, this title is behind countless capital. crocodile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry seems to be somewhat more modest than the cardinal of the cardinal... Du Lin can also appreciate the feelings of his father and his brother. He asked Du Lin directly, "How much should I donate, how to donate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this question asking for export? Of course, this is the meaning that Du Lin asked him to come, but some things can't be said so directly, aren't they? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like "Why don't you stay in the night," so the subtle but clear expression of all the content of the sentence is compared to the "I want you to grass me" such a red fruit The sentences are more in line with contemporary values, and are more acceptable to people and have a higher artistic style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this mentally retarded child, Dooling did not blame him, just whispered a few words and sent him and his little girlfriend away. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Henry’s cynical expression and the little girl around him, Du Lin suddenly felt that this might be the real life winner, not too much too complicated. Things, just be happy. For example, he just shot a one-million-level production for his little girlfriend, two major studios participated in it, and Du Lin’s TV group also blended one hand. This movie will not only be comprehensive in the theater. Released, also accepted TV on demand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
