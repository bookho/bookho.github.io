			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time since Wood’s success that he has become awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed a vase on the ground, and his so-called gentleman’s grace had long since disappeared, and the meticulous hair was indiscriminate. I am pulling, just like I have just experienced a storm. In the slightly open mouth, a stream of hot air spewed out. He gasped and walked back a few steps and sat in a chair in the storage room. The exquisite vest button also collapsed, and the high-end shirt neckline was torn open to a large extent, revealing some black chest hair. He was like a beast hiding in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was threatened and wanted to fight back, when he asked Ernst and Karel that everyone should push down those who did not follow the rules. At the time, Ernst was silently silent, and Karur was also. How could Wood, who had been fighting with them for more than a decade, could not guess their thoughts. Like the people outside, they were waiting for him to show his weakness, showing the weak side, and then tearing him into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people divide the private wine market in a city, how can two people, even one person, dominate and be happy? As early as a few years ago, Wood knew that the so-called "three giants" would have a battle in the future. The reason for keeping them peaceful is not the shit rules, but the lack of an opportunity to start a war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the opportunity to start the war has emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once he can’t handle this well, let everyone know that “Woodwood” is still the one who dared to cut people with an axe. Piece of thugs, those people dare to become mobs to give him points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, it is an easy task, but it is not easy to do. Just as Wood intended to prove that he was still a long way from the "old", he suddenly found out that he knew nothing about his opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many people are there, he doesn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main members of the other party, he only knows a singer called Graf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is planning what he is now, he does not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows almost nothing about his own opponent. Even worse, he doesn't know how to start! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many years of "gentleman" career made him forget that he is a thug, a bloody "coward". He used the things of the upper class to decorate his facade like a church, and even he almost really wanted to be a monk in the church. Suddenly, let him return to the time when he was struggling with the line of life. His first feeling was that he was not comfortable, and there was a kind of uneasiness that made the heart beat fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His trembling hand took out a cigarette case from his pocket, pulled out one and gave it to himself. His eyes gradually became violent in the smoke. He threw the remaining cigarette butts on the ground, picked up his sleeves, took the felling axe that had been hung behind the storage room door, and squatted. Hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When pushing the door of the storage room, there are many people standing outside. These people are his men, including his loved ones, his friends, and his assistants who accompanied him from hell to heaven. His eyes are very firm, just like on that night many years ago, there has never been such a certainty - we are invincible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of old people are full of excitement, especially when they see the felling axe in Wood, the blood seems to be boiling at this moment, whether it is sitting, or Lying down, I stood up at this time and surrounded it. They didn't make any noise, so they surrounded Wood in the middle and looked at him with trust and adoration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Wood felt a feeling that he was almost forgotten in the "gentleman career", a feeling full of power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boss, what do we do now?", the chubby chubby Jim wore a brown vest, and the belly seemed to contain a bag of flour. There is a layer of greasy sweat on the brain that has already been radiant. He is one of Wood's former cuddly men, and he also has his title in the city of Tener - the mincer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim now runs a pet shop that focuses on pet food and some strong dogs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His pet shop is one of the strongholds that Wood used to destroy the corpses, they will quietly kill their opponents and then send them to pets. In the store. Jim will pick up the knives that his father gave him and hope he can become a good cook, divide the victim into small pieces, add some ingredients, put them in the oven and simply dehydrate them. A piece of thumb-sized piece of meat, mixed with other pet food, sold to pets throughout the city of Tyne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His business was very hot at first, but as Wood's status became higher and higher, his pet shop was on the verge of bankruptcy. There are very few guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood’s gaze swept across everyone’s face and finally stayed on Jim’s face. “First find out how many people are there, who is it, What is the name, what kind of social relationship. Find out their dens and give them a big gift." He looked at Jim, and Jim nodded slightly. "Jim, you go check one. What kind of place does the husband usually like to appear? By the way, check out what family he has."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim’s wife is a Guar, he can use the power of his wife. From the inside of the Guar people, the news will be much more accurate and more real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roben, take back our things in the western suburbs, now we need him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Roben is a tall, tall man in his forties. His face is a little sallow, because his thinness makes his eyes look big and his face looks malnourished. He used to be Wood's "head of logistics", mainly responsible for some things like appliances, and won the trust of Wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Wood became a member of the upper class, in order to make his face look as good as possible, he hid many things and hid them. Everywhere in the city. There are several pistols in the western suburbs, and some of the cold weapons that have been modified are used in battles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robbed his mouth and smiled, raised his hand and made a military ritual of the Yaoxing Empire soldiers. "Follow the boss, you can see those little cute tomorrow." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jiji, bring two people tomorrow, help me get 100,000 pieces out, and have a denomination of five dollars!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吉吉 is not tall, the facial features are very correct, the national character face, thick eyebrows, looks like a decent person more than his gang ingredients. His body looks very strong and his shoulders are very wide. He did the athletes for a while before following Wood. Later, because of the war and other reasons, the sports club in the city of Tener was disbanded. He lost his source of life and was only able to play black boxing on the underground platform. Before he was discovered by Wood and signed into his own hands, he had successfully killed three people in the ring, and he was called a "clawed Jiji". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
