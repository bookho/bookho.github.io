			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much courage can people face when they die? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This requires reference to the number of people who face the death directly. In some religious people, death is just a new beginning, even happiness. The starting point, for these people, death is not daunting, as long as the way of death is correct, then he will feel happiness and satisfaction, not fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if it is a gang? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No belief can support the weight of the soul, and death becomes infinitely horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the cold metal material on the brain, this guy's face changed a bit, then became calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he doesn’t believe that this little guy in front of him really dares to kill himself, he is the man of "Woodwood", with Wood in the city of Tener. Prestige and status, it is not just what anyone does to him. So there wasn’t much fear on his face, even a hint of pride. “You have the ability to...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s fingers pulled the trigger and the gun The bullet was sprayed at a speed of 350 meters per second, and the sharp warhead directly smashed the guy's skull. Under the resistance, the hollow tail of the warhead began to eversion under the great force, completely turned through the brain tissue, with a sharp tearing metal edge, flipped and easily worn out from the back of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A snoring sound, the guy’s brain suddenly spewed out a bloody fog with a lot of red and white pieces. The smell suddenly filled the air, and the guy leaned back with the head moving backwards, then fell forward and fell to Doolin's feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back of the brain broke open a big hole in the fist, more than half of the things have been sprayed out, thick plasma in the middle of the night is still a trace of heat. The other two people finally had no calm or awkward look, and they were terrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man is not afraid of being crazy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are Wood's men, he is not afraid of Wood's newspaper...mmp, he does not know our identity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guys looked at the dead companions, how strange it was to say how strange the face was, they really thought too much, not everyone must know them. Just like in the city of Tener, few people know Du Lin. Sometimes people can't associate fame with a specific thing, let alone at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked down at the splashed blood on his pajama pants, kneeling down and sticking a finger off, rubbing it on the guy’s shoulder I don’t know what to say in my mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly went to the second person and put the gun on his head in the same way. "Hey, he thinks I might I won’t shoot, so I was shaken by his scared hand. Now you can tell me who you are, why are you following my carriage, and what are you going to do?” The man just wanted to speak. Du Lin’s other hand was lifted up, and the index finger was erected between the lips, and a motion was banned. “Hey... think first, then answer my question after thinking clearly, otherwise I might be afraid to Shake it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy actually secreted a layer of delicate sweat on his forehead in this cold eye! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin can feel that his body is shaking slightly, people are so strange, if you do not see the same kind of death in front of yourself, it is difficult to break out of complexity And blazing feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting for about a dozen seconds, Doolin nodded. "Now, have you thought about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking, we are Wood's people..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone's eyes are on the third person, the last person On the body, and the second, that is, Dulin’s guy with his gun in his head turned his head and looked at his very good companion on weekdays. He actually learned to answer the question when he was terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the gunshot sounded, and the second guy fell to the ground with unwillingness and resentment, just like the guy before, Du Lin for him The head opened a window, hoping that he would become smarter if he had a next life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the so-called unwillingness and resentment do not exist, because when the bullet penetrates his brain, his eyeballs have begun to turn around. Finally turned white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After shooting two people, Du Lin put away the pistol. He looked at the third person. "Congratulations, you have learned to answer. Can I ask your name?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Johnny!", the man said quickly, "Sir, my name is Johnny, I am..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin The finger was on Johnny’s lips and looked at him very seriously. “I asked, you answered!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnny nodded, he felt like he was going Crazy, actually want to pee at this critical time, but he dare not say it, and can not help. The damp heat touched the thighs to the knees, and the cold wind seemed to be cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Question One, Who is Wood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnny swallowed, flying fast In answer, "Wood is our boss. He has a nickname, Woodwood. The whole smuggling and sale of the whole wine of Tyner is controlled by Wood and two others. They control the high-alcohol of the whole Tnel. Market."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, the answer is very detailed, I am very satisfied, this is a reward for you, I know you need this.", Du Linna A cigarette was stuffed into Johnny’s mouth, and then he took out the kerosene lighter and ordered him. “So now the second question, who made these rules of the game?”<br /><br />&nbsp After a couple of cigarettes, Johnny’s mood was slightly calmer, and the brain became clearer from the confusion. He said a little, he said: “It’s what Ernst put forward, it’s said to be behind him.” Standing the mayor and some tycoons, Wood and Karur... It’s another guy, they don’t dare to be right with Ernst. In order to agree to Ernst’s request, the rules of the game were established.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Question 3, what do you want to do today?”, see Johnny. Hesitant and hesitant, Du Lin reached out and patted the cheek of Johnny, who was slightly hiding. "I talk and count, and you see, there is no one but you, no one knows what you said." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps Du Lin’s attitude touched him, so he said it on the 15th and 10th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood asked them to stare at Graf, find his stronghold, and figure out the staffing. Wait until the middle of the night to touch the unimportant person, grab Graf and the person who is sleeping in the same room as the money, and bring it back. Wood believes that the person who sleeps in the same room as the money, even if he is not the home of Graf, must know who is the home. After all, there are 10,000 blocks in total, and no one can give this money to Graf for safekeeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you can find a home, the rest will be easier. Whether it's a shot or a shot, it's just a drizzle for the three private tycoons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After asking all the questions he wanted to know, Du Lin took out the pistol and took away the fate of Johnny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to explain why he violated his promise, and Du Lin added, "I didn't allow you to answer!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He threw the pistol at the Buddha, he believed that he could manage this thing, at least he could be smarter than Graf to know what to do. He took out the handcuffs from his pocket, wiped the blood stains on his fingers, and pointed to the three bodies on the ground. "Put their clothes down and burn them, and send them to the back ground with the two policemen." The police clothes are also smashed down, and they are hidden after they are packaged, and they may be used later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After doing this, rest, they I won't be coming back tonight." After all, Du Lin shook the draped clothes and returned to the house, shaking his head as he walked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy called Wood is really ugly, but today, whether it is Du Lin or Wood, there is no room for relaxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dispute between gangs and forces is not as easy to solve as business and politics, and commercial disputes are nothing more than the distribution of interests, whoever makes one step Can get the perfect solution. The political dispute is just the unequal trade, with one more chip or one less chip, and a little compromise, there is nothing wrong with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the dispute between the gang and the forces is different. It is the law of the jungle that is about the natural selection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every gang, power has its own territory and scope, like a lion. And those little gangs, small forces, such as Du Lin, such as newcomers, are like a hyena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion is not afraid of walking the dog. When the lion’s anger is screaming, the dogs will choose to leave because they know that they are not The majestic lion's opponent. But if the lion is provoked by a hyena but does not make enough counterattacks, other hyenas hiding in the dark will flock, and they understand that the lion in front of him is old or injured. Or because of something else. In short, it reveals the weak and weak side, and this will make the hyenas ecstatic, they will not hesitate to rush to tear the lions in the ordinary days into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
