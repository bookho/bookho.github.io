			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would it be too exaggerated?", Du Lin sat in the car and looked at the posters on both sides of the street, almost covered by the bust of Doolin. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Hall has given Du Lin three notices of punishment because he did not paste posters in the licensed area, so he violated the city law and accepted every A fine for a piece of money... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this fine is not in Du Lin’s eyes. For every dollar paid, his illegally posted posters can last for 72 hours. . Sometimes it is not the city hall that does not act, but it involves a lot of exchanges and interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A city, tens of thousands of posters with erroneous places, can bring more fiscal revenue to the government than other incomes, who can, who dare to break This financial road? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More, the person on the poster is Du Lin, the omnipotent Doolin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hellman, sitting next to him and accompanying him, smiled and smiled and shook his head. "This is normal, isn't it? In the next stage, we will Print at least 150,000 short-sleeved stalks with slogans and distribute them to the voters who support you. Each person can receive a subsidy of five dollars a month!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Du Lin smiled a few times and ridiculed, "So political candidates who do not have the support of capital will never have the chance to go to the front. This is a pathological political phenomenon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no rebuttal to this Hellsman. "This is the rules of the game. Maybe the designers of the rules at the beginning did not want it to become like this. This is the choice of society!" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are indeed true. In fact, there are many very good politicians in the middle and lower levels of the empire. These people have the idea of ​​being more complete and more suitable for the current society. Political programs, but they cannot be understood by people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are they not good at showing themselves? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course not, any politician is a communicator, and what they lack is only those capitalists who appreciate them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, policies that are beneficial to the people often hurt the interests of capitalists, such as the Law on Minimum Wage and Labor Security Law, which protects the rights of ordinary people. They greatly protect ordinary people. Legitimate rights and interests make it difficult for capitalists to bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalists can no longer legally exploit workers, and can’t just find a reason for contract workers to get out, maybe just because he takes more than others Five wages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these socially responsible politicians, the capitalists will not hold them. Once these politicians grow up, they want to eat people, eat capitalists, not Provide the capitalist with a knife and fork to engulf the wealth of society. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the politicians who are closer to the capitalists who will get more resources. They always wear a pair of pants with the capitalists and are more adept at lying and making shows. This has more exposure opportunities and is recognized by more voters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold always shines? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing someone has to dig it out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car passed through several streets and stopped outside a small park that was not too spacious. This was the first stop for Doolin’s public speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called public speech, in the words of Hellsman, is to deceive the masses, to say that some of these voters like to listen, what they care about, what to say, as for It doesn't matter if you can do it. At the end of the term, you can push things you can't do to the politicians and supporters in hostile positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are long-standing obstacles of this group of opponents. If you can’t do these things, you’re not doing it, but the resistance is too big, oh, just because I have to These things, maybe I can't choose now... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of people gathered in the park. Du Lin just got off the bus and these people looked at him and applauded. Du Lin found a very interesting manifestation. The middle class and the low-yielding proletariat were clearly divided into two camps, and there was an invisible gap between them to separate them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and walked into the park, and shook hands with some people. It took ten minutes to finish the distance of thirty or forty meters and came to the small park. On the high platform in the middle - temporary build, someone in the campaign team is responsible for similar things, like the professional brokerage companies behind Xie Lisi Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you... Thank you for leaving the warm bed on Sunday morning, leaving your family to come here, listening to the voice of a young man like me, thank you for your recognition and support...", Du Lin looked down With a look at the manuscript under the microphone, he should have continued to read it according to the manuscript, but he suddenly took the speech and lifted the manuscript in an exaggerated way, then used a little interpretation. Read a few words about the style of dressing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are watching him silently, don’t know what happened, Hersman sitting in the car closed his eyes, he knew, "Du Lin The moment has begun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He read two sentences and then looked at everyone. "They gave me a manuscript and told me to read it out according to this manuscript, then Avoiding some sharp problems, people will like me..." After a second, he suddenly extended another hand to tear the speech off and smashed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to the horse's speech, go to the horse to avoid sharp questions!", he is confident that the temperament of this moment, reflected in the sun To the fullest extent, he licked his collar and held both sides of the podium with his hands. The body leaned forward and leaned closer to the microphone. "I came to solve the problem. I am concerned about the status quo of life in all walks of the west. I am not here to act. If someone wants to act, then he should go to the opera house or the cinema instead of standing here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the land under his feet, "No Standing here, standing in the sun, standing in front of the people, there is no sorrow to lie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, people are just as waking up, Excited applause and whistling, they liked Du Lin, who is different from other politicians. There is something different in him that attracts everyone's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the excited crowd, Du Lin raised his hand and let them quiet down. There is only Du Lin’s voice in the park. “Politics should never be A ridiculous draft event, all voters should not support such a draft, because you are not choosing the next generation of idols, but will decide that you will influence you in all aspects for the next eight years or even longer. Policy makers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly someone raised a question, "Mr. Doolin, you mean that other candidates are acting, deceiving voters. Is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countless eyes were concentrated on this person, Du Lin looked at him, and then pointed his finger at him. "This is a sharp question. According to the normal steps, I should open this question and say something unrelated." And then avoid it.", people made a burst of laughter, it seems that those politicians are doing this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I am not a politician who is well known. I am Doolin. I am different and will not evade this issue..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think I mean some people are acting, cheating voters...", the whole park is quiet again, this is a very special problem, because Du Lin is likely to offend most politicians. People want to see how he answers. Du Lin smiled confidently. He smiled and nodded. "There are some people here who really want to see me and What is different from others, want to know what I will say to pull the ballot, and some, like the gentleman to see the lively."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I am satisfied with your lively mentality. My answer is 'yes'!", regardless of people's exclamations and those who started to meet a lively event, Du Lin continued, "Let's calmly think about it, How many politicians have been in front of you before, and promised you how to have a bright future in the future. No matter what their differences are, the ultimate core is the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed at these people, pointing at pieces, "They tell you, After they come to power, you will have endless money, medical expenses will be reduced, education expenditure will be reduced, everyone will have a satisfactory job, and life will be better, just like living in heaven!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed his hands to the podium, and the voice became very hot. "But look at you now, in the past seven years, seven years ago. In the eight years of eight years or more, do you feel that you live in heaven?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to those who have really gone to heaven, I have not been there, so I am not sure whether the heavens they went to are the same as the heavens described by these people, but the facts are in front of you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Some of you are still poor, still have no work, still do not look down on the disease, still have no money to support themselves. ? & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp children to get a better education, life is still poor, which is the kingdom of heaven right "<br <br /> & nbsp />;</div>
