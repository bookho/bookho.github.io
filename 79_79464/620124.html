			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes Mr. Xema is really very interesting, because he does not act like a farmer who is a book, and may use it here. The word division will cause misunderstanding, but this is the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when Du Lin, who has already "flyed up", took out five thousand pieces of Mr. Maxma to help him with a "small busy", he may not see it for a lifetime. Mr. Kesma, who had spent such a large sum of money, was not excited. His hands were not shaking, just like the five thousand pieces on the table, only fifty, or five dollars. His gaze only stayed on the banknote for about 0.5 seconds, and he returned to Doolin's face without any reluctance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want me to do for this farmer?" Mr. Xerma moved his butt back and made his back fit more into the wicker chair. The backrest is in a sitting position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is organizing the language, and the time in the city makes him understand the truth. Sometimes the word contains more than the word. Literally, in a nutshell, everything that can be turned into actual benefits, such as money, men, power, status, prestige, etc., can be described by the word truth. When the social class and the soft and hard power of the two people are almost the same, the "reason" can use the mouth to "speak". At other times, as long as there is a certain aspect of unequal, it is very likely that "reason" is not used. But do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to improve your "reasonable" level? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin considered many aspects, such as white gloves that became a big man like Wood and Goldor, or "cleaned up" Doffer, but these roads not only require him to have stronger strength and power, but also need time to accumulate. Trusting a person is not a matter of three or five days, or three or five sentences. It takes a long time to accumulate. The opposite is that it takes only a moment to destroy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin needs a solid foundation, not a pavilion on the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants Mr. Xerma to help buy another sheriff in the town - can be read as a sheriff. In the Great Patriotic War, that is, during the Civil War, in order to effectively resist the pervasive federal army, the empire complied with the recommendations of the ministers of the then prime minister, allowing all localities to have the power to form a guard, especially in the countryside, such as the town, or It is a village. The ultimate executor of this order is the sheriff of each town, who will become the leader and commander of the local guard. And the empire has opened another authority for these sheriffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can use low-cost money to buy standard rifles in the Armaments, even war machines and weapons platforms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy has played a miraculous effect in the war. It turns out that the richer the more people, the more afraid of death. In the early days of the war, the nobles They still occupy the land of the Empire, and they are the landowners in the real sense. At the same time, these nobles were also at the forefront of the war, either "donating money" to the sheriff to form a local guard, and for them to buy weapons and other higher-level armed forces to resist intruders that may occur anywhere, anytime. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either honestly fleeing the emperor, and then frustrated to receive the territory was swept by war, the tragedy of wealth and real estate was looted and destroyed. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at that time many nobles had bitterly bitten their teeth and used a lot of money to arm the local guards, many places on the aristocratic territory with a long history. The degree of armed forces of the Guard is even worse than that of the regular army of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were pitted. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new decree issued by the Emperor of the Empire, the Special Regiment Act during the Great Patriotic War was passed in the Imperial Capital, the local guards who were heavily armed to the teeth were re-established. It became a regular army, which means that the empire used the army assembled by the nobility to fight, and did not have to pay any price. Although many of the nobility have a lot of grievances and dissatisfaction, considering the consequences of the failure of the war, they can only smash their teeth and swallow their stomachs, but also reveal a "I am willing to pay for the empire." Everything's expression. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war, a large number of troops from the nobility and the Guar and the provincial sages were on the battlefield, letting the class contradictions that were already erupting Got a break. At the same time, according to the conspiracy theorists, the imperial royal family colluded with the new party to sell the nobles and completely ended the feudal imperial dynasty that had lasted for hundreds of years. The reason for all this was that during the war, the imperial royal family toughly plundered too much wealth and materials from the hands of the nobility through such various policies and special wartime laws, and the aristocrats were already dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and regardless of the reasons and consequences of what factors have been affected, in general, the local guards, the decree issued in wartime seems to have been forgotten, not because It was cancelled at the end of the war and can still be implemented in accordance with the laws and regulations of the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
