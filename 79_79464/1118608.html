			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday morning, the entire westerner knew that Du Lin would be involved in the general election two years later, but Du Lin did not disclose which state he would participate in. The governor's campaign, which left a lot of suspense. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the death of the doormen, a large number of grassroots political forces in the west fell into a vacuum. Under the compromise between the New Party and the Old Party, both sides sent a large number of officials to fill the west. The grassroots, but the governor has not changed. Among the governors of the three western states, there is a member of the old party, two members of the new party. There were only two states in the west, but a large middle class wanted to get rid of the impression of being a countryman in a backward area. A referendum was initiated. The two states became three states, and these middle classes were more likely to be closer to the south-central part of the Empire, although they were still Westerners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They claim to be Central or Southern, and they are not willing to admit that they are Westerners, even though they are indeed Westerners and cannot change this fact in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin and Hellsmann believe that the newly established state is not a suitable state of the campaign because there are too many middle classes, and these middle classes are trying to get rid of Their own impressions can initiate a referendum, and their own positions will be more biased towards the old party. The "elite society" proposed by the old party in recent years is very popular among the middle class. The so-called elite society is a kind of alternative class restoration. The idea of ​​pulling the middle class of society into a single elite has made many middle-class people ecstatic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the advocacy of the old party, many middle classes are somewhat dissatisfied with the current social environment. They think that they contribute more to society and the country than others. But they did not enjoy the same treatment. They don't have any difference from ordinary people who can only earn 50 or 60 a month. They need recognition from the whole society. They don't just use the middle class to describe them. They also need respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old party’s idea, the elite of society should enjoy better treatment and more benefits. They account for between 10% and 20% of the country's total population, but they contribute more than 70% of the population to the country. They represent the most important part of a country and should have Not at the bottom of society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a hit with most middle-class families. Many middle-class families are supporting the old party, donating various funds for them, and spontaneously safeguarding the interests of the old party. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Doolin took the lead in the implementation of the household registration system in Otis, the old party has been planning a new household registration system, hierarchical social household registration system, and they also implemented a social social system to promote the level of household registration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general public has some resentment about this, but not everyone is disgusted with the old party’s remarks. There are always some pretentious people who think that they are very It is also able to enter the middle class and become an elite class that is different from ordinary people. There are not many people who hold this kind of thinking. The popularity of education and the emergence of various vocational schools have given the bottom of the society a lot of opportunities, giving them a ladder to a higher level. When these people spent the hardest hours of learning through the efforts of others, and spent their youth on learning, they gained varying degrees of success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this success, besides being reflected in wealth, does not better reflect the difference between yourself and others. For example, a middle class with an income of 2,000 yuan a year dine in a restaurant. The table around him may be the bottom of the society with only a few hundred dollars a year. How does it reflect that he is different from Superman? The head of the party? What they need is privilege, a different treatment, and something completely separate from the underlying society! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Party and the Old Party have essential differences in their concepts. The New Party’s political program and ruling ideas are more inclined to free competition and will not be targeted at certain people. It will not deliberately suppress some people. The opening is a slap in the face. How to develop and how to develop to the extent depends on the individual's ability. This is a very good environment for some people who are truly capable. The society like the law of the jungle, under the increasing competitiveness, screens out a group of unqualified people and precipitates them as the grassroots of society. Some capable people have evolved into The middle and upper levels of society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s not fair to be fair, it’s at least fair, because everyone has a chance, everyone is the same, no one is destined To be successful, no one is doomed to failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old party’s program and management style are different. The old party put the class on a new dress and put it on the stage. Many people are The new clothes are confused and you can't see the things behind the new clothes. The social upgrading system is the set of things that the old party is best at. The original Tener was implementing this system. They emphasize fairness. Everyone is from nothing, and they are crawling up and down. As long as they make corresponding contributions to society, they will inevitably receive corresponding feedback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the old party's concept, everyone has a ladder in front of them. Everyone can continue on the ladder in accordance with the social system, constantly improve their position in society, and have more benefits and privileges. But in fact, these people artificially set a few small levels, not to be discovered. An ordinary person wants to become a middle and high level of society, and in addition to his own efforts, he also needs to get enough personal connections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is no ordinary person, how do you get to know some of the connections that will give you the opportunity to be promoted? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is simple, the benefits are delivered! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin during the period of the city of Tener, there are several people who can really step up the ladder across the threshold, nothing more than the so-called "tycoon". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the people of Codor and Wolfwood, they can find that they are developing in the prescribed environment according to the requirements of the old party, every stage. It will change a form, but the essence will not change. They gain the recognition of the upper class by means of the transfer of benefits, and then give them a key to open the door to promotion, thus gaining the social status. They have become the "sacrifices" of this social system, and at the same time they are vested interests, which is precisely the most recognized way for those who support the old party. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, under the social system operated by the old party, the lower-level society must obey the higher-level society, otherwise there will be no way out, one way to death, so many times Personal ability has no value at the social level. As long as you know the key person, you can make a breakthrough in social hierarchy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old party’s governance philosophy is not too backward for the whole world, and it doesn’t even make people feel that there are too many problems. After all, the empire is from feudal The rule has come out for more than 20 years. There are still many feudal systems in the world. For the citizens who are currently in the same year, they are still in the conflicts and contradictions between the old and the old. The New Party's emphasis on personal ability and the old party's relationship with social development have their own supporters. Even if the royal family has retired for more than 20 years, is there a day when people are nostalgic to rule by the royal family, or are they ruled by the nobility? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The culture received by the main population of society is the biggest distinction between the New Party and the Old Party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young people born after the New Party came to power, most of them do not like the old party’s set of things, but now the middle class in society, the top of society, but The beneficiaries of the old system are more willing to support the idea of ​​maintaining the old party. If the royal family can be restored, they may be the most determined supporters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
