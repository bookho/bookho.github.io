			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mayor Peter heard the name "Du Lin", he suddenly remembered the young man, who did not hesitate to pay for him at the charity party. The young man, the young man who was thrown into jail by him as a chess piece to test others, the young man who seemed to be forced by him to leave his hometown and leave Tyne to go outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of a lot of things, the moment the gunshot sounded in his ear, as if the whole world was quiet. He watched the bullet slammed into the air with a cyclone and decided to shoot at himself. His brain told his body that he had to avoid it because the target of the bullet was his chest, even if he was not taken away by a bullet. My own life, I am afraid it will be difficult to continue to be an official in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body does not seem to listen to him too much, without the slightest reaction, his eyebrows are about to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, he stared blankly at the clothes on his chest and had not had time to wrap the bullets and was pierced by a bullet. He thought that the blood in his body would be sprayed out immediately, but this is not the case. The blood-red hole did not immediately spurt out, even the blood did not flow out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, his body can move, but the strength of the body is quickly leaving him, he can not continue to support his body to continue to stand, A huge force pushed him to the back and fell to the ground, because the fear of breathing was short and short. He should actually thank the young man in front of him because he used a pistol instead of a knife. If it is a knife, he will die very painfully. The air will enter the body to prevent the lungs from expanding. If he does not die because of excessive blood loss, he will also die of suffocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a more painful way to die, at least more painful than he is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man came under the neon light, the faint light could see his face, and the mayor of Peter remembered this person, he was always behind Du Lin That guy, it really is this group of people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha stood with no expression, the cold eyes in his eyes were like watching an animal that was about to be slaughtered. He shook his head. "You shouldn’t Then, for Vivienne."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If something is more unacceptable than being assassinated, then it may be Peter’s current situation, the assassin not only has to Taking away his life, he still has to give him a shame that can never be erased, a shame that all men can't stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out his hand and grabbed the trouser leg of the Buddha. The police whistle had already sounded on the street outside. The police officers who patrolled at night had already called their companions and rushed over here. If you ignore their hesitant speed, they may still play a role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the fingertips of Peter, he was about to touch the trousers of Dufo, and when he wanted to do something in his red face, he raised his feet. Hey, stepped on the hand of Mayor Peter. He took a box of cigarettes out of his pocket and pulled out a point. The fire illumined his face for a short time, and after that moment, it was covered by darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not too late, Mr. Peter, goodbye!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three police cars madly rushing To the intersection, in the telephone booth on the side of the road, the butler of the mayor’s adult just came out. He glanced at the three police cars that turned around the corner and also crashed a garbage bin and silently got into the car. When the gunshots sounded, he knew that something went wrong, whether it was done by Mr. Member or the Governor who did not know when he would go to see the Lord, would not give Peter any chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s better to leave this flower world with Peter. The value of loyalty is not to die blindly, but to live, he told himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the blue light reflected by the last warning light, and directly turned the front of the car toward the mayor’s villa. He needs to bring something. Then leave here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the three police officers were about to approach the alley where the Buddha was located, suddenly there was a loud bang like a thunder, and the head of the first police car slammed The next pressure, then jumped up. Rolling and sliding to the side of the road. The latter two police cars chose the brakes at the same time. The police ran out of the police car and relied on the police car as an obstacle to observe the dark alleys. There is no doubt that the other side has heavy fire weapons, otherwise it is impossible to jump a car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the shot was as if it had disappeared, and it never sounded again. A police officer tried to get close to the alley, and there was a loud noise. The broken stone shot from the broken wall marked a few blood marks on the young policeman’s face. His courage disappeared in a flash. And then retracted back to the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About two minutes, the reinforcements of the police station arrived, and the loud noise seemed to have really disappeared. When the police chief was standing in the lane with a policeman's face, it seemed as if a card could be used to scrape a layer of water on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew the guy with a gunshot on the head of the ground, the real master of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is aware of the seriousness of this issue, and Tyner is going to turn the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a light-car from the back door of the bar and entered the bar. His pistol had been disposed of by him, and he was thrown into the trash can near the entrance of the bar. He went to the bar and ordered a glass of wine while drinking and watching the performances of women who were prone to sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took only three minutes, all the lights in the bar were opened at the same time, the noisy music also came to an abrupt end, a large number of policemen poured in from the door, some The women screamed and wrapped their clothes tightly on their chests. Some men also pulled the zipper on the trousers that they forgot to pull when they went out, and smeared the sticky sweat on their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Police prosecution! Everyone standing in the same place does not move, let the person in charge of the bar come over.", the police chief has already dressed, if anyone pays attention If you look at it, you may find that this guy is wearing a pair of pajama pants, and there is also a pair of slippers on his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was sleeping when he was disturbed. If someone called to tell him that the mayor of Peter was attacked, he could not become so flustered that he even The instruments are not finished and they are out of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the bar rushed in after ten minutes. When he wanted to talk to the bartender in the bar, he was stopped by the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, Mr., no one is allowed to communicate without the permission of the Secretary." The little policeman holds a pistol in his hand and looks at the bar owner. The eyes are a bit bad. As the lowest police officer in the police station, it is not as comfortable as people think, so it is arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich people can’t touch them, the gangs who have big power behind them can’t touch them, even those who have the skills of the family and the bottom, they I can't touch it. They seem to be able to deal with the little gangsters that are not weatherable, and the little gangs that are not even in the sphere of influence. Suddenly there was such an opportunity, which made the little policeman feel the excitement unprecedented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bar owner laughed a few times, carrying a box of cigarettes in his hand and stuffing it into the hands of the little policeman, he blocked the sight of others. I won't let the little police officer feel embarrassed, or hey, "Can you tell me what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little policeman quietly put the cigarette in his pocket and whispered, "The mayor of Peter is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the bar suddenly stood up On the spot, he immediately realized that it was the responsibility of the police chief to pass on. As long as he can be sure that the murderer is in the bar, or that the murderer has appeared in this bar, then he and his bar will become the most suitable scapegoat in the night. Not only can his bar not go on, he may be subject to other involvement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately went to the bureau, but the director did not want to see him now. See, things will become more troublesome. If you don't see it, you can pick yourself up. Why do you want to talk to this guy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new party member can put a position in the old party’s city of Tener and fight for the old party for more than a year. He is not destined to be a Ordinary character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every customer must register their identity and accept the search. They are very easy to line up and walk to the door of the bar to accept the police. His inspection. Every pocket in his body has been touched more than once. After confirming that he is harmless, let him register his personal information and allow him to leave. Just a minute after the departure of Dufo, suddenly someone screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Police, there is a person who lost a dagger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woman's exclamation The sound suddenly attracted several policemen to the past. A young man stood with his hands on his face and stood on the wall, his legs began to tremble. He is one of the young people who just grabbed two hundred pieces from Peter. He didn't know what happened, he just didn't want to get into trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the police dumped all the rubbish in the trash, they saw a pistol and all the muzzles were aimed at the young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Buddha was already on the bus, and Kina grinned and started the car and headed for the city. "Is it still going well?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha nodded. "What is in your box? Can you shoot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He heard the two gunshots and saw the cracks on the wall as he walked out of the bar door. It was definitely not caused by ordinary rifles. As young people living in the Guar district, they have been exposed to veterans who have come back from the battlefield. Listening to them telling stories may be one of the few fun things for children. In the instillation of these stories, most children's understanding of weapons and weapons lethality far exceeds people's estimates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
