			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before you saw Mr. Amper, I heard a lot of things about you, such as rumors like Detectives, but I didn't expect Ann. Mr. Pu, your courage is so small.", a little weird tone in the graveyard in the middle of the night gives a feeling of hair in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp took a sip of cigarettes and calmed down the heartbeat that was suddenly scared by this guy. He waited for a while before he said, "I It’s not important to be a person. You said that you know the truth behind Juan’s suicide. I came here for this. I believe that you are here to wait for me. So let’s not waste each other’s time. , say something we are all interested in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man has not moved, just sit on the back of the tombstone, just as the tombstone blocks the moonlight, will him Gathering in the dark, so Amp did not find this guy the first time. At this point, Amp's eyes have adapted to the darkness, and it is possible to distinguish in the dark that this is a guy with a soft-edge adventure cap. The cap is very low. As for what clothes he wears, Amper can't see clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man screamed for a moment, "Okay, let me point to something we are interested in. Juan is thrown away after being stunned." How can the old thing dare to commit suicide? If he has such courage, why not try to kill Du Lin and commit suicide? Maybe he will kill Du Lin without killing him!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp notes that this guy’s sentence uses “old things” to describe Juan, which means that there must be a special relationship between this person and Juan, whether it is an enemy or a friend. . Judging from the hateful tone behind him, this person not only has a relationship with Juan, but also has a relationship with Du Lin, and is likely to have a contradiction with Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp snorted. "Do you know who dropped him? Say something useful, you told me that I have already I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know?", the guy in the shadow was horrified for a moment, then his voice was awkward, "You lie, you It is impossible to know that no one saw the guy at the time, except me!", Amp did not speak, continued to look at him, the talent said: "If you don't believe it, then it is true, but this is the truth."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp played a ash, making the highlights of the cigarettes brighter. He took a sip of smoke and spit out a thick column of smoke. "This...sir, you Proactively explain this to me, what do you want to do, or what do you want from me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp always believes that motivation is the most important thing. In fact, in many trials, there is often evidence to support the prosecutor’s complaint, but in the end, the suspect’s innocence will occur, leading to this phenomenon. Is the question of motivation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been a very special case in which a serial killer called the Ranger Killer appeared. His goal is to have no homes on the street. Returned to the tramp. This killer often chooses to commit crimes late at night, has no specific location, has no specific choices, and is highly random. His modus operandi is not complicated, using stones that can be seen everywhere on the roadside, facing the sleeping tramp heads a few times, and then disappearing quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final case locked a criminal suspect, a local well-known rich. The police found evidence of blood in his car and in a remote grove, as well as testimony from two witnesses, but in the end he was acquitted by the lawyer's lobbying. The reason is simple, the motivation is not enough. One is a well-known decent person, and the other is a poor homeless tramp. There is no connection between the two sides. There are no contradictions and conflicts of interest. The rich have no reason to kill these tramps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the blood, because it is impossible to identify where the blood came from, the jury thought that the rich had nothing to do with the case and was released in court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Motivation is a very important thing. It can also be seen as a purpose. Everyone has motivation and purpose in everything. Hungry, so eat, thirsty, so drink water, these are motivations, then what is the motivation of this guy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tramp was silent for a moment before he whispered: "I am the one who pushed Juan down the roof..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Amp heard this sentence, he didn’t know that even the cigarette between his fingers slipped, but he knew another thing, and the breach found it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the addition of this special "witness", some doubts in Amp's view are solved, although there are still some unclear things. As for the witness who is willing to appear in court, why should he report Du Lin and have a relationship with Amp. The arrival of Amp made Du Lin feel the pressure. Ampna's 100% detection rate is a bit scary, so in order to avoid problems, Du Lin intends to get rid of him, he first discovered the situation and escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irian is the old nest of Doolin, where both the police and the city hall are talking to Du Lin. The guy who claimed to be Du Lin’s men told the truth, and it was unrealistic to want to catch Du Lin through local official assistance. Even Du Lin’s people were in the police station. He also gave an example for this, that is, the gunman in the murder of Abien was inexplicably hoisted in the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter has been known through the intelligence gathering of detectives, and it also proves that this guy may indeed be the murderer behind the suicide case in Juan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when the two exchanged information, Amp suddenly heard some noisy footsteps from the other side, the guy hiding in the shadows. Turn around and run. If during the day, the running sound may not be noticeable, but in this silent night, the sounds of those running on the dead branches are a bit harsh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible to hear someone shouting "on the side", a few oil lamps flickered in the distance, a group of people chased over. Amp snorted and quickly chased the murderer and ran over. He didn't run a few steps. The group might have used Amp as their "target" and actually shot directly. The bullet landed near Amp, and he cursed and used the tombstone to avoid shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshots tore the silence of the night, and passed very far. In less than a minute, the headlights of the two cars appeared at the gate of the cemetery, those The people who chased them stepped in and began to flee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the police investigation agent came down from the car, Amp just passed him by, and he leaned against the group and turned to the opposite side. The people who ran in the direction, ran and shouted: "Catch them, be careful, I will chase witnesses." He ran hard and ran and shouted: "They are gone, you are safe now... Damn, only we can protect you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps his shouting has worked, and the guy who is running has slowed down, "Du Lin is here. The city wants to kill, no one can stop him, you can't rely on it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp also slowed down and showed his sincerity, "As long as you are willing Providing evidence and giving evidence in court, we can guarantee your safety, and we will immediately transfer you to the Imperial Capital. If Du Lin has more money, there is no way to interfere with the Emperor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man finally stopped, he gasped slightly, his eyes were in the moonlight Exudes luster irradiation horrified, "When can I go to Royal Park?" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Anpu bit his teeth, "Tomorrow!", by adding another sentence, "Early morning!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin heard the scene at this time The news, he laughed for a while, then shook his head and sat in an inconspicuous car and left the fifth district, the fish hooked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can't blame An Pu stupid, anyone staying in a dead end for a long time, once found a way to rush out, will be desperate to seize this method. From the above, the deadline for Amp is only nine days. After nine days, Doolin will completely get rid of the impact of this case on him. How can Amp, who hates hatred, give up this possible clue? Moreover, there are always a full set of play, and two of those who arrested the "witnesses" were arrested. These are the big packages that Kevin sent to Amp, and the guy must be very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are indeed true. One night, there was a major breakthrough in the case, which made the entire investigation team very uplifting. They will pass the details to the Emperor and arrange for people to protect the three "witnesses" and ask for the tickets for the early morning of the next day. They will be sent directly to the Imperial Capital. After waiting for them to open their mouths, the testimony called "Brunney" and the evidence he provided were enough for Du Lin to plant in this case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captured Doolin, the rest is to open Doolin's mouth, two big cases together, definitely let the guy on the gallows! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are still some doubts in this matter that have not been solved, and this is a bit... smooth, but Amp believes that the Emperor will definitely cooperate with him. Work here, get the most true testimony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is moving in the right direction, and Amp is finally able to sleep well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, under heavy protection, they sent three witnesses to the ship to Emperor, and at the same time they found some hidden. Staring at them nearby, Amp's mind was slightly fixed. After the ship went far, he immediately took the person to the town hall and asked the mayor to communicate with the navy and give them strong protection. If the mayor does not cooperate, he may ask the emperor to let the high-level party or military high-level officials personally order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, this is a "century case" involving 70 million in cash. The top level is also very concerned about this. There is too much money. Many people are tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
