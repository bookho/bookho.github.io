			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenagers stared at Doolin with their eyes wide open, they needed something to convince them, and they were eager to win. They all know that if they lose, some of them may die. Others have to leave the city of Tener, wandering outside, and may not be able to return for the rest of their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not underestimate the memory of these "big men" and let them hate things, they can remember for a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if they win, they will change the situation of the whole city of Tener, they will become "decent people" in the eyes of the people, they will also speak The family plays a decisive role. They will also change their family, change the family's living environment, let younger brothers and sisters put on new clothes, and send them to school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that they can change their own destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether winning or losing, this is a gambling war, so they need to hear something that will cheer them up and get out before the war breaks out. Instead of sitting in a place and waiting to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at a pair of eager eyes, Du Lin smiled very easily and said in a very relaxed tone: "Hey, we all know that he is Wood. I also know that his nickname is 'coward'. We know that he lives in No. 93 Maixiang Garden, we also know that his office is on the third floor of No. 93 Binhai Avenue. We know that he has a lot of people, Robben, Kyrgyzstan. Whatever it is, we find almost all the details of him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his voice and the voice became slightly higher. "But, does he know what we are? He I don't know if my name is Doolin. I don't know that this monster-like guy is called Graf. I don't know that this beautiful guy who is better than the girl is called Buddha. He doesn't know you, don't know all of you, don't know all about it. Everything about us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So why can he beat us? Should he come to the air?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence makes many young people laugh, come and have It may be a bullet or a bullet. This is a bit of an unhealthy pun, but it is very useful for this group of half-sized teenagers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also laughed. "The second point is that he is a famous tycoon of the upper class. He has countless money, there are countless people who are willing to help him, and many people are willing to sell for him. I said Do you think that you are a little scared? Do you think he is amazing?" Looking at the big guy, Du Lin shrugged his shoulders. "Wrong, big mistakes. In fact, he has nothing, he is willing to help him. People are not all of them, and those who are willing to sell for him will not be really desperate if they do not have enough benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So he saves money What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This society tells us that if a person has only money, but he does not have the power to guard the money, he can only rely on others’ Strength, then he will lose, and will lose very badly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still a third point!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at every young face, "He is too rich, has people Seeking good, and we have nothing! It is because we have nothing, so what are we afraid of? If we lose, we will take away all our lives, or let us leave nothing and nothing belongs to us. The place. We didn't have it, and naturally we don't need to be afraid of losing anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he is different, he has too many things to worry about. There are too many things, so that in the face of every choice, he has to think about each choice of his own, will not have some impact on some of his own things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I dare to go to the Maixiang Garden 93 with a pistol and point to his head to pull the trigger, but he dares? He wants to think, hesitate, then spend money to send a person here. Come find us, fight us after we find us, and beware of other people and things, even those he finds are not necessarily willing to work hard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"We can't afford it, Once or twice, more times, more times, we can all lose. But he can't afford to lose, as long as he loses, he will take the exam to consider self-protection, and then lose all."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I am standing here, telling everyone loudly, we will win!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, the Buddha pulled Du Lin to the side. He turned his back to the outside and refused to let people approach. He whispered: "I heard that Wood has many pistols in hand, and at least there are several. "There is a trace of anxiety on his face. The gun is a great deterrent in the war between the gangs. It is far from being solved by many people. The other side has only three or five gunmen and dares to shoot." It is highly likely to destroy the morale and fighting spirit that Du Lin is erecting today.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question Du Lin actually thought about it last night. He took a picture of the Buddha's shoulder and appreciated him very much. The people who can still use their brains at this critical moment are really few and very important. Du Lin glanced at the teenager standing around and said with a smile: "I have already considered it. Although we don't have a gun, we have bows and arrows!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to some developed cities, the Yaoxing Empire is basically a rural area with a sparsely populated landscape. In such an environment where there is no human intervention in nature, wild animals have been flooded. Nor was anyone considering the targeted opening of guns to farmers and ranchers living in the suburbs, but this idea was later rejected. Instead, the bows and arrows are distributed and the bows are replaced by bows and arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was done to prevent the conquered people from getting enough guns and ammunition to trigger a civil war. There are a number of extreme organizations in the conquered races. If they are armed, they may indeed rebel. Of course, the facts are not as terrible as the big men imagined. The law is like a riddled door. Those organizations have long been armed enough but have not seen them uprising or doing anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, the ultimate goal that people pursue is nothing more than power and wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these have nothing to do with the current Doolin. The popularity of bows and arrows instead of guns has made many farmers in the country have a good archery. Almost every household will bow. In the city, there are also several bow and arrow clubs. Of course, they will never open to ordinary farmers. In the eyes of many high-ranking people, the farmer is not the archery, but the hunting technique. How to use bows and arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only when they use expensive and fancy bows to shoot expensive arrows can they be called archery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the bow and arrow are far better than the pistol in the battle. The range of the pistol is only 20 meters, but the effective range of the bow and arrow can exceed 50 meters, some powerful hunters Can even shoot through the target of 80 meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using bows and arrows in frontal battles is definitely more effective than using a pistol and is a miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Du Lin has already considered, and Buddha is not talking. His strength lies in his courage, his black hand, his certain mind, but he feels a little worse than Du Lin. Plus he is only a team leader now, so he believes that Doolin can arrange everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine in the bar is still available, but the people responsible for the escort have become more and more, and there have been no incidents for several days. This has made some people in Tener’s city who know the details feel overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shouldn’t it be a war? Why are there no movements on both sides? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, they did not know that the two sides have not seen each other until now, so what about fighting? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This quiet and repressed atmosphere was finally broken on the ninth day after the incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf rushed into Doolin’s office like a buffalo that had been injured, and Doolin looked at him in the boss’s chair, without a trace in his eyes. fluctuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grafton felt uncomfortable in his body. He subconsciously waved his arm and walked back and forth a few steps, punching the newly renovated wall in the office. The wooden wall panels gave him a hole, and with his simple punch, five dollars would be gone. New wall panels, new wallpapers, and hired workers, when the money is concentrated on a wall panel, is the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to vent your energy, I suggest you go to the third floor. I hang a few sandbags on the third floor, cowhide, if you I might be happy if I can break it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After breaking the wallboard, the destructive achievements eased Graf’s anxiety, he sat down in the chair On the top, let the chair emit a sound that is hard to hear when the wood rubs. He held his head in his hands and looked helpless. "My mother and my brother were taken away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grav has a mother, but Doolin For the first time, I knew that he actually had a younger brother. When he was recruiting a few years ago, Graf ran to the wild to hide, and he was not forced to recruit troops. These are all he said. But he never said that he had a younger brother. This made Du Lin feel a little unpleasant. He hid it very well. "Who took it, Wood?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can anyone be there be that bastard?", Graf screamed as he looked up, and when he went back to send the money, he knew it from the neighbor's mouth. He felt like he was going crazy. Now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s his only relatives, especially his younger brother, who lived with him. The money he earned in the past few years left a part of himself. I took it to his brother to go to school. For outsiders, he never said that he has a younger brother, because his brother is a "good boy", a good student, currently attending college in the capital. During this time, Graf sent a lot of money to his brother, let his brother from surprise to fear, afraid that Graf did something illegal, and then secretly took time off to return to Turner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
