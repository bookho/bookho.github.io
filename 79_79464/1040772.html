			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the official voice of the empire, there have been some reversals in some things, most notably the problems of those slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabinet listened to Otto’s proposal and finally decided to take Duolin’s shameless approach to reverse the empire’s disadvantages in international public opinion. Although some big people feel that it is a bit shameful to do so, with the full force of Maggs and the Foreign Minister, the entire cabinet has passed this black-and-white approach. Soon a large number of reporters poured into the west, where they saw a clean and tidy camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all escapers are willing to continue to mine in the damn mines, and more refugees will receive the subsidies from the mine owners and temporarily obey the state government. Arranged to camp on the outskirts of some cities for more specific placement. For those who are willing to cooperate, they are arranged around a capital like Villier. They are better in spirit and very clean. The most important thing is that they will speak beautiful words and are suitable for exposing some. Need to be revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people have evolved from slaves to escapers and have evolved into such noble occupations as actors, facing many reporters and flashing spotlights, they are in tears. The whole society is accused of their original country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Someone asked me if I want to go back to my home country when I suffered some persecution. My answer is no. I would rather be here. I die on the land and I don’t want to go back to my country, because I can die anywhere, anytime, and the opposite is that I can fill my stomach here. I don’t need to think about how I passed the way I used to. To get a food that can sustain my life, and don't need to whisper and plead for a bite of food at the feet of those tyranians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the Yaoxing Empire, even if They treated me in the most cruel way that people said, and I still feel more happy here than in my home country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today, I regained my freedom. I thank the cabinet of the Yaoxing Empire, thank Mr. Doolin, thank Mr. Amon, and thank you for these friendly reporters. If someone asks me if I want to go back now, I will tell him to kill me. I won’t go. Live in You may not be able to imagine the tyranny of this tyrannical country in this happy country, perhaps because your clothes color makes the tyranny feel that it does not match the surrounding environment, he will command the soldiers under his command to shoot you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may also be because the voice of your voice is too loud, let him feel that you do not respect him, he will let people cut off your tongue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In my home country, people face a lot of danger every day, because you don't know when the tyranny will return to heaven for what reason. But here, in this rich and civilized country. I finally felt the humanistic care and warmth that human beings should feel in the society. Hey, this is our current food, in addition to a piece of beef, there are some plant leaves and meal packs, such food is in my Only the big guys in the country can eat..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a slave to the tyranny who lived under the tyranny’s rule and felt like an empire. Not far from being a happy man from a civilian under the tyranny, another refugee is talking to reporters about his feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never seen such a peaceful country, I am not in a satirical way to reflect what I have experienced, I am true. I have never seen such a peaceful country. In my hometown, many people may only have 16 years in their lives. I doubt that every boy, as long as he is sixteen years old, will be taken to the battlefield to fight for a fight. The war of disreputation. Until now we don’t know why there is war, why the war never ended, we don’t even know who is playing, who is hitting us!”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sometimes there are some problems in the war on the front line, such as the loss of the line of defense. At this time, children aged 14 and 15 have to go to the battlefield, and a group of people of their age. The children fought until one of them retired. In this environment, only three or five out of a hundred men can live to adulthood, and most of these people are children of aristocratic family."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "Here, I want to thank those smuggling organizations that buy and sell people, they let me out of the bitter sea. I am already twenty-two years old, they let me live for six more years. What have I suffered in these six years? I don't mind if I live well enough. Because I have a grateful heart, at least I am still alive, I can stand here and tell you something you don't know."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Abuse? No, no, it’s not abuse for me. A kind-hearted mine owner took the money and took me, and gave me a meal that would allow me to have a meal. Work, although it is very hard, but I am very happy. Mining makes me happy, and living makes me happy. I don't hate anyone, but I thank them.", said the young man took off his shirt and showed his strength. The body, he patted his arm. "You have not experienced the endless war, it is difficult to feel my satisfaction with life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Journalists from each empire, one by one from the international journalist, looked like a fool and looked at these refugees who had been out of the mine for only a week and had been called slaves. The purpose of these reporters here is to want to explode a big news. By interviewing these slaves who have been abused and unfairly treated, they declare the cruelty of the Yaoxing Empire to the whole world, telling everyone that this is a moral sorrow, and the humanity collapses. country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But... why is it different from the imagination? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The journalists who belong to the empire are very indifferent. Anyway, they are political missions. In this series of reports, the newspapers are very clear about how to correct them. Your own location. This is not a good time to get attention from the public. If anyone breaks the current inexplicable situation, there is a good chance that there will be a terrible end. Not only the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the cabinet said that even some gang members told the newspaper operators to manage the reporter’s pen and manage the reports of each day, otherwise they would die on the list of employees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Doolin is coming..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one who knows who is shouting in the distance, More and more people are shouting, reporters, refugees, and they are all heading in the direction of Du Lin. As the cabinet agreed to try the "Ordinary Resettlement Act" in the west, Du Lin became a one-man singer. He personally called Magus and said that it took about twenty minutes to get the matter in his hands. For Magus, some people are willing to pay to help the cabinet to solve this problem as soon as possible. Even if it fails, it does not need any official responsibility, and can earn great reputation from it. So why not let Du Lin try one? test? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Du Lin, these people will become important pawns for him to firmly control the West, even if there is some effort, it is worth it. More importantly, he must show his use of the empire and the cabinet, so that the people of Magus and the cabinet will not come to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin walked in the protection of several guards in a neat and clean dress. He constantly waved and nodded to the people around him, no matter whether these refugees really wanted to To say the lines that know the script at a glance, at least their recognition and gratitude to Du Lin is sincere. If there is no Doolin operation, maybe they are still mining in the mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reporters rushed over and shouted the questions they wanted to ask, and wanted to find some different news points from Doolin. Du Lin did not pay attention to these people. Now there are not only journalists from the empire, but also journalists from other countries in the world. Any words that may have a positional nature may damage the fragile dignity of some countries, so he does not publish Any comments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
