			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shiny scorpion under the moonlight reveals the true meaning of the slag of the soil. Xien is very serious. He really wants to help Du Lin. I spent the difficult time, but he even wanted to uncover the corruption of the old party in the city of Tener. He wants to go back to the center of the empire and wants to re-name people to himself. He is definitely not a deserter. But all of this has a premise. He must have the ability to get the results, and be able to impress the new party’s big man with authority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss of Xien’s boss kicked him to the city of Tener for the sake of “covering”, but he was not willing, he wanted to go back and wanted Participated in the investigation of the Empire's largest conspiracy ever. Before he had no clue, drunk every day, in addition to careful precautions, in fact, in the bar or some entertainment venues, the streets and alleys to collect information on the city of Tener. As the intelligence collection became more sophisticated, the more he felt, the city of Turner was a place where he could go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city is rotten! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the rule of the old party, everything was related to money, and the transaction between a merchant and a politician was so brilliant. Those big-faced big people don't care about the life problems of the residents in the city. They only care about how much money they collected this month. How many of them are their own and how much need to be turned over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, turn in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tnel City as the chassis of the old party control, the main task is to "make blood" for the higher level of the old party, a large number of black gold will pass through various channels Inflows into the state's old party campaign office, some will serve as the "election funds" for the old party to compete for the governor and more seats in the state of Cannes, and more will continue to be turned over to the "empire lion club" where the old party is located in the capital. . The club behind the club is the giants of the old party. In this way, they distribute black gold to various places for the blocking of the new party. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the transfusion vascular channel in the city of Ternell is broken, destroying the "hematopoietic" function of the city of Tyrell, it will cause a domino phenomenon. Angry people and the media will report on the corruption of Cannes, and the new party will also take the opportunity to attack the old party’s power in Cannes. Once the old party loses the blood input of Cannes, all plans need to be carried out. Adjustments, even some plans have to be suspended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Xiuen became famous. As a pioneer of anti-corruption, he will be recognized by the leaders of the New Party and return to the core of the empire to continue investigations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Xiu En was so excited that he slammed his fist, and the only thing missing is Du Lin nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to open the old party’s cover in the city of Tener, a person can’t do it, someone must cooperate with him, and now the best ally is Du Lin in front of me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First he has money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be very realistic and vulgar. As a senior agent of the great Imperial Guards Investigation Bureau, it seems that money is a criminal in addition to criminals. In addition to sin, it should not appear in the heart of the grace. But the problem is that the word has appeared and it has been placed in a very important place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money is very important, in this era you can look ugly, you can have nothing, but you must have money. As long as there is money, there is nothing you can't get. Whether it is status or prestige, even the sacred love of philosophers and fanatical literary lovers can be easily bought, but the price is high and low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy some important informants need money, buy some very special equipment and need money, even if you have to eat and sleep, how important is money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that Du Lin has someone at hand and is a reliable person. Compared with other gangs, the purity of the fellowship has always been something that Xiuen has seen. The Guar people of the fellowship may have a rich dream, but on the road of pursuing their dreams, they strictly abide by it. The guar's code of conduct, few people will cross the line. Even today, Prando’s rumor spreads about Jon’s news, and no guar is standing out for money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are trustworthy, and this is also the most important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are money, some people, then the rest is left to be desperate. Xiuen has a desperate reason, because he wants to return to the center and re-stand in the imperial capital, and to the people he is not a deserter. Dooling also had a desperate reason, because once he was captured, he, fellow villagers and Guars would be devastated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have the same goal, have a similar situation, then why not close together and scream at this decaying world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s eyes are constantly changing. He pondered for a moment and said: “With the energy of the mayor’s adult, he will know Joe in a week. Who is it, if you want to work with me, then we must try to stay through this first week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually a long time With the intention, he snorted like a smile, and then his face changed suddenly. Dooling's eyes rolled back one after another, and the pistol was already in his hand, aiming at the dark night that had been seen before. The next second, a snoring came, Du Lin's eyes were pumped, and Xien smiled and spit. The ghost knew how much he had drunk this evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spoken for a while, the two changed to a bench and sat down again. Xiuen rubbed his lips and smiled and said: "Prando has been I don't trust me. From the day I came, he has been watching me. Only after I have been unconscious, they will relax and monitor me.", Xien sighed and came from After the life of Tener, the life is really very tired. Every day, he is acting, and he is pretending to be dead every day. Only then will Prando not doubt him, and he will not be wary of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that is fortunate is that in places where drunks gather, the news is often the fastest and most widely spread place, and he is easily drunk from other sources. In the mouth of the drunkard, and some women who have skills in the flesh business, they heard the news he wanted to know. Of course, these messages are limited to the underlying news, and high-level news will be obtained from the State Bureau of Investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few years, Prando has not relaxed his surveillance until now, which makes him more cautious about Prando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sly, very cautious guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the narrative of the grace, Du Lin nodded and understood. He knew that Prando was embarrassed, but he did not expect him to be cautious to think that he was paranoid or It is the same as a mentally ill person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are you going to help me through this difficult time?", Du Lin handed the handkerchief to Shane was thrown on the floor by Du Lin, above The vomit made him unable to put it back, slightly frowning and talking about this topic, and this topic is also the key to cooperation between the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiu En smiled in disapproval and asked: "What do you think is the most precious thing for people like Peter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dooling gave an answer without much thought. "Is life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shen is shaking his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the power and status in my own hands?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schoen shakes his head again, he lifts Starting to prevent Du Lin from continuing to speculate, the scorpion glittered. "For these politicians, political life is their most important thing, above their attention to their lives and their family. You know." The Delano Act?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Delano Act is a binding act against the nobility proposed by Prime Minister Delano, who has been dead for more than three hundred years. This bill restricts the power of the nobility and allows the imperial power to expand further. Until today, the Delano Act is still playing an unparalleled binding. To put it simply, Delano believes that “all groups that aim at selfish political interests are essentially illegal and violate the rights of the imperial royal family and all just aristocrats.” After the passage of this bill, all politics Sex groups must register and explain their political aspirations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the reasons why the imperial parliament, the predecessor of the upper and lower parliament, was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for politicians, they can die, their powers and rights can be violated, but their political life must not have any faults . Because even if they die, their political life will not be completely completed by the death of individual species. Political life will continue with their contributions in politics, let them continue to "live"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really easy to avoid Peter’s attention for a while, there are two ways to do it.”, Schwen said when two methods were used. Lin couldn't help but laugh. He is now a lot easier. Secondly, because of his example, he also likes to use two examples to prove each other. This makes him feel that he and Xien should be all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiuen was inexplicably laughed at by him, and glanced at him and continued: "One, Peter and Vivian are married and there are no children now, Peter is outside. There are four lovers in the house, and there are no children at the moment. This shows that Peter has a problem with his body. I asked some friends to check it. Peter had an accident when he was in the gendarmerie. When they suppressed the riots, they were defamed. He kicked the lower body and let him faint. It may be that he lost his ability to give birth after that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
