			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of Mr. Bain, Alisa finally reluctantly agreed to Mr. Bain’s request, after changing her clothes, pushing the stroller and Bain Mr. walked together in the park in the community. It is a high-end residential area in Shangcheng District. It is a middle class and a relatively successful government official. The environment is very beautiful and the security protection measures of the community are also in place. Many government officials live in this community. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the winding path of the park, strolling between the trees, the spring and summer alternately swayed in the gentleness of the wind, making people feel relaxed and happy. The whole heart is wide open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t blame your mother, many times she is not malicious, but some mentality has become a habit, and don’t blame your brother. I didn't teach him well!" Mr. Bain was apologetic. Mrs. Bain and his son were always stimulating Alisa, and thought that Alisa was a shame to the Bain family and let them lose face. Mr. Bain also has a very headache. He has already warned the two people several times. Now they don’t say anything, but they are obviously cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very bad, the family should have been happy together, but it has become a luxury. He has also recently begun to reflect on his own experiences over the years. He feels that the problem is still on his own. His overly heavy work has neglected the discipline of family members. He has a great responsibility and must Lisa apologized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I always wanted to say this, but you know..." Mr. Bain smiled. "Sometimes this sentence is very difficult to say... ...", Mr. Bain did not do enough for family discipline, otherwise there would not be so many things. Now he only hopes that the family can get along with each other and peace of mind. After he becomes the mayor, everything will change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that he has a wife and a child. When he becomes the mayor, they will rely on him to rely on him, and he will only listen to him. This is his only one. A good way to think of it. As for talking about, it is not very useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa also sighed, since the day she saw Du Lin, her life, her family has begun to undergo tremendous changes, very It is difficult to say regret or not regret, after all, this is her chosen life, her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, father." Alisa smiled. "When I get better, I will move out after a while, so you won't be bothered again.", Alisa's face flashes. After a sorrow, but soon replaced by strong. Her life has new hopes. She only wants to raise her children. This has become a magical thought in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bain’s footsteps stopped at the spot and looked at Alisa’s back without some knowledge. The daughter had to move out because the mother And the younger brother was squinting at her, and Mr. Bain felt that he should say something, but he could not say anything. He took another step to keep up with Alisa, and both of them closed their mouths and did not speak. Deep down, Mr. Bain has been blaming himself for being too weak in resolving family relationships, which has led to the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning home, Alisa took her child upstairs, his wife came back from the outside, was cooking, and the son sat in the living room to see the latest one. Period of tape. They all greeted Mr. Bain, but they did not seem to see Alisa. For these two people, Alisa is their shame. Whenever someone mentions the "good things" that Alisa does, their faces will be ugly and they will be laughed at, so it is inevitable to put this emotion in their hearts and take them home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bain can only helplessly sigh in the face of such a family, he went back to the study and began to review the morning documents, silently waiting for meal time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorbell suddenly rang when the family sat together but didn’t have a family atmosphere, which made the members at the table stop. The action looked at the direction of the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third time the doorbell rang, Mrs. Bain finally stood up and walked to the gate. When she opened the door, she accidentally looked at two very handsome young people outside the door. Through the bodies of the two men, she saw four luxury cars parked outside the lawn, which made Mrs. Bain's face a little more smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be a gift, she thinks so. Since Mr. Bain has become a director, there have been a lot more people giving gifts, which makes her very satisfied. She likes to socialize with these people, and then reluctantly put away the gifts from the other party in desperation, at that moment she feels that she has received unprecedented respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Mrs. Bain raised her wrist very restrained at this time, and asked with some confusion, "Do you have anything?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man in the black dress in front of him took off his hat. "Good afternoon, madam, I am looking for Ms. Alisa."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ali Sasha?”, Mrs. Bain’s face gradually cooled down. She began to pick up the two young people who were very pleasing to the eye. “Who are you, what are you looking for in Alisa?”, in the heart of Mrs. Bain’s In a flash, Alisa’s unmarried pregnancies and children’s births were arranged on this young man. She was so handsome and had some money. It’s not that he lied to Alisa. “Alisa now Uncomfortable, come back next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under what Du Lin answered, Mrs. Bain will close the door, just when the door is about to close. Suddenly the door was pushed open. The sudden strength outside the door made Mrs. Bain smashed and almost fell. She was a little shy and stepped back, rubbing her wrists and watching Du Lin, who was pushing the door with vigilance. Also a little timid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bain immediately stood up and walked toward the door, and even the only boy in the house stood up, only Alisa, sitting silly At the edge of the table, holding the child looking at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sir, it’s very rude to do this. If you can’t give me an explanation, I will call the police." Mr. Bain walked to Bay Between Mrs. En and Du Lin, she blocked his wife and children. Although Mr. Bain is a bit weak in dealing with family relationships, he is very tough in protecting his family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must be Mr. Bain?", Du Lin face laughed like a spring breeze, took the initiative to reach out, and Bain who had not reacted yet. Mr. shook his hand. "I am Du Lin. I specially came to see Alisa and my daughter this time, hoping that I didn't bother you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face Du Lin’s succinct statement that Mr. Bain’s brain has turned a little bit, but the opposite is that his wife reacted very quickly, and stood alone next to Mr. Bain’s. “It’s your jerk.” My daughter is unmarried first, pregnant, child, roll, get out, I don't want to see you!", she said she was going to do it, but when she touched the eyes of Doolin, the action paused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said with a smile, "Ms. Please manage your mouth. If you don't manage well, I don't mind helping you!" After he finished, he nodded and looked at Mr. Bain. In the communication with Alisa, he learned that Mr. Bain is a good person, a little bad guy but also has his own insistence. In short, a good father is right, so he is more willing to communicate with Mr. Bain. Mr. Bain, can I go in?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
