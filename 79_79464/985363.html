			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver of Mr. Puxi did not wait until Mr. Puxi returned after he had smoked a cigarette. He hesitated and walked to the side of the alley and glanced at it. I licked my head. It seems that Mr. Puxi did drink too much, and he was drunk in this remote alley. The driver took off his jacket. This jacket was given to him by Mr. Puxi. It is of course the brand of Mr. Puxi’s own company, worth 180 yuan. It is already a good dress. He can’t bear it. Smudged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shivered in his shirt and walked to Mr. Puxi, shouting twice, Mr. Puxi did not agree, it should be sleeping too dead. He passed under his arm from Mr. Puxi, hugged him up and moved to the back seat of the car. Just as he sat in the cab and took out the rag that was used to clean the car and prepared to wipe the vomits on his hands, his eyes condensed and then screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the streetlight, both hands are full of red, it is not vomit, it is blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald also drank a lot of wine at night, the more you are at this cusp, the more you should unite some people on your side, it’s really necessary to win When they are negative, these people can always help him to do something. In particular, the Speakers and Members of the Chamber of Commerce, their members are all over the empire, and have a good relationship with many politicians and celebrities. If they can say that they are fully helping themselves and supporting themselves, no matter how Du Lin discards him, he can easily face and overcome those rumors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back home lying in bed, my mind is chaotic, Du Lin’s offensive came suddenly, and fiercely, the side of the public opinion made him feel that he was targeted by malicious It is. He asked himself and did not do anything that would harm Dulin's interests, but Du Lin still shot him. The calmness he showed was far less flustered, helpless, and fearful than his inner heart. But what about the strong man who even the mayor dared to kill, what if Dolin came again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to soften to Du Lin, but now is not the time. If he bows his head at this time, then his mayor is really a beggar, no point. self. So he had to wait for this thing to pass, and then bow down slightly with the winner's gesture, that is the opportunity to sit down with Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alcohol and irritated inner heart made him a little dizzy, just as he was about to fall asleep, the phone’s harsh ringing sound suddenly sounded, and he was shocked by the fierceness from the bed. Sit down and look at the phone on the bed in the dark room. During non-working hours, and at such an hour, few people call a mayor because of unimportant things. This is a courtesy and a courtesy. He was a little scared. I don't know if it was because of the alcohol and more, or because the room was too hot. I could see some sweat on my forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within five seconds of reaching up and connecting the phone, the whole person stiffened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puxi is dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must be the hand of Doolin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald didn’t want to put on his clothes and go out of the house immediately. Now the only thing he can do is to find the murderer and the murderer. Then he used capital punishment to show his attitude. If Doolin didn't want his left-wing power to be uprooted, he would better sit at the table and talk to himself calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is this happening? Did you find the murderer?" As soon as he entered the regional police station, Donald began to get angry. He just watched the body of Puxi and passed the forensic doctor. After finishing, he told Donald that he was shot at a close distance. The calmness of Puxi lying on the cold morgue bed is like laughing at his mayor. Even an important friend can't protect the mayor, a mayor who can't manage the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And!", Donald walked up to Hite, the finger poked twice in his chest, "Why is the case happening now, you still stand Here? Shouldn't you go find me the murderer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hite with a smile, but how to look at this smile, let Donald be very Unhappy, "Mr. Mayor, I am the director of the regional police station. I am not the inspector of the police chief below. What I need to do is to dispatch police resources in the police station. I don’t go to the front line to do something that I don’t need. Work!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald was suddenly mad at him, and he hated Du Lin more and more, and even more and more people hated Du Lin, regardless of It is his promoted Secretary-General Scott, or the regional police chief, he is very annoying. He nodded. "Good. Since you think this is not your job, hand over your badge and gun, you are fired! You can do what you want, right now!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hite looked at Donald, Donald was not willing to show off, the two stalemate for about ten or twenty seconds, Hite took off his chest The badges and documents were hung, and the guns were taken out and placed on the reception desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is your power, Mr. Mayor, I obey your orders!", Hite finally glanced at him and turned away from the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hite's slap in the face gave Donald a hint of pleasure. Hey, let you roll and roll, this is the wonderful taste brought by power. Some of them looked at other police officers as if they were their own authority. His proud eyes had not lasted for a long time, and there was a scene that he could not predict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A police officer took out his police badge and pistol and placed it on the reception desk, leaving the police station one after another. The original busy police station was almost clean in a flash, leaving only a dozen police officers to look at each other and the Mayor of Donald. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrogance on Donald’s face lasted for less than ten seconds, and it became a kind of anger, and the red face was awkward, and he kicked hard. At the reception desk, the words cursing the vicious words turned and left, leaving only the dozens of police officers standing at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The removal of the head of the Hite Police Department was Donald’s second-step plan, but the death of Puxi had to let him advance this plan. No evidence is needed. Donald knows that the death of Puxi and Du Lin have an absolute relationship. This is the style of Doolin's work. Either don't do it, do it to the extreme! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use Hite to investigate this case, let him catch the murderer and the person who has a relationship with the murderer, it may not be caught in a hundred years because They are one and the whole. Therefore, only by lifting the position of Hite, it is possible to turn the police station into its own weapon and become a weapon against the legacy of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he didn’t think of was Hite... No, it should be said that Du Lin had such a high prestige in the police station, actually made a compilation The police station of more than 100 people became an empty shell, which he could not accept. He can only arrange this matter to the police investigation bureau. The police investigation bureau is a vertical management and accepts the dispatch of the local government. Du Lin does not affect these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than ten minutes of this incident, on a commercial street, a luxuriously decorated, palatial store was covered by a group of masked The mob broke open, they snapped all the goods inside, and they put a fire! The blazing flame immediately caught people's attention, and the owner of the store came at the same time as the fire truck arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a little disbelieving to see that he was damaged and burned, with the goods he was going to sell during the spring season. There is still a lot of property. This big fire brought him more than 50,000 pieces! If you add those renovations, you may have more than 80,000 pieces! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
