			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo cherishes his life very much. Almost all esteemed people have this kind of understanding. Their own lives are more important than money, power and status. Because as long as they can continue to live, these things are at their fingertips, and it is only time to get back all that is needed. Compared with these special people, the poor people at the bottom of the society are not worth much. They can take out the knife for ten dollars and risk their imprisonment. They put money into their pockets from other people’s pockets. They can In order to do some dangerous things for a hundred risks, you can sell your life for a thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are always saying that life is equal, but sometimes the weight of life is not as flat as the people imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ornes quickly called the phone to Richard, Richard was still asleep, and struggled to get up when he heard the phone ringing. His private life is very good, but it doesn't matter. He is just a squandered and absurd governor's son. He does not intend to inherit his father's power and family status. This is not a turn for him, and there is a bloodline ratio. He is more pure and half-brother, waiting for the inheritance of his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very open to this, as long as he is happy, then nothing is a problem. Don't say that there are some things that can't be said, even if his father doesn't blame him even more, his stepmother will like him more, and his brother will "respect" him more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his life, his way, he is sensible not to compete with his half-brother, he does not have a noble mother There is no strong "mother-in-law", he only has himself, and a tombstone in the cemetery that has grown moss - his mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After picking up the phone for a few minutes, his mind was blank. He could hear the sound from the receiver, but he couldn’t understand what he could understand. What is the meaning. It wasn't until he patted his cheek that he gradually woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a chuckle in the receiver, just now Sis has repeated it three times. Now he needs to repeat the fourth time. "Mr. Richard, I am Ornes. My boss hopes to see the governor with you this evening. You can arrange it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard woke up and frowned. He walked back and forth a few steps in the temple. "Tonight? It’s too urgent? What about the weekend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "My sincerity, you saw it, now it's your turn to show your credibility... Money and other things are good, but not so easy to get."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Richard is a little annoyed to break the phone, his ninja's inner irritability, whispered: "I understand, I will call you as soon as possible!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he hangs up and considers how to explain this, he will call his governor’s father. Today is Wednesday, his father should still be in the office, he looked at the wall clock hanging on the wall. After waiting for about thirty or forty seconds, the phone was connected, and the familiar voice that could no longer be heard rang in the handset. "This is the governor's office."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am... I have something to say to you." Richard was very careful in wording, constantly lowering his tone, making him look humble, not like between father and son. dialogue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor in the office instinctively wants to hang up, but he also knows that the eldest son’s appearance today is largely due to his indulgence. . To be honest, he can become the governor. His current wife and the family behind his wife have made great contributions, so his current status, political connections and wealth can only be given to his second son. Only then can his eldest son survive a safe and sound life, and will not die in an accident for one day because of an inexplicable thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even if he understands, he is equally a headache for this son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are such strange creatures, I hope that you will fall, but I hope that you will struggle at the same time, at least not so willing, so that you can Let me be more comfortable, because you are struggling, you resist, but you finally lost to my will, lost to the fate to arrange for you, so that I will be a little more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;瞧, most people will have this contradictory desire to control, and the governor is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say, try to be as simple as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard sighed. "A man named Ornes sent me 10,000 yuan yesterday. He and another guy named Solo want to see you again. I hope you can see them. Sincerely make another decision. The other party is very anxious, the time is this evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor did not speak, he opened his own small book and looked at it at night. A charity party. However, this is not important. He will show his face. After all, Richard is his own child. His current situation has a lot to do with himself. Whether he is a father or something else, he is willing to make some compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree, at 7:30 in the evening, the third floor of the Star Restaurant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night 7 Half a point, Bangka walked into the phone booth and dialed Doolin's phone. He saw Solo and Ornes enter the Starlight Restaurant. If there is no accident, they should have a appointment. Starlight Restaurant is a very high-end restaurant in the local area. The main customer base is the upper class, and it is also the kind of high-ranking people. It takes about thirty-eight for a steak here, and one or two hundred for a meal is not a rare thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Du Lin got on the phone, and Bangka turned and shook his head and whispered: "They went to worship, what do you do now?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not long after, the voice of Doolin came from the receiver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s dark, turn off the lights!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short busy tone The voice could no longer be heard. Bangka hung up and snorted and shrugged off the phone booth. He then left in a car, but he left a man to do this. He knew that the local anti-organizational crime investigation bureau had been staring at him, so he was not afraid of anything when he left, just wanted to take those annoying guys away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Bonca guessed, someone was staring at him, and he also listened to his call with Doolin and recorded the call. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analysis team’s first time to get the call record, knowing that this is a killing order, but this call record does not appear as a key evidence. In court, it can even be said that even the evidence is not. Because there are only two sentences in this phone call, and two people who say these two sentences use the whispers between the gangs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voting in the whisper means going to meet the big man, or going to see the leader. It’s dark to represent time or to represent the present, and turning off the lights means solving some people or things. These slang words cannot constitute valid legal evidence, and even if the judge is very clear about what these slang words represent, they cannot adopt this recording. Because from a purely evidence point of view, there is no information about crime at all. If forced interpretation, the jury will certainly not agree, and the law does not allow such a distorted explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that makes them a little bit rewarding is that they know what Bangka is doing. While arranging for people to continue to track Bunka, they added someone to pinpoint the people left by Bangka. If they can seize their crimes on the spot, they will be of great help to the conviction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the time passed by, the agent responsible for monitoring the camera quickly stood up, and the colleague who was responsible for the record was also shocked. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detective responsible for surveillance photos sighed Spoofing, "I saw the Governor’s entry into the Starlight Restaurant just now, and their goal will be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few thoughts on the room The detectives have all chilled, shouldn't it, the risk of assassinating the governor at this level is too great, it is definitely an assassination that can alarm the entire Western world, just like Doolin was assassinated. That way. By then, the entire political arena will be twisted into a rope to target this group of people, even if there is no evidence, Du Lin will not be better, he should not be so stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he and the governor have not heard of any contradictions. Maybe the governor’s presence here is just a coincidence. After all, as the most luxurious restaurant near the town hall, the governor came to eat. Isn't dinner really normal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agent reported to the director while letting the agents in the room go down and preparing to protect the governor’s safety anytime and anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor is not aware that the anti-organizational crime investigation bureau suddenly became busy because of his appearance, he went straight to the booked table, Soro and Europe Nes is already waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men shook hands and sat down. The governor shook his head and said, "To be honest, I really don't like your style of work. You shouldn't go to see it." Chad, he does not belong to this matter, and has nothing to do with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
