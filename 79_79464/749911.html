			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the rotating paper money, the anger in people’s hearts was unexpectedly subsided, and even the police on the side were a little commotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who doesn't want to save money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not for work problems, these police officers may have rushed to huddle with the Guarts who might have evolved into riots in the last second. Those banknotes fell into their pockets during the competition of these people. The policemen on the side of the police showed an envious look. It was a good luck, and they could encounter such a good thing. Some people looked up and saw the figure of a banknote on the tall building next to it, and there was no envy in that heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap is too big, only looking up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking downstairs to change the original intention of the Guar in order to fight for the banknotes, Scott smiled and shook his head, this may be ordinary people and rich people The gap between thoughts. In his opinion, this sudden outbreak, the massive riots are difficult to calm down. If they can't satisfy the demands of these people, they will never retreat. Even if the mayor knows the news, he will ask the counseling bureau and relevant people who have experience in dealing with similar situations. The people give him a reply. The face is getting worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But who can think of it, when many people think that the Navy may need to suppress these people, Doolin throws money out and the world changes immediately Quiet, this is the different ways of thinking brought about by different status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guars raised their hands together. They have forgotten what they are going to do here. There is only one thing in their minds, that is money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a poor person, small money is also money, not to mention the fluttering paper is not a small amount of money. If you can compete for ten twenty sheets, it will be equivalent to one month's salary! This is too attractive for people whose family conditions are very embarrassing. Who in the face of money remembers who Abihan is? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several people in the crowd who are disappointed. These people are members of the small group of Abigail. When they first learned that Abienne was When a person murders at home, he does not think of revenge for Abien, nor is it sad or sad, but a faint excitement. The mountains that were pressed against their heads finally collapsed, and they could have a day to come. When Abbey was there, he always took the most, because people recognized him. Now that he is dead, is it their turn to be the master? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also this group of people who even incited the riots. They hope to achieve two goals in this way. The first purpose was to clean up the death loyalty of Abidin. The second purpose was to attract the attention of the managers of the city of Illian. Then they stood up to calm the riot and step on Abid and the compatriots. The body went to the stage he left behind. But unfortunately, all this failed in this damn money rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money rain quickly turned into a coin rain, and the crowd crowded a little, which is why Du Lin considered that overcrowding might cause a stampede event. of. A large number of coins were sprinkled, and people turned from holding their hands to bending over and licking their ass, opening the distance between each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when the sky is no longer falling, these Guartes are still waiting, but at this time, a loud Applause caught their attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a young, very kind-looking guy in an expensive suit standing not far from them, his smile is as bright as the sun, he The sound is also very good, there is a magnetic full of magic, can make people calm down, listen carefully to what he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you satisfied with my meeting?" Du Lin pulled out a dollar bill from his pocket and bounced it. The crisp sound is fascinating. "I have been thinking about how I should meet with you. The first time I meet, I should give you a meeting. As you can see, I am a businessman, a rich man. Businessman, I don't know much about any small gifts that will satisfy everyone, so I think I will give you the money and then you choose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A five- or six-year-old boy ran out of the crowd. He ran to Du Lin in the eyes of people's worries and looked at the one-dollar banknote held between Du Lin's fingers. Du Lin bent down and touched his head and gave the money to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Doolin, and some people call me Mr. 350,000!", there are some exclamations in the Guartes, this time people I think that the purpose of their gathering here is to seek justice for Abbey, but they can put the "enemy" money into their pockets without knowing it, which makes them very embarrassed and do not know how it is good. As for letting them re-extract the money and then find Du Lin confrontation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, can't do it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was also very clear about the mentality of these people. He didn't care if he played his own hat. "I know why you are here, and I know what happened in the fifth district. I hope that you can calmly think about it. Is it necessary for me to murder a compatriot who lives in the fifth district?" Du Lin gradually became serious. He shook his fingers and said with a very calm voice, his chin proudly said: "No!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no need for this. I know that some people are pouring dirty water on me, saying that I am relying on taking a private mouth and opening a black mine to make a fortune. I am also rich in blood. I also know that they have said that they are more ridiculous to hurt me, to swear at me, but I don't care. You saw the dog on the side of the road yelling at you, you can call it back with it. Or bite it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laughter in the crowd gradually spread, and the atmosphere relaxed at once, and Du Lin shrugged his shoulders. "I do Not enough, after all, I am full of bloody three Mr. Wu Wan!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The reason why we are here today is because the blood flowing from our blood vessels is from the blood of the first king, what you believe in. God is also my faith. All the Guars in this world are the same family. The behaviors and practices of yours are too extreme, which will make those who provoke you to appear here to be ruthless. It will make your family, parents, and children sad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know? Just before I came, the navy’s warships were already docked, only You need to move forward a few more steps, they will start to suppress!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words suddenly caused a slight commotion, some timid The small person has begun to retreat and plans to return to the fifth district. They may not have seen the real scene of the garrison's suppression of the riots, but they have heard people say it, and still laugh at this tragic process as news or jokes. But when it was their turn to face such a thing, they suddenly became scared. At that time, even if they were kneeling on the ground, it was useless to ask for mercy. A bullet took a life and brought a medal and glory to those navies. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I came, I can’t watch my compatriots bleed here and die, and I’m indifferent. The first king gave me a heavy responsibility, no matter what I want. Or don't want to, as a gult I have to take this responsibility. I hope that you can calm down, then send a representative to talk to me, talk to the commissioner around me, instead of using this stupid Method to express your own ideas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
