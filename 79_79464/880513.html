			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May Doolin, do you need a break?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just came down from the ramp When it came to Hossington who came to meet him, the Mayor of Hossington smiled and tried to put on a sincere look as much as possible, but Du Lin knew that he was not so familiar with this guy. When he escorted the smuggling merchants, Hossington was one of the first to stand up and tried to use Harry to pressure Du Lin. He did not expect Du Lin to pull Harry into his camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to having Magus as the team of Doolin, the SAR has become the consensus of the people, but it has not yet had time to list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been news from the emperor's side. After the new city hall is completed, the city will be listed for the city of Otis. The full name will be from Audi. The City Hall of the City has become the "Otis Special Administrative Region City Hall". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horseton certainly won’t be so happy, originally he and his mentor wanted to pressure Du Lin for a while, then wait for Du Lin to stand for help. They will be Ladulin. In return, Du Lin should fully support the position of Holden on the governor in the next general election. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan is very good, and indeed some rich people have been slaughtered by them, but they are picking the wrong object, Du Lin is not the kind of person people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and looked at Hossington and took the initiative to reach out and shook his hand, and the other hand pressed on the back of the hand that Holden’s hand extended. Going up to Doolin is like the elder of Hoxton, or his superior. Hossington sneaked a slap in the hand, did not pull back, can only face Du Lin's hateful smile silently. Looking at his sulking appearance, Du Lin was very happy and laughed more cheerfully. "Please call me Mr. Du Lin. This time I attended the completion ceremony as a private person, which does not mean any position!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing his release, Hossington took a sigh of relief and his face was a little less than a false smile. "Okay, Mr. Doolin." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you need a break? It’s not so comfortable for such a long journey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin Laughing and taking a shot of Hossington’s shoulder, he jumped his eyebrows twice. “No, you have forgotten it. Now the steam locomotive has a first class cabin, and there is a very loose private space. There is also a recliner that can become a bed. I am resting all the way. I am so good now." He looked at the eighth district on the hillside in the distance, and it is foreseeable that the city will have great development prospects in the future. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group did not go to the hotel and went directly to the 8th district. Many people on the road saw Du Lin say hello. In this city, Du Lin’s reputation is still very high. Whether it is good reputation or bad reputation, it is always right. He often nodded to the people who greeted him, and some people would surprise to say a few words, and the trip was naturally slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may not be reconciled to become Doolin’s background. After Houston sinned, he left first, and Du Lin glanced at his background. After two laughs, I turned my attention to those who greeted me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While passing by her estate, Freina was standing at the door, she changed a very well-dressed dress, it looked very amazing. Taking advantage of Doolin’s arm and walking towards the hillside, he whispered, “Guess what I found?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s head Some curiously looking at her, "Meet your desires, what did you find?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena covers her mouth and nose at the Doolin ear Whispered, "I heard that Hossington nominated you to be the mayor of Otis. The reason is that someone is circulating a message saying that you may be running for the mayor of Irian City, so he will send you immediately. Go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news is really what Du Lin didn't know. He also had a kind of enlightenment. No wonder this guy is impatient. Kicking yourself out, the original problem came from this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, within the scope of the entire empire, there are about a dozen mayors in the city, the local rich have suddenly stood up before the election to express their desire to run for the mayor. Finally defeated the former old mayor and became the new mayor. This situation is very common. A rich man, especially a monopoly, is like a unique business card for a city. It is like the steel tycoon Knight of the Western Steel City, the rubber tycoon of the southern city of Sirius. Fantas... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the richest people are business cards that remind people of a city in a flash, so the potential of the rich to participate in the campaign is unique, and it carries various advantages. People like to be richer than to like the mayor, it is not surprising that they can successfully get the ballot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Doolin’s prestige, good and bad together, even if someone wants to oppose him, he doesn’t necessarily dare to stand up against him, more likely It is to close your mouth and silently cast a vote of your abstention to express your dislike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Du Lin is so rich, he can launch the Jinyuan offensive, and maybe he can really take Hossington to the throne of the mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head with a smile, and did not expect these insiders behind the scene. He glanced at the sunny Irian and whispered: "This guy is going to run for the governor four years later?", Freena nodded. Most people know that Du Lin’s mysterious smile, did not continue. The other party can give him a stick because of factors that don't exist at all, so he can naturally take all the paper while the other person goes to the toilet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reciprocity is coming, nothing more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not far from walking to the eighth district. When the town hall was planning this piece, it was going to combine the eighth district with the city center. Instead of building two completely divided urban areas. It takes only ten minutes to walk from Doolin's manor to the streets of the eighth district. Just entering the area, you can see colorful balloons floating everywhere. There are also a few projects with a slightly smaller amount of work to be completed, all with colored strips and balloons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amusement park is located on the east side of the 8th district, and you can see the gates of an old castle and the towering entertainment facilities. Many people from the local celebrities in Ilyan gathered here. They saw Du Lin greeted him after he arrived, and Du Lin also returned one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time quickly pointed to 9:30 in the morning, Doolin and Hossington and Jose were standing on the ribbon-cutting table, with the order of the host Colorful balloons skyrocketed, and a pair of red silks also landed. A large number of white pigeons took off, and the scene was very lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People speak of compliments and surround Du Lin in the middle. He is the protagonist of today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horston stood outside the crowd with a cold face and snorted twice, leaving directly. Here, including the people here, he feels nausea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it’s completed, it’s not as good as everyone’s coming in. Du Lin’s group of people wandered around in the amusement park, and from time to time there will be some They are either familiar or unfamiliar in the scenes of the movie, actively mobilizing people's emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, that's the white pearl!", a young girl who followed the parents into the amusement park and shouted at the boat reflecting the sun in a steel monster in the distance. The white pearl is the famous movie pirate. The protagonist’s boat, they took the ship and defeated the evil pirates across the seven seas – a group of degraded dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final battle, the ship was sunk by the pirate’s shelling, and many viewers were very sorry. I didn’t expect to see it here. The boat is really amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the suggestion of a staff member, some young people and children were delighted to board the White Pearl pirate ship, with the pendulum-style machinery starting Swinging the arm, the pirate ship swings back and forth like a pendulum of the clock, as if sailing in the sea. At the highest time, it was almost flush with the ground at 90 degrees, which caused many people to scream continuously, and the people on the crowd were shocked by a cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin screamed at Jose. "Is this stuff safe?" He didn't want to suddenly tell someone that one day, your amusement park happened. The accident will then face huge compensation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jose nodded very seriously: "Boss, this machine made a total of two sets, respectively, conducted stress tests and fatigue tests, did not find any In addition, we have other protective measures, even if the arm is broken, it will not cause accidents. In short, I don't understand the specifics. Their engineers said that they can guarantee that there is no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin was ready to say something, his eyes were stiff. He patted his head and almost forgot a very important thing. Fortunately, he came to the amusement park this time, otherwise he might really miss this opportunity. Of course, the timing of this matter is not yet mature, and he can operate after he has harvested a wave from the Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin, who had a happy mood, took more time to take everyone around the amusement park, including the villains that would make all the horror movies The dark lair that hits all, the shape of a dragon with a mouth open, people going in from the mouth of the dragon, and then there will be many scary scenes and characters. There is also a war bastion that symbolizes the kingship. Many of the people who came to visit were put on clothes, holding wooden weapons and wrapped in a layer of cotton cloth, killing them on a small battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Du Lin is very satisfied with the amusement park, but also changed many people think that the amusement park is a few carousels, several swings, to pass the time to the children. Misconceptions. Many people are discussing the play projects in the amusement park when Du Lin left, and I can see that everyone is very satisfied! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
