			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As everyone knows, I am sick, very serious fever, and I am killed at once. Some little classmates think that my people have collapsed. In these few days, I have been thinking about a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone asked me what a dream is, I think this is a very naive question, and how to be full of dreams is always something you can only see and can’t touch. People should bow to reality. But I am wrong. People should have dreams. There should be courage to abandon everything to pursue dreams. We can have no wings, but dreams will give us the power to fly between reality and reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like reading. From the beginning of kindergarten, I like to watch all kinds of comic strips. Later, I read a lot of books. I like the magnificence of words. I like the heavyness of the text. I like to explore all the secrets of the world in the lines of Xuanqi. I like to shuttle through the historical maze of text formation. I know deeply that I like words, just like blood flowing in the blood, but a paragraph of text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should give up my dream for a job, give up my love for words, and turn myself into someone I didn’t like? Even if this is the most realistic thing in the world? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I was sick, I felt that I should give up. The people around me said that I should give up. Maybe many book friends are not clear about the nature of my current job, because For some reasons, I can't express it directly. To put it simply, it is the provincial service unit secretariat. Leaders appreciate me more and are trying to train me to the Secretary-General. I am grateful to the leaders for their appreciation. Thanks for giving me this opportunity. I also thank the leaders and the units for letting me meet with many great people who are qualified to sit on a table with a big meal and have a meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the intertwined, I think this kind of work may be a good job, work hard for a few years, try to be a secretary-general, and then This is a springboard and goes to a higher place. Before retiring, try to solve the problem of children, and this life will be safe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between me, I sighed with a sigh, but the next second I sat up in my dreams! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When? ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, actually lost my dream? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
