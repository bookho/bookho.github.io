			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Xerma’s mouth is slightly tilted, and then he is very understated, but he is afraid that Du Lin can’t hear the mood of his own appearance, seemingly plain. Something he has done. The more he said, the more Dulin listened to, and he didn't even know when the half-cut cigarette between his fingers fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the shocked appearance of his son, Mr. Xema was finally comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Mr. Xiaoxma’s return, his status has plummeted and has reached the second place. This is the first time in such history that such a serious cruel level Demotion. Fortunately, he recovered a little happiness from Du Lin, which made him very satisfied, and spit out all the depressed gas during this time. Finally, he summed it up, "The doorman is just a despicable businessman and a thief. I don't like him. You can help me get him."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Mr. Xerma’s letter, Du Lin, knew that there must be some secrets after Mr. Dolma’s reading. So many places were smeared not to prevent Du Lin found that in order to prevent those who might peek at the letter, the original doorman was such a person. As for the content written by Mr. Kesma himself, there is no matter what cannot be said, and naturally there is no cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can think that his father who lived in the country for a lifetime actually used to be an "angry youth" with hands-on ability, not only inciting the slave riots of some nobles, before and after After killing a lot of nobles, he became a nightmare in the hearts of the nobility. Even now, it is estimated that the legend is circulating in the nobility, no wonder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head with a funny smile. He leaned back on the guardrail and looked up at the deep blue sky. The bright stars were looming, and there was no difference from the childhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want me to do?", he looked at Mr. Xerma. Mr. Kesma took off the pipe in his mouth and smashed it on the guardrail. Some blackened tobacco leaves with Mars falling in the dirt under the guardrail. He took out a small pocket of sheepskin from his pocket and took out some shredded tobacco with two fingers and re-plugged it in. Du Lin took out a lighter and set him on fire. Houguang reflected his half face. He glanced at Du Lin and said, "Give him where he should go!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he finished, he took a breath and the flames went in into the pipe. After taking two more shots, he patted Du Lin’s back. “I didn’t intend to care about him. We are the old guys who survived. We are not much, but he has paid attention to you and my grandson. He does not give us an explanation. It is absolutely impossible to say. Moreover, he also pointed his gun at himself, which is why I cannot Forgive him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Mr. Kesma retired in such a remote place as Zijing Town, he also has his own "intelligence" network. His intelligence network is not professional at all, many of the slaves he has helped, and the poor. These people overthrew everything in the past after the New Party came to power, and they were liberated. They are grateful to what Mr. Zema has done for them, giving them the opportunity to live in this free world and breathe the air of freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once they find something, as long as they feel valuable, they will write down a friend who sent it to Mr. Send it to Mr. Xema. This is a passive intelligence network, and Mr. Xerma does not intend to use this intelligence network to do anything, just to understand the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some time ago, the party’s party whip had a sudden heart attack. Although it was rescued, the guy and the governor of Cannes once had no difference. I can only lie in bed and wait for death. If this is only a small problem that happens occasionally after the aging of the body, Mr. Xerma will not do anything, only send blessings. But this is not an accident, it is the idea of ​​the doorman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He betrayed his own, although he is not a Guar, but he should be tried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?", I didn’t see Du Lin’s thoughts for a long time, which made Mr. Xema a little annoyed. He said so much. Want to hear Du Lin's thoughts? His face was stretched a little longer, so he licked two cigarettes and asked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought for a moment, "His set of national welfare programs can't be successful, it's hard to say, maybe I don't need to do it, it will Someone killed him. But since it is your request, I will give him the trial from the first king and the gods at the last moment. If he can accept the trial and get forgiveness, maybe I will let him go."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Du Lin’s opinion, the Mennon is actually looking for a dead end. He wants the votes in the hands of the voters, and he wants to “sell” the voters to the capitalists and let the capitalists have more The excuse to exploit them. If his plan fails, it will be fine. Once it is successful, those under the capital of the capitalists will definitely be disgusted with the doormen. At this time, losing the support of the voters and losing the hearts of the people is enough to prove that his concept of administration is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need for Du Lin to do it, the speculative elements in the Kadima party will take the initiative to stand up and give the angry voters an account of their support for the Kadima Party. The doorman who is a victim will never have a good end. This is certain. Those who were persecuted by him and who were driven away by him would become knives that broke into his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for true success? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin feels that it is difficult to succeed. The welfare is the beginning of the federalism. In fact, this is the joint venture between the federal capitalists and the federal government to deceive ordinary citizens. A means. The federal government wants more liquidity for the country's construction, while the merchants hope that the workers in their hands will not leave after their own exploitation, from the initial reluctance to willingly exploit themselves and continue to exploit them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is the welfare thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welfare is synonymous with three major parts of federal citizenship benefits, medical benefits, education benefits, and pension benefits, which are said to be intended to add new benefits. project. At present, these three major benefits are purely superficial, and indeed create a beautiful world where both morality and reality coexist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical benefits, as long as you pay 3 percent of your monthly income, you can reduce some or all of your medical expenses when a major illness breaks out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educational benefits, pay a certain fee each year, when your child is in college, only need to pay 20% of the tuition fee to enter school, this Also saved a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pension benefits are paid at 5% of the monthly income, and after the retirement at the age of 55, the pension from the federal government can be obtained every month. gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the three benefits are paid, the more benefits will be earned in the future. The federal government does not insist on how much to pay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks perfect, isn't it? And federal citizens seem to have taken the “fees” of paying these benefits as part of their lives and consciously paying these fees. But in fact, there is a deviation in people's understanding, that is, inflation. It can be quite understood that Du Lin’s money can now be used to find a good restaurant in Tener to eat his stomach, but after he retired at the age of 55, thirty-six years later, It may not be enough to buy a newspaper for a dollar at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, it is precisely because the federal government constantly promotes the benefits of various benefits, and continues to use one example to tell people that you will be miserable after paying no money, so every citizen in the federation must work seriously because Losing work means that you can't pay these fees, which means that when they are old, or they are sick, or when they need to go to college, they don't get as much benefits as others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they have to work, even if the capitalists are somewhat exploited, they must work hard on the scalp. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a saying that the federal capital, a country that used to be a business alliance, has a variety of ways for capitalists to "slave" and exploit the labor force. The simplest thing is that they have a pension. This is a kind of corporate welfare. Every month, part of the money is paid in the company. When you retire, you can get 200% or even 3% in one breath. Four hundred total returns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four knives are cut down, assuming that a worker can take one hundred federal shields a month, the three major benefits have already paid about 10%, and then the enterprise Take 5 percent, and then pay a tax ranging from 7 percent to 11 percent. When the salary is 100 yuan, it will be 70 yuan. Don't worry, you have to pay taxes in the federal government. It is clear that the money in the hands of the citizens has been taken away by the tax system. It is a clean money. When you buy something, you have to pay taxes, because businessmen and capitalists put The tax that should have been paid by itself was passed on to consumers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary of the seventy-dollars, if used for consumption, is actually their own, only about sixty dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monthly salary of one hundred dollars, and the real fifty dollars, the federal art has taken the art of exploitation to the limit. Under the circumstance of mutual cooperation, people have to live according to the games made by the federal government and capitalists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No work, no guarantees, no benefits, so they must work. If you work, you must be serious. Even if you encounter unfair treatment and harsh treatment, you can't change your job. Because the pension will be recalculated after changing jobs, the longer you work, the less you dare to change jobs. At this time they also pray that the company should not go bankrupt, and through their own efforts to make the company profitable, because once the company goes bankrupt, their retirement for several years and even decades is finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
