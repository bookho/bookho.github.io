			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s two creased ten-yuan denomination notes firmly attracted William’s attention, if not considering his small body is not suitable for fighting If you don't think that there are two people on the other side, he even gave birth to the idea of ​​robbery. The pulsation of his heart made the blood flow faster and the complexion became more rosy. Twenty dollars is not a small amount of money. For an intelligence dealer who is so mixed with such occasions and grades, this may be money that can be earned in a week or more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information This thing is depreciating very quickly. Just after he sold the information for three dollars, it may be worthless when he turned back. The intelligence is Fast money, can't last. And many times the information bought has not yet been sold, and other places have flooded and spread. Every sale of intelligence is a gamble, earning money is actually hard money, but also to face the possibility of tracing from the content of the content parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when he saw the twenty dollars, he vowed to get it. He glared at his waist, revealing his most humble appearance, and his mouth could hang on his ear, and he nodded slightly and continuously. "You may not know, in these two blocks, everyone knows my reputation as William." There is no intelligence that I can't get..." This is his bragging about himself, and he also hints at the next sentence he didn't say - as long as you have enough money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that the two young guys in front of him can understand what he wants to say, so he smiles with confidence and pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s banknotes were turned over and over in his fingers. He smiled and smiled. “The message I want is very simple...”, when Du Lin spoke Dudu had moved to the side and blocked the passage to the alley. Du Lin turned and leaned on the back door of the bar, completely blocking William's retreat. If William is not covered by twenty dollars at this time, he should be able to feel the faint maliciousness of these people, but unfortunately, he has no money to cover his eyes, or a charming look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to know who sent you a fake message to Xien."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp William stunned. He didn't seem to understand the first thing Du Lin said. When he was thinking about it, a squeaky feeling like an electric shock filled his body instantly. His hair was It’s almost erected, and the skin is full of goose bumps. At the moment he turned and rushed to the Buddha, Du Lin pushed a hand. Under the imbalance of gravity, he walked a few steps forward, and he was planted in the back lane full of stench on the ground, and fell a dog to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufu stepped on his back, reaching out and holding his hair up, and with the help of an incandescent lamp at the back of the bar, he could barely see the subtle changes in his face. The apple muscles filled with fear and trembling are like little mice with restlessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft tapping from the ear made William’s trembling worse. He looked up and looked at a black shadow carrying his light on his In front of him, his flustered eyes looked at other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I know you are lying, don't you say that your message is the most up-to-date?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When William is afraid, he can still close his mouth. He does not say that he may not die, but he must have lived for a long time. After the death of Gotol, the group of people immediately began to sweep the ground, and in the absence of anyone to stop him, the underground world of the entire city is now almost firmly controlled by them. Just a few moments ago, a short infighting broke out among the core members of the flames. The original leader was slaughtered, and an inconspicuous guy succeeded in the upper position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is called Lewis, probably in his thirties, the provincial sage, an awkward northern accent. He is more decisive, more hot and more decisive than the previous leader. As long as someone dares to touch the rules he has made, he will never be merciless, no matter who he is and how good he is. The cruel law of strict enforcement has caused the entire underground world to change quietly, and the instructor behind the William mission is the one sent by Lewis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is an intelligence dealer, so he knows a lot of news, precisely because he knows a lot of news, so he is even more fearful. He knows that if a person in the world really wants to get a message, then this information can't be hidden by anyone. Maybe someone behind the door is eavesdropping, maybe the third floor. There are hidden ears in the window of the open black hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t dare to say that he didn’t want to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmly calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that our friend is a tough guy, then you should give him the treatment he deserves!", Du Lin is actually joking, a group of people selling by to make money How many people are tough guys? None of them, William does not say that he just thinks that he does not say what he bears, far from what he said is more deadly. Dooling needs to make him soberly aware that the two results are actually the same, just a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo’s other hand flipped over and there was a dagger in his hand. The dagger blade was two inches long, only one finger wide, and the sharp curved edge reflected in the night and the light. A touch of cold. He put the blade on William's neck, but just seeing it, there was a blood line on William's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin squatted down and put his hands on his knees and patted William's cheek. "Do you believe in God?" He pointed to the sky, " Many people believe in God and think that after death, they will return to the embrace of God and go to heaven to enjoy endless joy and well-being. Some people meditate on the name of God and do bad things. They always think that they can go to heaven, you are Such a person? Do you faithfully believe in God and be sure that you can go to heaven after you die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clear with a viscous saliva from William The corner of his mouth flowed out. He wanted to swallow the saliva that was secreted in his mouth, but the blade pressed at the throat made him afraid to swallow. There is a pleading in his eyes, he does not want to die, and does not want to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must be a devout believer, God will be very happy when he sees you, because one of his followers is betrayed and "The new ethnic group betrayed for a living.", said Du Lin stretched his index finger around the neck. "Since our intelligence workers have good professional ethics, we should not embarrass him, send him to see God!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second William can feel that Doolin is not scaring him, the guy holding his hair is more forceful to rub his head up, neck stretch Tight, he can feel the edge of the cut has been cut into the skin, life is at stake. At this critical juncture, he exhausted his whole body and leaned back, escaping the knife that cut his throat. "I said, don't kill me, I said!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s face suddenly smiled. He made a gesture, and he loosened his legs and feet and pulled William up from the ground. Dooling took a cigarette and dipped it into William's mouth. He also helped him sort out the messy hair. "Hey, it's not that difficult, isn't it? Say what I want, I leave this, You also leave this." Du Lin Wen Ya is like a gentleman in the upper class. His smile looks hard to make people feel bad, but in William's eyes, Du Lin is a demon from hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William licked his neck, an inch of narrow mouth was spilling blood, the blood flowed out fast, the wound was not deep, not fatal . His violent beating heart gave him an unprecedented desire to survive. He didn't want to lose his life at this moment. He didn't believe in the old mixed ball in the sky. He only believed in the money in his own pocket. He took a deep breath, his eyes continually sweeping around the surrounding windows and the lanes, and he lowered his voice and said, "I am the person of Lewis who informed me, I said, can you let me go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
