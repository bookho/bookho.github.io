			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin said that he has time tomorrow night...", a very elegant room with three men and one woman, and the other three men are Southern Commercial Bank Executive Director of the Board of Directors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more conclusions reached by the analysis team formed by the bank’s internal economic and financial experts, the higher the focus of the Southern Commercial Bank’s insurance business, which is a low risk. In the high-return industry, the most important thing is that the insurance business can bring a lot of cash flow to the bank. Any investment is more important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the bank seems to be very rich. They always say how much cash they have in the vault. This will also deceive those ordinary depositors. A large amount of funds in the bank have actually been transferred for short-term profit-making activities such as investment, and some are used for long-term investments such as farms and ranches, which are also very risky. It can only be said that in the field of investment, especially in the field of stocks and futures, banks are big players, they have more money, and the risks are slightly smaller, just a little smaller. They also need cash flow to deal with all kinds of financial disasters that may happen at any time. Often, an inexplicable policy can destroy an industry, and even bring all investors who have invested a lot of money in this industry into the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the imperial central bank used some shameful means to try to beat the southern commercial banks by means of a run, so many businessmen stood up and defended the southern commercial banks. The benefits, but this does not mean that there will be no risk of a run in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, war, if there is any signal of war, ordinary people will not hesitate to withdraw money from the bank and buy a lot of life. The accumulation of materials at home will inevitably lead the Southern Commercial Bank to the bankruptcy liquidation because it is unable to meet the withdrawal requirements. Or there has been a big policy volatility in an industry. In the past few years, some of the policies formulated by the cabinet have always been unpredictable, and then one industry has been hit hard, for example, the anti-monopoly law some time ago. And the Anti-Industry Manipulation Act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that no one in the civil society has been hurt by these two bills, but look at the tycoons who monopolize the industry, one by one. . It was not all day suspected that the manipulation industry was under investigation, that is, faced with a huge monopoly fine, and one industry trust was eventually dismembered by the cabinet as a fragment. Investors who invested a lot of money in these people and their companies have lost all their lives, and many people have jumped upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks actually have a little more trouble than ordinary companies, that is, they need to pay interest to those depositors. According to the Hawthorne rule – this is a “conscience” banker who claims that more than fifty accounts can earn interest, but accounts with less than fifty must be charged a management fee. In the past, people didn't like to put money in the bank. They didn't trust the bank. They even wanted to find a corner in the house to dig a hole to hide the money, or to put it in the bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This land method has brought a devastating blow to economic construction and the healthy circulation of money. Of course, this is another matter. Hawthorne is an alternative way of storing money, and the first banker to put money in the bank to get more money. At that time, many people thought that he was stupid, because the more depositors and funds the bank recruited, the more interest they would bear. If their profit rate could not match the interest paid to the depositors, no one would need to stop them. Can be bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This behavior itself can be said to exacerbate the burden on the bank, but it also catalyzes the flow of idle funds from the society into the bank - after he invested in and executed the rule Within the bank, the standard of minimum storage of 50 is basically completed, allowing banks to obtain more money to compete with their peers and have a greater say in the financial industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the field that has a relationship with money, whoever has more money is awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone said that Horsen was a conspiracy, he was going to bankrupt all the banks he didn’t invest in, but now people need to thank him because he is more People are willing to put money in the bank to eat the insignificant interest, instead of being buried in a dark corner waiting for the mold. Banks use more funds to control the industry, invest or forcibly invest in certain companies to obtain a long-term stable profit channel, part of the money earned to pay the depositor interest, and the other part continues to enter the rolling income link. Create greater profits for the bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial circle is always at risk, and there will never be too obvious warnings that will suddenly appear, destroying all buildings and slowing down go away. The easiest way to fight against such risks is to have money, a lot of money, and more to face the financial turmoil or the economic crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the decision within the Southern Commercial Bank is to get the insurance business as much as possible, enter the industry, and then get more "security." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people in this room are the representatives of the Southern Commercial Bank, who will be fully responsible for the cooperation and negotiations with Du Lin. It seems that their attitude is better. At least they have no counterclaim to Du Lin. In fact, this is not the case. Because the imperial central bank has already done it, they do not need to continue to do it. As long as the imperial central bank can win the lawsuit, they will win the lawsuit. So why bother to recruit people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya looked at the other three with a microphone, one of them, thirty-seven and eighty-year-old, very stylish young people thought about it, "The day after tomorrow." In the evening, the Imperial Hotel, the seventh floor.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Hotel is one of the best hotels in the imperial, and is on the same level as the Kailemen. Even a little higher. It is said that this is a hotel with a royal investment background, the grade is very high, and the consumption is of course high. Now, as long as this society is expensive with the aristocrats, what about this hotel with the emperor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya nodded slightly, let go of her hand and smiled and said in a very gentle tone. "I don't know if Mr. Doolin has the time tonight... ...well, ok, I and the executive director of Nanshang are waiting for you on the seventh floor of the Imperial Hotel...Yes, goodbye!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He Promise?", the young man in the middle of the 37-year-old took a breath and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya nodded and put down the receiver in his hand. "Yes, he promised, he said he will come."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 37-year-old youth haha ​​laughed twice. "Very good, this shows that the sisters of the Hill family did not settle Du Lin. This is an opportunity." He shook his head. "So what I have been saying, don't let our management and board of directors keep in the hands of those who are stubborn in their stubborn behavior. We all know that Doolin is important, but the Imperial Bank only sends The sisters of the Hill family went to him. If I changed to me, I would think they looked down on me. This is why I came here personally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although everyone It is an executive director, except for Natiya, but his position in the bank is also high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man is called Angelo. He has a very unknown name that can make many big people feel nervous, Di Plesi. Yes, he is an important member of the shadow family. He has mastered a part of the shares of Southern Commercial Bank. The specific quantity has not been announced. He is currently one of the shareholders holding the most shares of the Central African Commercial Bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Southern Commercial Bank comes from a loose banking union, and in order to fight against the central bank, many businessmen put their own money into these banks, ensuring that these banks will not be bankrupt, which greatly reduces the number of shareholders. The proportion of shares in the company. The Diplecier family also invested some money in the Southern Commercial Bank, and now Angelo is the biggest beneficiary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two executive directors can only smile and nod to endorse his opinions. This is not a conflict of interest with them. Why do you want to deny others a bad feeling? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anglio pressed his hand to the side and leaned against the sofa to reveal a thoughtful look. "The sisters of Hill's family did not succeed, indicating Du Lin and I don't like to eat these delicious melons. He doesn't lack money. What do you think he wants?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two executive directors glanced at each other and shook Shaking his head, one of them said, "It depends on whether Miss Natiya can find this key."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We still have two days, Natiya The next thing needs to be called to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my honor, Mr. Angelo.", Nadia's voice is still So gentle, people can't help but not feel good about her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the Social Service Bureau officer who took Doolin’s 10,000 yuan gave Du Lin a call at noon, telling Du Lin Their director heard that Du Lin was a person who likes to make friends and is also a generous person. He wants to meet Du Lin. The time is agreed to be at 3 pm on the weekend, at the largest open-air hockey stadium outside the Imperial Capital. This is a good piece of good news, meaning that Du Lin’s new friend accepted Du Lin’s friendship and did not live up to it. Du Lin and his chattered a few words and hung up the phone. The other party seems to be reluctant to say it on the phone. too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weekend, that is, the day after tomorrow, this is the first weekend to enter August, and will be held next Monday. During this time, Adams has been in Oak Bay. The villa is busy. Then Du Lin made a phone call and answered Kevin. Kevin has not been there in the past few days. As the only hooligan lawyer in the empire that is 100% winning... Others are so called, he must be able to reinforce Du Lin in the villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is your situation over there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
