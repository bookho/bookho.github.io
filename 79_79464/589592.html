			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study is very ordinary, there are no rare antiques, no value for the city's collection, three huge bookcases filled with a variety of books. Some books are new, and some of them have worn out to reveal the linen used to prevent breakage in cardboard. Hundreds of these books are a small part of the collection of old people and the most part of the book. The old man is reading a book all his life, as long as he thinks of a valuable book, he will read it very carefully and leave detailed notes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man graduated from a higher school, has a good academic performance, struggled for a lifetime, fluctuated several times, and finally became a member of parliament before he retired. A member of the city of Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are not new things, they existed during the feudal monarchy, but the place where the members of the parliament worked was called the "Imperial Union Council". The work on weekdays is often to deal with disputes between aristocrats and civilians, as well as disputes between nobles and nobles, and occasionally related to the formulation of national affairs, but in many cases the final result in this regard is that the emperor has the final say. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the New Party succeeded in turning the old party to the ground, the functions and powers of parliamentarians and parliament have undergone tremendous changes. Considering that the entire empire was actually taken from the aggression of the Yaoxing Imperial royal family, there has been more or less resistance in the locality. Most of these people were nobles of a certain dynasty, or privileged people. They were not willing to become a civilian, an ordinary person, so they often made a little trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of parliamentarians can be reflected at this time. They are the megaphones that the grassroots ask for at the top, and can transfer some reasonable dissatisfaction from the grassroots to the high-level ears. In the middle, the policy of the region is adjusted by the senior management. At the same time, they are also the high-level understanding, mastery, and control of the local tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that a member of Parliament should be a service-oriented position, but the power of this position has been indefinitely expanded so much that the power of the member The mayor of a city will not be inferior or even stronger. In this period when only a few people can afford the telegram, and the telephone is only a characteristic product of several cities, this uploaded post provides great space and convenience for the members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional members now have the rules of the game that set the empire as a game, and power is once again magnified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man slowly walked down to the cane chair and sat down on the back of the chair. The face quickly flashed a painful expression and then became indifferent. This is his old problem. It takes too long to work in the garden, and there is too much time to bend over. When he straightens up and straightens up, it will bring a bit of pain. But strangely, he enjoyed this pain, even for a short moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what I want to beat you?", he took a pair of copper wire eyes out of his chest pocket and pulled out a piece I bought a hundred or more eyes and what kind of leather and other things wiped the lens. The two legs of the glasses were shackled with two silver ropes and hung around his neck, just like the elderly in many middle-class families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon lowered his head and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man in front of him looks no different from most old people. He likes to raise flowers and raise grass. He likes to waste time in taking care of those companies. On plants that cannot move, I like to look at the book by the sun on the edge of the window... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he understands that behind this old man, on the other side where the sun can never shine, is another look, a horrifying look . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man wiped the glasses for a while, then placed the glasses on the bridge of the nose. He slightly covered his chest, lowered his head, and rolled his eyes through the eyes. The gap between the glasses looked at Gedall. "I know you don't understand. You are exactly the same as twenty years ago. You can't help it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; When the old man said this, Cedore breathed a sigh of relief, because he knew that at least he should not have any big problems this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an old topic. Twenty years ago, Cedore, who had just started serving the elderly, once had a brief meeting with the old man. During this meeting, a passer-by took out a gun and fired three shots at the old man. The blood flowed to the ground. It was not the old man but the Gothor. That assassination of Gotall almost embraced God and returned to the embrace of God, but he came over and seized the second most important opportunity in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in the hospital, the old man asked him why he had to stand up and use his body to cover the bullets. Is he hoping to touch him in this way, from him? Get some benefits. Codor is smirking and answering, because I am stupid, I don't know what to do in that situation is the most appropriate, so I can only use your body to block bullets for you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
