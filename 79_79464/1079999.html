			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want you to set three standards for storing files. Do you understand? There are three kinds, not letting you make three copies of each file and then damn it. Putting it together in my archives...", Nomi is tempering at her, which is actually a sinister fire. She is taking advantage of the current opportunity to vent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a major executive who is not a third-rate department in the Imperial City, she is undoubtedly the one who has failed. Of course, those who have failed are now in her. Working under the hand, these are actually not a problem. The problem is that she is about to divorce her husband because someone has inserted their marriage, a female watch, a technical woman who has taken her husband, now she is The family has become a joke, a government official who has been defeated by a skilled woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this is not a joke. Women who are skilled are younger and know how to make a man happy. For this reason, they are willing to go against their own wishes. Constantly lying to meet the men they cater to, just like they are standing on the stage, even a piece of clothing does not want to wear hard dance, she can let all onlookers understand her without any touch. It is about to return to the embrace of God. In fact, they are all shit, that is, a liar with a lie, and then take away his husband's heart, which may have something to do with the department that she was transferred to the Information Office, which has no power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't need her anymore, and it's as simple as finding a reason that is lame enough to convince others to abandon her and then make a choice again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young boys and girls in front of them looked very light because of her reprimand, which made her a little more relaxed and passed on her own pressure. Giving someone else, or directly releasing stress by hurting others, is the most efficient option. She walked back and forth a few steps, and continued to reprimand her face. "I finally gave you a reminder. I asked you to make three copies of each file in alphabetical order, number of living areas, and family name. Placed in three different file boxes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the last time I have given you some help in this matter, if you let me I found that you made a mess of these things, and did not go to work there to fall in love, I will let you understand how difficult it is to find a suitable career in the Imperial City, understand?", Nomi squinted The time is still quite scary. At least she used to have some power in the past. These powers made her a very lethal force on certain occasions. "Alice, you stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nomi squatted back to his chair, and the others gradually went out, leaving only a very upset girl. She looks like she is about twenty years old. She looks like a little freckle on her nose and on both sides of her eyes. The word youth is absolutely not suitable for this girl. Looking at the girl's face, Nomi's inner heart is like a viper. She used to have these things. At that time, her husband used her as an angel, but now she is a toilet paper. Was abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I noticed that you are hooking up with two boys in the office, this is not allowed, Alice.", all kinds of anger, Unwillingness and sorrow make Nomi venting out completely so easily. She needs to create more damage and is compensated by the pleasure of this kind of injury. "This is not a school, it can make you feel unscrupulous." It’s like a... It’s a government function, and we have to make sure that our appearance and work order don’t go wrong.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She Not saying the word, sitting on a swing, the woman swaying, this is a very hurtful word, especially if it is said from her mouth. Although she is very keen to tear something up now, this impulse did not stun her mind. She knew that if she said the word, she would soon fall to the bottom of her impressions in her superiors and never get any chance. No one likes a swearing woman running around in front of her, so she skipped the word in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice’s scared tears flowed out, and she realized that she might have to face something, such as being fired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when they join the job, they know that it is strictly forbidden to have any form of office romance in the government department. This is not an unacceptable rule, mainly various types. The authority department involves a lot of power and confidentiality issues. Couples in love have experienced a short period of relaxation after the most wonderful exchange of body fluids in their lives, and may reveal some secrets, regardless of gender. If you can't suppress the urge to fall in love, you can choose one of them to leave the government and go back to a job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the rule is that, in the ages when Alice and the other 20-year-old hormones are shoulder-shouldered with the sun, the control of self is always It is a very troublesome problem because it can't be controlled. It doesn't take much time to build a good feeling into an outbreak and turn it into another kind of emotion. Of course, this is also the most exciting thing in human life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, sir, I...", Alice wants to explain something, but Nomi will not give her this opportunity and directly interrupt her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to be very optimistic about you, I think you will go further, but it turns out that I am wrong in this matter. From...", just When Nomi was going to say her decision, the phone bell suddenly rang, which made Nomi stunned. She glanced at Alice, who kept her head down, and let her breathe a sigh of relief. She was really scared by the phone ring that suddenly sounded, and her face changed. "From tomorrow, you..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone ring that sounded again interrupted her. She frowned and grabbed the receiver. "Here is Nomi...", with the phone On the face of Nomi, Mori's face gradually receded. About three minutes later, she lowered the earpiece with her microphone and glanced at Alice, who was already crying. It was silent for about ten seconds. "This time I Forgive you, but you have to understand Alice, we are very vulnerable in the government sector as a woman. If you find someone to blame you, I think it is more appropriate to change your job."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, put away your tears, go on to work, but be careful, don't hook up with the boys, understand? Go out, close the door. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice wiped her tears 鞠躬Xie out of the room and shut the door, but we also have a huge doubt appear in this world still in the exploratory stage, there is no black and blue fall girl heart. What kind of phone is it that can change the decision of Nomi, is it a good thing? Still something else? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice, who had just left the house, was immediately surrounded by several boys. They were concerned about what happened in the room, but I don’t know why. Suddenly Alice suddenly lost interest in these boys who had some good feelings. She may not realize that she is in such a sudden crisis, in her heart, even where she did not find anything, what kind of seed was buried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, Nomi’s face has a soft smile on her face. She walked to the window and admired the view that was not very nice outside the window, from time to time. Showing a more brilliant smile, "Of course, Kevin, I believe in you, this way, I will pass right away, you will wait a little longer, help me and Mr. Doolin, I will come soon.", after saying these words After that, he should have two sounds. Nomi菈 hangs up the phone. After packing up the things, he makes up a makeup. After checking himself, there is nothing wrong with it. He directly pushes the door out and does not even look at the young people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
