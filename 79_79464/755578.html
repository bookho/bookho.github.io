			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the break, Freena had been squatting around Doolin, and when she was about to leave, she went to the bathroom to make up the makeup, just happened to meet At the end of the toilet, Corinna, both of them stood in front of a huge mirror, holding cosmetics to repair the makeup on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know the young man named Doolin?" Corinna took out her lipstick and wiped out some dull lips. She ate something at night, drank a little wine, and had more lip makeup. Before the banquet is still going on, I can temporarily not make up the makeup. After all, there are too many rich people here. Those rich people don’t care about her actor, but as long as the other person politely picks up the glass, she will definitely cooperate. A fit, the lip print will fall on the cup, very unsightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s going to be gone soon. It’s a rude behavior not to make up the makeup at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena swept her face with a brush, facing Corina’s curiosity, she showed a smile that she thought was the sweetest, “Well. I was a fellow countryman with Du Lin. He used to mix well before. I didn’t expect it to be getting better now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corlina smiles without laughing He snorted. "Is he very good? Or is he rich?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena knew very well what Corinna’s purpose was. The film of Ilyan Holiday is definitely going to be an indelible mark in the history of film. As the first color film, no matter how it is filmed, how the story is, how the performance of the actor is not important, the important thing is that it It is the first. The first color film will inevitably be sought after by fans. If you can leave enough personal color in such a movie that has not yet begun to shoot, it will definitely be good for the future movie star road. Promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of Freina has made Corinna feel a threat. After the scriptwriter modified the script, Freina’s first supporting actress is about to approach the female. The protagonist's play, and Freina's performance is more tense, which has a lot to do with her stage actor's origin, and Corinna can't compare. So Corinna is very worried that her performance in this movie will be worse than Freina. This movie, remembered by the history of the movie, will become the most sinister stain in her life. She needs to be nervous and has a tense reason. Once the audience thinks that the supporting actress’s performance exceeds the heroine, then when the producers and investors consider the actress, they will put Freina on her. Above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also has ambitions. She is looking forward to being able to get rid of the rich who will win her, and not only need a lot of wealth but also a good name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Freya is a little girl and has a relationship with the rich here, plus the natural advantage of the home court, maybe the screenwriter has to change the script, really put Freina's role became another heroine, which is the last thing Corinna wants to see. Want to know how much she can pay for this step today? The scum outside did not know the pain she suffered. If she suffered so much pain, she could not get what she wanted... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thinks she will go crazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since seeing Freena at first glance, Corinna understands that she has met her opponent, Freina is more beautiful, her figure is better, and the tension and level of performance Also higher than her. The only advantage she has now is the damn "fan". If even this is compared to Freena, she doesn't know what to do in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena put the brush up, she didn't apply lip gloss, the pink lips were enough to make anyone's heart move, just rub some natural color lipstick is enough. She smiled and collected her cosmetics and put together her hair. "How do you say that, I don't know if he is very rich...", when Freena personally said this sentence Corinna's smile on her face was softer, and she found that Freina was not so annoying, but the following words made her almost dysfunctional. "But I found that many people respect him and his opinions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the conversation, Freena went out the door, and she did not forget to turn and waved at Corinna. "You are very beautiful tonight, I am not going to live." You, take a break early!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do you live there? There is no doubt that this female watch must be sent meat, this damn stinky girl! When the door of the washroom was closed, Corinna’s lipstick, worth sixty-eight dollars, was stabbed on the washstand by her, and her expression became somewhat distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving the bathroom, Freena took a few steps and smiled a few times. She had already seen this Corinna not pleasing to the eye, since she After entering the crew, I always continually stimulate her, if there is nothing to find her trouble. In fact, she also understands that because this human character has taken away a lot of Corinna’s plays, she certainly won’t have a good face for herself. If it’s not the first color film, it’s the first. Na may not participate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I returned to Doolin, the dinner had already entered the final stage. The things I said were also said. The contact person also contacted. After the speech of Miss Secretary, the dinner was over. When she was about to leave, Freena asked Du Lin’s arm and asked, “Do you have a place to live?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been using honorific words, she Not sure what kind of energy Du Lin has in the city, so be careful not to be wrong. Dooling nodded a bit strangely. He heard that the crew lived on the top 12 floors. The doubts in his eyes were sharply captured by Freina, so he whispered a little about the treatment he encountered in the crew. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, Du Lin can understand that there is no good way for the director or the producer to actually face two actors of this status. It’s a trouble to offend anyone, so you don’t know what to do. You can fight if you love it, as long as you don’t break the progress of filming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he also understands that Freena asked to go to her home to live, not to really want to go to the door, just to let the crew know, Irian It is her home, she is also here to be personal, so that the other actors in the crew attitude towards her. Rennes did not want to let Freina go away immediately. It wasn’t that he wanted to do something for Freina, but Freina knew where he came from and what he used to do. This is very likely It will cause some troublesome things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she left Doolin’s sight, she would like to use the name Doolin to show off. When others ask questions about Doolin, then It is possible to be a clue to the golden robbery. So she said this, Du Lin immediately agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the banquet, I went directly to the hotel’s parking lot from the side door. When Freena saw Doolin’s House, she almost never forgot to close. Your own mouth! Corinna’s pay is not high, her pay is even lower, only eight thousand, and the money is squeezed out from other places. Can look at the front of this luxury car, Freena faint feeling that she seems to have really encountered a bad luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes are more gentle, she knows she may be snobbish, may be a bit "squat", but anyone has been struggling in that environment for more than a decade, It will become what she is now. She just wants to pursue what she thinks is right. No one can point her finger at this issue, even God can't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without hesitation, he sat in the car. The decoration and space in the car was more luxurious than simply looking at the appearance. Du Lin was sandwiched between two women, but his heart was very calm. What is this little scene? In the dream he has seen even more incredible big scenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car did not take any detours, and went straight back to the road to the manor, through the window of Freena looking at the manor on the cliff, showing amazement, She couldn't help but ask, "Is this place not cheap?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has not answered, and Duff, who is sitting on the other side and stays silent for one night, suddenly Opened, "350,000, cash!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;霎The time was in a car, and Freena pressed her hand on her chest, she could feel it. To the heart of his heart violently beating. She knows that such a manor is not too cheap, but 350,000 still exceeds her perception of price limits. Such a manor can buy tens of thousands of pieces in the Tener area, but here... She opened the window a bit, and the sea breeze with the little bit of steam on her face suddenly came to her, giving her a feeling of never before, just like a shower to completely relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smell the salty ripples in the sea breeze, the volatility gradually calmed down, and Freena sighed in a sigh, no longer thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there has been no feeling of being shocked by a series of shocks. When entering the luxurious hall, there is no other strange expression. Doolin makes Duff After Lena arranged a room, she found Jose and Savi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The woman who just came back is also from Tyner, called Freina, who is an actor. She knew me before, I am worried that our business may be Leak, these days, Jose, you are a little busy, you will be with her as a bodyguard, if she wants to disclose to others about me or ask about news about me, stop her. If she does not listen to advice ......", Du Lin touched the hair on the head of Savi's head, "send her to see God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jose nodded dignifiedly. He knows very well that once the news of the Golden Robbery is revealed, the country will not have their place, and they will offend the old and new parties and the central bank of the empire in one breath. When they think about it, they feel terrible. So bold enough to dare to rob the Imperial Bank's treasury and gold? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, Savi does not know the seriousness of the matter, not so nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
