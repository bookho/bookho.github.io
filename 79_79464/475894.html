			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if anyone has asked you, how much will you be willing to take risks? Do something that you know is dangerous and violates morality and law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has ever asked Graf so much, it doesn't matter, because he already has a decision in his heart. The embarrassed life of the past and the happiness that is already in his hands, he knows how to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people have nothing, they don't care about losing and getting, but when a person who doesn't have it, what he fears most is loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on his face gradually disappeared. There were always some unbright eyes flashing in the darkness. He raised his hand and held it down. The police pulled the hand of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has already stepped on the ankle, and most of the body has stepped into the carriage’s police action, looking back at him, with a kind of look in his eyes Can't say the contempt, "How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf took a roll of money from his pocket, this is the pocket money that Du Lin gave him, as a temporary requisition A small compensation for a profit. Graff did not have any complaints, because he himself knew that without Du Lin, he could not play anything. Moreover, this is not a small number, a full hundred yuan. Except for his eating and drinking and looking for a woman, there are probably more than 70 yuan left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the average person of this era, this is almost equal to the money that can be saved in a year. He took the money out of it, and after a few clicks, he suddenly fell into the policeman's pocket and patted it gently, helping the policeman to fold the wrinkles in his pocket. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s so late, the policeman still has to patrol, so hard to eat yet? Is it better to eat something in the front restaurant, warm and warm?" Graf's tone was negotiating and certainly pleasing, but his eyes and what he said were inextricably linked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of Dooling, Graf is a bit silly, a bit stupid, but this does not mean that Graf has no social experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is society? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The society is a giant who is strong and unspeakable. He constantly slaps on everyone's face. When the slap of the society draws the face of everyone, it feels pain. The pain is social experience. Everyone is growing up and squirting, gaining enough social experience to let them try their best to hide when the society raises their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf has social experience, so he handles the accident according to his own understanding, and he thinks it will be useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greed of the police under the dim light is brighter than the street light. He is very clear, and he saw the money in the hands of Graf when he counted the money, at least fifty. Piece. This is the judgment made by his experience. There is at least 50 pieces of money. But these fifty pieces did not satisfy his greed. Graf gave him fifty pieces, and he realized that the things on these horse-drawn carriages could bring more benefits to this big man than definitely fifty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe a few hundred, maybe a few thousand or more. As a policeman, he knows almost all the gray business in the city of Tener. Which tycoon started from what, and which boss had any unclean business under his hand, he could almost say it. It is precisely because of this that he is only moving hands on these horse-drawn carriages, because he does not know these people, they are all new faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not underestimate the power of the rules, whether it is the gang or the police, are obeying the rules that ordinary people can't see. Every time every force uses every means to gain benefits, there are fixed procedures, but this evening is absolutely not normal. No one has informed him that someone is going to deliver goods on this road at night, so he thinks this is a chance. Is he a policeman, defending justice, and stopping crime is not exactly what he should do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Completely got into the carriage of the carriage, the tip of the nose could smell a hint of wine, and the ecstasy on the policeman’s face almost disappeared. Just as he knows the city very well, he also knows the huge profits of private liquor. No need to be much, as long as the goods of this carriage are returned to him, he immediately left the city without any problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in order to be on the safe side, he decided to open a box, after all, in addition to private wine, there is a low wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the squeeze of the batons, the wooden shelf made an unpleasant twist, his hands almost trembled and took a bottle of wine, then Unscrew the lid and fill it, the whole face instantly reddish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the policeman decided to eat the goods, Graf made a decision, a very difficult decision. Because the carriages stopped, the little guys behind came back. Graf raised his head and looked at another policeman who was smoking in the coachman's position. Several teenagers nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Graf pulled the dagger from behind his back and stepped on his ankle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Morris was killed, he understood that he might have embarked on another path, and one day he had to face such a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he does not regret it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage was shaken a few times with Graf’s boarding, and the ecstatic policeman jerked back and just wanted to intimidate this big man. Swallow this lot of goods. The next second, his words have not yet come to say, a sharp dagger inserted in his eyes, and stirred up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf quickly stepped forward, hugged the soft policeman, and quietly put him aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the car, the policeman holding the brake handle of the carriage smoked and looked at the fine goods in the side cabinets, not knowing what to think. After the last sip, he threw the cigarette butt on the floor, glanced down at him, stepped on the foot and rolled it. When he looked up again, he found that his side was already surrounded by six or seven and a half teenagers. These teenagers are a bit sullen, with fierce eyes in their eyes, just like when he goes home every night to greet his dog at home, his eyes are green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was already aware that it was wrong, and when they went to the pistol on the belt, the teenagers suddenly squeezed. They were tightly crowded together, and the smoking policeman’s movements to reach the belt also slowed down. His gaze slowly descended from the face of a sly teenager in front of him, looking down at his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three daggers, all inserted in, there is no blade, and two of them are crazyly twisting. He didn't feel much pain at this time. When the body suddenly became injured, there was an overreaction, and the short-term closed pain was transmitted. The fear in his eyes rushed away from what the previous child couldn't say. When he opened his mouth and wanted to scream, a teenager immediately grabbed his mouth, while another teenager twitched his knife and inserted it into his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less than ten seconds in the whole process, the policeman entered the carriage of the carriage with the support of two or three teenagers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf’s eyes were full of excitement, and he took the dagger out of the policeman’s eyes and wiped it on his clean police uniform. Rub, then take the money out of his pocket. He took a sip of water and inserted the dagger back into the sheath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtain was opened at this time, he glanced and immediately greeted him and dragged another "sleeping" policeman, and the carriage slowed again. Slowly moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to some less obvious blood on the ground, even if there are witnesses, they don’t necessarily dare to say anything and dare to do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of people even dare to kill the police, do not dare to kill an ordinary person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the dim light of the streetlights, the three carriages gradually disappeared into the night behind the intersection, just as they did not stay here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, a frightened passer-by peeped his head out of the dark alley, looking at the place where the carriage disappeared, and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is just an ordinary tramp, he does not want to cause trouble, so he decided to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he quickly left in the opposite direction, he accidentally bumped into a passerby because of fear and panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there are not many pedestrians on the road in the city of Tener, not to mention that it is not a bustling section. After eight o'clock every day, the pedestrians on the road are almost at hand. number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He apologized, and looked up, his heart was shaking, and he was a group of half-sized young people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man headed with a cap and a windbreaker, and the open windbreaker is a plaid sweater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Walk a little attention!", the young man said to him, he nodded again and again, the young man seemed to think of something, took out a pocket A banknote of a denomination of money was tucked into the pocket of his shirt. "The weather is getting colder and colder, buy some winter clothes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
