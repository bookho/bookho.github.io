			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is considering whether to talk to Magus. When he walks up the upper level, Xiu En is depressed and experiences the wandering of his life. Han life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that Du Lin had seen him after a simple investigation, or he took him to the past to give him a job, or he didn’t know what to do. go away. But now the situation is Du Lin, and none of the people including Du Lin use any means to contact him. It seems that Du Lin has forgotten who he is, or that Du Lin simply does not want to pull him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is actually the best, at least not to be sacrificed by Du Lin and sent to prison by the investigation team to make a choice. After all, he worked hard and followed the requirements of the investigation team. Now Du Lin does not choose him, not he does not cooperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that although Du Lin did not send someone to contact him, those who are stalking are still there, then he has to behave like a tramp. If you reveal a flaw, you may have a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it really made him very embarrassed during this time, and when he got up every morning, he felt like he was staying in hell for a night. Although there are some agents in the military office in the wanderers around, there are some who are really tramps. These tramps are not like a well-educated gentleman, they need to find a bathroom when they need convenience, or stay away from the crowd. As long as the guys need to be excreted, they can solve the problem by taking two steps to find a grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no big problem when the weather is cold, but now it is almost summer, and the odor of the urine is evaporating faster in a high temperature environment. Every day, from morning till night, there is such a disgusting taste. In addition to the feces of dogs, cats and other pets, long-term not taking a bath and not smelling the smell of clothes, it is like a hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that those who are stalking, Dolin wants to stretch his hand, or just want someone to stare at himself, no Let yourself trouble him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schoen feels that the latter is more likely, even if he does not want to admit it, he has to admit that the gap between him and Du Lin is now incalculable. In particular, after he briefly read the files about Du Lin, an inexplicable sense of defeat in his heart came to life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the starting point, he did not know how many times higher than Du Lin’s starting point. When he was young, he was elected to the Imperial Police Investigation Bureau as a detective with very good results, and he also got a very good boss. What is Doolin? A farmer's son, a poor and white poor boy, has no money, no status, no connections, nothing. Even if he was taken to Tener, he was also a member of the investigation bureau of the Tener area, and he maintained a very good relationship with the local police station and the investigation bureau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin? However, it was a hawker who sold private liquor. At that time, he wanted to pinch Dulin, just as simple as pinching a bug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t want to admit defeat, but he can’t admit defeat, he has to comfort himself. There are few people like Du Lin, and not everyone can go all the way to the top. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agent hidden in the tramp when he got up in the morning told him that Dulin’s man was still staring at him, he had to go to work. Xiu'en's mouth was pumped, and she reluctantly put on her slightly clean clothes and went to work with the guy who was eating. His work is begging. People who become tramps may have various reasons, but they all have a certain relationship with laziness. For lazy people, sitting on the ground and waiting for others to throw money into their little washbasin is the best job for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At nine o'clock in the morning, Xiu En came to the station. He looked for a slightly shaded place and put the things he was eating on the ground. One tells me how poorly cardboard, a blackened white cloth, and a pitted washbasin. After putting things all together, he began to close his eyes and raise his spirits. It was not that he didn't want to do anything, but he was really faceless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He worked at the Imperial Capital for a while and met some people. If he was seen by those friends, he would be finished in his life, and the explanations were unclear. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in the morning, the leisure time is about to pass, and when Xiu En is about to fall asleep and is about to fall asleep, a "study" with doubts and surprises He pulled back from the stupidity. He opened his eyes and saw a beautiful girl standing in front of him. The girl's expression had a feeling of not being able to come up. At this time, Xien's brain was blown up, and he wanted to go, but he could not move his legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This girl is his ex-girlfriend. After he was in jail, there was no contact, and naturally he became an ex-girlfriend. She is also a detective of the General Directorate of Investigation. In the same year, Xien entered the General Administration of Investigation in the same batch, and faced a lot of pressure in working in such a place. The unfamiliarity of the business makes them often screamed by the team leader who led the team. Over time, they are comforted and encouraged by each other. They feel good and finally come together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people bless them and think that they can go on until they step into the marriage hall and become husband and wife. However, no one thought that in the process of arresting, the criminal suspects gave a small book to Xiu En and then committed suicide by shooting. This little book has changed the life of Xien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small book records the names of some people and their current work, and when and where, suicides gave them how much. This is a book, a bribe book used to bribe government officials. After returning to the investigation bureau, he copied the account book and handed it over to his boss. His immediate boss asked him not to investigate the case and sealed the original account book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desire to make a big case is not obedient. He began to quietly investigate the officials on the books, but his slightly younger investigations. The means were quickly discovered and reported to the cabinet. According to the current law of the empire, no one is allowed to investigate or monitor incumbent officials until they have left the office without the permission of the cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shen has apparently violated this statute, and because of his naive behavior, some people can go unpunished! According to the laws of the empire, in violation of the evidence obtained by the evidence law without permission, it cannot appear in court as valid evidence, and the evidence will never expire. That is to say, because he re-enacted a book and investigated several people on the account book, he indirectly let these people get rid of the law they had violated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as these people do not sin in the future, or are not caught after the crime, then their previous duty crimes can not be prosecuted as direct charges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these two things, the deputy director of the General Administration, Lei Wei, issued a large number of officials on the ledger, and finally, due to misconduct and professional discipline. I was taken away by Tyner to grow flowers and grass, and separated from my girlfriend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later he became the director of the RCA, the director of the contraband investigation bureau, and contacted his girlfriend once, he excitedly told the girl, can’t How long will he be able to transfer back to the General Directorate of the Royal Capital. However, it is a pity that the girl soon received news that Xiu En was sued for a number of crimes such as duty crimes, and he was sentenced to five years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many years, I will meet again with my ex-girlfriend, one is a beggar begging, and the other is a senior detective of the General Directorate of the Police Investigation, except for sighing and making people In addition, there seems to be no better language to describe the inner feelings at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four eyes are opposite, Xiu En wants to tell the girl that she is actually acting now, but he can't say it. The two looked at each other for a moment, thought they would say something, or when something happened, a tall and handsome man came out of the station, naturally holding the girl’s waist and buried in the girl’s side. Deeply smelling the smell of the girl, "What's the matter, what's so good?" From his actions and her resistance, it can be seen that their relationship is very close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl smiled and shook her head gently. "Just think this person is so pitiful, so I watched it for a while.", girl from her own bag I took out twenty dollars and knelt it down into the small washbasin of Xiu'en. The thousand words in Xiu'en's heart cooled in this moment. His expression became numb, and he said a thank you, then looked down at his hands and his head was blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall, handsome man glanced at the cardboard in front of Xiu En and pulled the girl away from here. "You won't see it, that's a The story is deceptive. It is to get the attention of the girls who love you so much, so you can swindle money from your hands. The next time you see this kind of person pretending not to see it, you don’t know how to find it. A job to change life, just thinking about begging for life, in our society, because there is too much garbage, it makes some people feel that society has changed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Know, I will bypass it next time!", said the girl added, "But he is really pitiful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The tall, handsome man licked the girl’s head and smiled politely. “I really can’t help you...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation between them Still introduced into the ears of Xien, his hands suddenly clenched into fists, and an indescribable thing was tearing his heart. He felt almost unable to breathe. That kind of pain, that kind of frustration, the power that wants to prove what makes him crazy. He glanced at the twenty dollars in the washbasin, smashed it up, then kicked the washbasin and his "street" and strode toward a boy across the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy who was in charge of the surveillance of the grace saw that Shane ran towards himself, and when he was about to leave, he was pressed by his hand on his shoulder. Xiuen gasped and her eyes were covered with bloodshot eyes. I don't know if it was because of the angle. There was a green aperture on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
