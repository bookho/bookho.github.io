			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very bad now, I don't know what to say, in short, it is beyond everyone's expectations, this is now a big problem!", Harry The mood is a bit low, and there is something dissatisfied in the tone. In fact, the situation is more serious than what he described. It can be said that his future of infinite scenery is likely to be ruined because of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a joke, it is really very troublesome, he always feels that someone is behind himself, and he has even pointed this finger at something he is very familiar with and lives in. The high person, although he did not tell others his own guess, but he thinks that Magus has definitely intervened in this matter, and is not the kind of intervention to help him intervene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not very concerned about this situation, and he does not understand the specifics. He asked directly, "I understand, we are friends, you Please tell me what you need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Harry only spit out a word, money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the exposure of the accepted bribes that need to be returned to others, the most terrible thing is the unfinished project. He received hundreds of thousands of dollars to unilaterally terminate the unfinished project and then gave it to another contractor. Another contractor built a luxury shopping mall very quickly. Anyway, it was the kind of money that was mad, and there was a thick smell of money from the inside out. This shopping mall has become a landmark building, and the traffic is also very good, a large number of luxury brands gathered here, attracting a lot of wealthy customers to patronize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of the unfinished project suddenly came back with a lot of money. They have disappeared for a while, now they say that it is not a donation. Instead, go and raise more funds. However, when they raised enough funds, they found that their own land became a thing of others. The buildings that had been built a small part and half were completely overthrown and disappeared. Now this group is holding Harry to collect bribes to harm the interests of legitimate businessmen, biting him desperately. Then someone was exposed to what kind of bribes Harry had ever collected and what did not do the rules and laws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other things are trivial, lose a little money, lose more money, but this group is a big lion. They actually want to tear off a piece of meat from Harry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The addition of the Anti-Criminal Crime Investigation Bureau and the Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Supreme Court also made it a bit more troublesome. Just a few days before Doolin’s return, the Supreme Court opened a punitive fine for Harry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a noun here called "punitive penalty." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a simple example, for example, if someone hits a punch for any reason, others sew a few stitches. According to the normal compensation process, the final decision only needs to pay ten. The money is enough. However, the judge feels that your performance, or the purpose of the attack, is too contemptuous of social order and law, or that in the course of the trial, all sorts of sophistry is very arrogant or has caused some bad influence. Originally, you only need to pay the final compensation of ten dollars. The nature of punishment and punishment will let you know how terrible your mistakes are, so you may need to pay one hundred, one thousand or more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This depends on the judge’s mood, maybe a little less, but it may be a little more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can express my opinion on this final resolution. After the hearing, everyone feels that there is nothing wrong with this, and they will continue to implement it. If you feel that the judge has too much personal feeling in sentencing, then reduce it a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time inside is a punitive fine, up to 15 million. Among them, he really needs compensation of only three or four million. Others are trying to punish him for obstructing the investigation team during the investigation and evidence collection, and attempting to interfere with the final resolution through illegal means. Therefore, there is such a high-priced fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the resolution came out, Harry had a faint guess. Someone wanted to engage him, and Marggs also participated. If there is no Magnus nod, even the life-long judge will not issue such a fine for the violation, even if it is punitive, it will not exceed twice the price. Some things don't need to be said clearly. Everyone knows very well that there is a charter about what people do and how to deal with them. Now this set has failed on him, even if Magus did not take the initiative, he stood by and watched him unlucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money in his pocket is not enough now. If you follow the family-owned industry and the wealth in his hands, there are a lot of 15 million. Nor can't afford it. The problem is that he is not a homeowner, he is a man, and secondly, a considerable part of his wealth is used for his campaign in the election year after eight months. In a strict sense, this money is not his personal property. It belongs to the campaign fund under the name of the campaign office. Once the money is used, and there is no money when the election is not held, the new lawsuit alone will enable him. Continue to be troubled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now the best way is to find some money from other places, fill in the current hole, once the election is successful, he has a way to return the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who can now take out so much money in one go, except for the bank and the aristocrats who have been watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are good friends, right? I will give you the money after the election. If you can stage it, it will be better. You want Believe me, after I got that position, you got much more than you paid today!", Harry repeatedly promised and hinted that the value of the money is not only reflected in the medium of banknotes, but also Policy and more far-reaching influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is true, as long as he can really go that step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s mouth is a little pick, he actually feels very happy. When Harry wanted to control his thoughts and wanted to manipulate him, there were some minor conflicts. At that time, Du Lin decided to hang him. Now that the results have come out, he is really unlucky. At the same time, Dooling also had a new speculation. After he came into contact with more things, he had a feeling of faintness. Harry might not be the successor of Maggs, he might just be a target that was thrown to attract firepower. In terms of acting style and governance philosophy, Harry and Magus are not a type of person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry’s attitude towards capital is completely different from that of Maggs. He often appears in public with some big capitalists, and there are many in his campaign. The support funds come from a number of anonymous accounts, which are undoubtedly secret accounts of his capitalist supporters. Once Harry came to power, how can he return these people to those who support him? There is no doubt that the development of new rules of the game and policy tilt, but this just undermines Magus's constant vigilance and preparedness against capital forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Dulin thought this might be a silent compromise between Maggs and the capital. He could do it without Harry, for example, right. Capital forces adopt a high-pressure policy. He can't sit in this position forever, and he will inevitably need a slightly neutral person to reconcile contradictions, so that the society will not be turbulent after the emergence of new successors. But now, Du Lin thinks that Magus may not really like Harry. This time, Harry has encountered such a big trouble. Magus has not lend a helping hand. Keeping your attitude is proof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Du Lin felt that Harry had become a deserted child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to lend money to Harry after considering it. When you want someone to fall into the abyss, don’t push him, but let him carry more Heavy burden, he will slowly fall into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin agreed to borrow money to make Harry very happy, and all the words were revealed that Du Lin was his true good friend, and he could see that he seemed to be from someone else. Borrowing money is not so smooth, otherwise it will not be so happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have fallen into a desperate situation now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to Du Lin for being able to lend a helping hand during this special period, Harry invites Doolin to come to him. He must be good. Entertain Dulin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hanging up the phone, these things will be solved by the people who have the door-to-door service. At the current level of Doolin, there is no need to go to the bank for business, banking. The person will take the initiative when he has time to help him through all the formalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the villa for a short break, Dove told Du Lin that a gentleman named "Schoen" had been waiting for him for a long time. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s said that Xiu’en is also the kind of bloody mold. He was finally released from prison and was stared by the people of the Security Committee and the Military Intelligence Office. He became a pawn into the side of Doolin. After a complicated ideological struggle, Xiu En agreed, and also received the promise of Doolin. The result was more than half a year. In the past six months or so, Du Lin did not arrange for him to do anything, even if he did not include him in the personnel system, naturally he would not have a wage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current site of Doolin in the west, Xiu En actually mixed up the need to find a few part-time jobs to maintain life, the official did not dare to directly repair En money, it may be exposed, only to watch him busy all day long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Du Lin is finally back, and Xien can also come in handy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a woman’s request, which appeared outside the villa of Doolin at three o'clock in the afternoon. The reason is three o'clock, it is because Du Lin There will be a lunch break, the length of time will be uncertain, and it will take up to three at the latest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
