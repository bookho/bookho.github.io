			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Doolin came to the Federation, the Border Agency discovered a wave of smuggling, and they have seized more than a dozen illegal immigrants. It may be the sum of the number of people smuggling in a month, but now it is only the number of people found in a few days, and many others have not found it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number and number of smugglings during this time period are much higher than ever before. What does this mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewing what happened in this month, except for the end of the relationship between the two currencies, it seems that only Du Lin came to the federation and the Empire has a direct relationship. Does this mean that the birth of these peaks of smuggling may have a certain relationship with Doolin to the Union? To this end, the Border Authority sent an unusual smuggling incident to the upper-level Federal Homeland Security Administration. The department chief responsible for the anti-organizational crimes received the news and asked the following agents to "warn" Doolin to let him recognize one. Reality - here is the federation, not the empire, there is no soil for him to breed, and he is not welcome to do things here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation is a very developed business society that has completed the transformation of feudalism into capitalist society earlier than any other country in the world, the magic of money. Here is the best expression. Although they don't like the heads of criminal groups like Du Lin to come here, they can't refuse the money-related people who want to enter the country. The only way is to prevent crime and tell him that he has been closely watched by the authorities. Any unfriendly act will have serious consequences, so that he will consider the cost of crime and choose to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an uncomplicated thing for the top management, but for the underlying executives, this is very complicated, very, very complicated. It is also very difficult to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that Doolin is the leader of a criminal group, although so far there is no decisive evidence to testify this, and he is a very rich The leader of the interest group is not only himself, but the members around him are also rich people. Then the question is coming. How can "warning" him to achieve the effect that the authorities hope to achieve? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a subtle way? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may not do anything, but it will make Du Lin feel that the federal security department is a soft egg, so that his confidence will swell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a stern warning? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now is the situation that these two senior agents have to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gang, even the leader of the power is not terrible, the terrible thing is that this person is not only bad, but also has money and power. In one sentence, Dooling took their actions to the height of international diplomacy. There is no doubt that if the Imperial Embassy protests to the Foreign Ministry and the Joint Council, their chiefs must be trained, but they are responsible for the implementation. People must be finished. Being suspended can be said to be the best result. It is very likely that they will be expelled and investigated. At that time, in the federal society, in addition to being a bodyguard for some people, there is basically no way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal is a very real interest society, it is difficult for people with taint to find a better job, then everyone, especially those who are rich Are you good people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all, the bad things that the big men have done are not necessarily much less than the bottom gangs, but people can understand and even forgive those big men who have done it. Things because they have money! Rich people can not only be forgiven by people, but also worthy of blessings for them. This is the charm of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s attitude is much tougher than they think. It can be said that Du Lin simply did not put them in the eye. This is a very irritating thing, but they have to bear it. Dooling did not give them the opportunity to explain them directly. Two senior agents left the back of the manor and could only shake their heads and smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them said, "You shouldn’t ask him that, if it were me, I would be angry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has not shown such a tough attitude and strong aggression when they first entered the house. When they talked about the recent surge of people from the Empire to the Federation, there has been a surge of warnings and implicit warnings. Do not let Du Lin break out after doing things in the federal territory. They are saying that these stowaways are all Dulin people. He is premeditating a big thing. Now the federal authorities already know that he is better off doing nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person smiled twice. "Don't we go in and tell him to welcome him to the federal investment? We all know what he is doing, even though we are now Dashing away, but our purpose has been achieved, this is good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threatening intimidation in the process of crime prevention, or fraud is a very effective means. When the criminals who are premeditated are threatened and deceived, they will think that their plans have been exposed and choose to suspend the plan. This set of methods has prevented many criminal cases and extended many new things. The most famous one is "whether the impulse of not producing actual criminal acts constitutes a criminal standard." The initiators of this set of thoughts believe that the criminals have caused losses after committing criminal acts, and even if they are arrested, they cannot recover the losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, if the criminal arrests him before committing his crimes, does it really avoid the loss? Of course, this kind of thinking is still under discussion. Many people think that if they do not commit crimes, then it is not a crime. Everyone will have a lot of impulses. It can't be turned into a criminal because of impulsiveness. This is not in line with the standard of definition of crime by law and social morality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After closing the door, Du Lin licked his temple. He asked, "Is there any abnormality in Albert recently?", he feels the land of the federation It is no coincidence that the Security Bureau is looking for him. The so-called surge in the number of illegal immigrants is only an excuse. It must be that some aspects may have leaked some secrets, which has aroused the attention of the federal government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha shook his head, and he did Dolin’s grabbing a bite of an apple in the fruit basket, and the crisp tearing sound made people feel the apple. The freshness of his life, "his recent life is very monotonous, going to work, getting off work, sleeping. Besides he will go to a social event on Wednesday afternoon, he has barely been in contact with others."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin asked, "Do you think this is normal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Normal?", they all laughed, " Of course not normal, he is pretending to be himself, he must have done something, so he needs to show innocent look now, what are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin hands The tenth of the chin is against the chin, and the soft scorpion has some slaps and some comfort. "Control him and don't alarm other people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is A very important node, from the perspective of those who have been monitoring Du Lin, Du Lin seems to have done nothing. Has been sitting a lot, he was released by remote command a lot of news out. The frenetic federal financial market has caused people to lose all their sensibility. The birth of every wealth myth has become ordinary, and even every participant has played a special role in this wealth myth. They are all winners, winners, and each of them is making money crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the problem arises. If everyone makes money, where does the money come from? The money can not appear out of nowhere for no reason, even if it is printing, it needs enough credibility to support the money that suddenly comes out, so if someone makes money, someone will lose money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone’s eyes are focused on how to make money and how much money they make, they will subconsciously ignore the hapless people who are being overwhelmed by this wave. I also neglected that the profits I got were from the bodies of these losers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin needs to unscrew a few faucets for the wave that has begun to become dangerous and is about to form a tsunami. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day, the front page of "Good Morning Po" published a piece of news, and the joint construction will be fully responsible for the railway project running through the North Continent, from the Arctic Icefield and Beginning at the junction of the Western Continent, the entire northern road will be laid at the southernmost tip of the Saruye (state), and then the construction of the submarine tunnel will begin, and a tunnel connecting the eastern continent will be dug along the continental shelf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of this news means that the joint construction and its parent company Atlantic consortium will go further, not only the joint construction of the stock price began to show a significant rise, The stock prices of all listed companies under the Atlantic Group have begun to rise significantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current joint construction has been called a barometer of the industrial sector, and the entire industrial sector has once again become a new tipping point, with a large amount of funds beginning to converge in the industrial sector. In the middle, even the Federal Economic and Trade Index has obviously increased before the close, and a new round of market is ready to go! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert sat in the car with a briefcase. He said that he went home and closed the door. The car started slowly and the door was locked. . He tore the tie that tore the neckline, a little breathless. He frowned, and the joint construction project unilaterally announced the news without reporting to him, making him feel that another hand began to intervene in the operation of the entire group company without his knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He chatted with Jindun’s people on Wednesday, and the other party was willing to accept him as a member of Golden Shield, and introduced him to the heavyweight society in Golden Shield. member. These people are representatives or heads of major consortia. Albert wants to talk to them and see if there is any way to make his current situation better, such as stopping Doolin's plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
