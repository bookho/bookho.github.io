			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think Abigail will not cooperate with us? I think this guy is very good at speaking. The tribes are very positive about him and should not "Where?" Buddha closed the door and went to the sofa and sat down. He took an apple from the fruit bowl on the table and took a bite. This guy has a soft spot for Apple. As long as he can see the apple, he I must definitely get a pick up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. After the bank robbery, his relationship with these brothers was closer, and naturally there is nothing to say. He looked at the incense of the apples and the apples. He also caught one in his hand. "He seems to be very good at speaking and he has no opinion, but you need to consider his identity and status. You said that he is a representative of the local people. How can a representative of a ethnic group be so arrogant? If it is not that he wants to leave here as soon as possible, it means that he is only a beggar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If he If you are an embarrassed person, then in the face of such an opportunity, he will definitely join us without hesitation, so as to get rid of his embarrassing identity. But he did not, this is equivalent to telling me that he refused me. When it came to this, Du Lin laughed. He took a sip of the apple. The fruit juice was fried from the flesh during the chewing process. The sweet taste really made people shine. He said while holding the apple. "He may feel that he has become less important after joining the fellowship, so he chose to avoid it in order to protect his personal rights. This is shameful, do you know? Personal interests make it impossible for a group to stand up. This is a sin! If it was before, his behavior was to betray the country and betray the people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Du Lin suddenly stopped. He placed half of the apple on the table, and he was seated. He looked straight at the Buddha and looked at the Buddha's gaze. "All Buddha, my brother, you believe me." Can you lead all the people and walk out a different way? Do you believe that I can lead everyone and stand on the wave of this era to make our own voice to the world?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha also became serious. He clicked hard. "I believe, I always believe, I firmly believe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Du Lin smiled and leaned on the sofa, revealing a playful expression. "Let our stormtroopers clear all the obstacles that hinder the rise of our race! This is your glory, but also belongs to Savi’s glory, one day we will stand on the Parliament Hill All the evidence we walked the streets, by then we will see everything we do is very correct "<br <br /> & nbsp />;! & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Du Lin has already made a decision, and Abigail has just come down from the house that is eye-catching and dazzling in the sun. Residents living in the Fifth Administrative Region have stopped and looked at the luxury car and Abien from the luxury car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city has seven administrative districts, each with different laws and different urban planning. In remote locations and underdeveloped regions, cities are basically crowded together and lack adequate planning and design. However, great efforts have been made in the planning and design of cities in developed regions to ensure the balance of each class and every industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first administrative district is the most beautiful and prosperous area on the coastline. It is home to the rich, the city that never sleeps, and the commercial center and heart of the city. The second administrative district is where the successful people in the mainstream society live. There are many companies gathered here, and the working atmosphere is stronger than the first administrative district. The third administrative district to the fifth administrative district are the middle and lower levels of residence. There are some hand workshops and factories with no pollution. The sixth administrative district and the seventh administrative district are like another city, 20 kilometers away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are agglomerations of heavily polluting factories, factories that make huge noises, and many "volunteer groups" of tramps and babies. The city will take care of these “garbage” and send it to volunteer labor every day. They will give them enough food and “labor costs” of five yuan a month. They will be here for a lifetime, or be sent to the wild as a more useless "scum" to fend for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a concise division may be a class of crushing fruit in some people’s eyes, but for this era, this society is indeed The best way to divide. By separating each class, it is possible to avoid contradictions between classes. The poor are always with the poor. The contradiction between them is only an internal contradiction. Even if the dog's brain is played, it is a matter between the poor and the poor. It will never become a class contradiction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abien and the vast majority of Guarts live in the Fifth District, or the Fifth District. The biggest ideal for people living here is to find a better job, make more money, then buy a house in the fourth district and take the family with them. There are better medical resources, better educational resources, a better living environment, and even better job opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desire of these people for wealth is beyond the imagination of the residents of the previous four districts, so when Abigail came down from the luxury car, everyone His eyes are focused on him. When some people saw his face clearly, they left a dark sentence. They thought that they were rich, and they wanted to make a knot. They didn't expect the people who got off the bus to be like poor people. But some Guarts have gone around and wondered if something happened, is there any good thing waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the compatriots who were surrounded, Abigail shook his head in a quiet voice. "There is a respected gentleman who wants to consult a little thing. I know something about it, so after he finished speaking, he sent the car back to me... well. Well, go back and do your own thing. If there is anything good, I will definitely inform you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of people’s understanding of Abid, there is no Considering that he is lying, he has left. Abien looked calm and returned home. The gentle wife opened the door for him. When he was just about to ask him what to eat at night, he punched his face with a punch. His wife closed her mouth in fear and prevented herself from making a small noise. Abien vented some of his anger as he did with a sandbag, and gradually stopped his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled up the wilted wife on the ground, slaps the dust on her body, and then takes two dollars out of his pocket and puts it into her hands. "Get some chicken back at night and call me." He is very sensible and doesn't start on his wife's face. It will make people discover that he is not a good person that he shows to everyone, every time. When there is something that doesn't go well, she will take her wife out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife also wanted to resist, but Abigail told her that if she told the outside person that he beat her, then he would tell Others she carried him and other men to sneak, so he would beat her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a situation, his wife can only endure. Fortunately, Abigail is very restrained even when he is venting his anger, except that his wife is in pain. In addition, his wife has not yet reached the level where she needs to go to the hospital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this is not his intention, or it may be that his combat power is only so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body under the woman’s clothes trembled, pouting, tidying up her hair and holding the wall away from home. Abbey went to the second floor of the room and sat on the table. He looked at the charter that he had thrown up and the anger of the stock rose again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone wants to undermine his position in the Guars, it is unforgivable! He has been in possession for more than a decade to have the status of today. Do you want to take it away? His face was a little twisted, holding a paper knife and inserting it firmly into the thin charter, tearing it hard and cutting it hard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two couples at dinner, they have three children, the boss is in college in other cities, and the other two are not in Irian. This is a tourist city. The level of education can only be said to be general. People with a little ability are willing to send their children to other places to go to school instead of studying "tourism majors" here. It may be in some people's eyes that the travel profession is also a very good knowledge. Once you graduate, you can find a job, but Abbie feels that his child should have more ambitious goals and ideals and cannot be restricted to a small Erie. Ancheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
