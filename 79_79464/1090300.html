			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is Doolin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The familiar voice of Natiya came from the receiver I don't know why, at this moment, her uneasy feelings were quickly calmed down. She even had a little bit of laughter. She didn't call Du Lin before. She didn't want to borrow money from the boss before she started to work. This is not a good phenomenon. She doesn't know what Du Lin will think. she was. So she avoided this as much as possible. Mr. Gabriel’s step by step forced her to have no way. Anyone who suddenly had more than 90,000 yuan in debt was a scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After raising it for so long, it is impossible to raise enough money. Those friends and past colleagues always show off their wealth all the time, when she really needs When they help, these people have their heads back. This is no way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in addition to this factor, there is another layer that she has some inconvenience and the reason that Du Lin said, that is, in the dinner, Ange Rio forced her to do something. She even agreed to do the psychological preparations for exchanging body fluids after Duoling back at night, which made her feel a little uncomfortable, just like...what they had done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two conditions proposed by Geblin, regardless of which one, have stabilized her. No matter which plan she chooses, she will eventually lose a lot of money, far more than the debt owed by Walter. Now, she has nowhere to go. In addition to trying to contact Du Lin, she simply does not know who to look for to borrow money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am...", she glanced at the hidden door, and walked back to the window, facing the window, the sun was thick outside the window. The summer of the world is full of vitality, and her mood is better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter? My butler said that your mood just sounded a bit less stable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes a sentence can hurt people invisible, but there is also a sentence that can make the winter melt, Natiya's mouth is slightly picking, she changed position again, "I am a little trouble now, financial trouble, I I have thought of a lot of ways. In the end, I can only call you with the idea of ​​trying it out." She said it very clearly when she came up. At this time, if it is said to cover up, it will breed a lot of unnecessary. The problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was dumbfounded. He sat up and took a drink with a drink. "The problem that can be solved with money is never a problem. If I can, can I ask why?" He paused and explained. One sentence, "I don't want to explore your personal privacy. If you have other troubles, I can solve it for you. You know, sometimes some people say that I am bad, and that I am a bad person. The bad guys have a unique experience for many things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya chuckled twice, she thought it was very interesting to talk to Du Lin because Du Lin always There are some unexpected little humors. These little humors can get the best of others. "My husband, Walter, you know, he owes some money. Now the creditor is coming to the door. I will not take it for the time being." "So much money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, you leave an address for me, and after a while I will be able to pass."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hanging up the phone, Natiya heart Some moved, good mood again. But the moment she hangs up, she suddenly realizes that she just forgot to tell Du Lin how much she needed to pay Mr. Geblin, and she was happy. When I mentioned the phone, I wanted to give Du Lin another pass, but my hand did not wave the turntable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, it should be able to solve it. In short, as long as Du Lin’s people come, they can always get money before they leave work. She is not willing to call Du Lin in a row. The big guys like Du Lin are definitely very busy every day, and there are many jobs to be dealt with. You shouldn't bother him any more. When you communicate with the people he sent, you should be able to solve it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gatia Lin is talking quietly with his lawyer when he returns to the living room. He is also a busy man, and there are many things he needs. Handle it yourself. A senior hacker like him is actually not so good. In the handling of interpersonal relationships, there are often many messy things. They are discussing some small things about land acquisition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw Natiya coming out of the room, the two stopped talking, and Gabriin re-sitting and looking at Natiya, "Ms., now Have you made your choice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya has a sigh of relief, and her attitude has undergone subtle changes. She sits in Gabriel’s Opposite, looking straight into his eyes, nodded and said, "Yes, someone will send the money later, you wait a little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geblin frowned. He actually wanted the house more than 90,000 pieces of cash. In addition to the value of the house itself, the decoration and the furniture, electrical appliances and other things inside can also be worth one or two thousand pieces, and the value of the villa is not just the value of wealth. Now that "Anti-Crime Crime" began to be implemented within the Empire, a newly formed department specializes in the crackdown and investigation of duty crimes, making many cash transactions troublesome. However, if you send the villa, it will not become so troublesome. If the property rights remain unchanged, let others live here, and no one can find any illegal places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even if you don’t say this, you can earn more money by selling to those who want to squeeze into the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Natiya for a while and was silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time passed by, the two did not have any communication. After about twenty minutes, the door of the house was knocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natiya slammed the door and opened the door. Two very young people stood outside the door and looked like they were only in their twenties. They wear very well-dressed clothes, and the accessories are very particular, which always gives Natiya an uncoordinated feeling. She can't say where it is wrong, but these two people have a less normal temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you Ms. Natiya?", Natiya nodded. The young man pushed the door forward two steps and smiled and reached out. Mr. Doolin asked me to come. He said that you need help. You can call me Tolan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya shook hands with him, "Hello. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolan has some handsome, plus the support of clothes and accessories to make him more handsome, his face with a sunny smile, toward Na Tia took a look behind him and asked, "Is the trouble still inside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya hesitated inexplicably, then clicked Nod, "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then the next thing will be handed over to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Three people entered the living room, Gabrin looked at the two young people and still sat on the sofa, he did not need to show his respect to any young people, this is not his bluff, the big guys he has seen are younger than these Ordinary person Need to make more, they need to show respect is the attitude of people. But I don't know why, from the two young people, Geblin felt a bit of something he was very disgusted with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must be a trouble man!" Tolan smiled and walked over and took the initiative to reach out to Gabriel. "I am Tolan. The purpose of my coming here is to solve the trouble. If I don't mind, can I tell?" Where is the problem now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not say how much he needed to bring the phone to Tolan at the time, only told Tolan Need to go to a place to solve some trouble for a woman named Natiya, so Tolan immediately came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolan is an agent in Sterley. His style is very similar to that of Doolin. He dares to fight and dare to attack, dare to challenge authority, and dare to destroy the rules. Du Lin directly promoted him. At that time, Du Lin needed every city to have a "model". This model needed a lot of energy, and there was enough intelligence. Tolan quickly stood out in the agent system and became the youngest. One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More interesting is that although Tolan has become an agent, he has also won enough private wine market in Steri, but his reputation is not Sofia, etc. People are so big, there are not many people who know him. He rarely takes the initiative to show off the limelight. This is a smart person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gabrin didn’t know Tolan. He looked up and down Tolan twice and then rudely reached out, but looked at Tolan’s hand. Always parked in the air. He was a little angry, and the cooked ducks were flying. How could he be happy? The appearance of this young man means that he lost tens of thousands or more, and after losing the results of half a year of operation, he suffered losses, no one will be happy, and this young man is one of the culprit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the troublesome Mr. seems to be not interested in my goodwill... It doesn't matter, can you tell me what kind of trouble do I need to solve?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerberlin still didn't talk, and Natiya stood on the side explained, then Tolan took out a checkbook and signed two cash sums of 90,000. The check was placed on the table. Last year, the imperial central bank expanded the maximum limit of cash checkbooks from 5,000 to 50,000, but sometimes people complain that they are not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyers around Gabriel took two checks and checked them. After confirming that they were real checks, they asked Natiya and then went to fight. On the phone, he needs to check from the bank to see if the two checks can be cashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
