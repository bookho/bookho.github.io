			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the stunned eyes in Hite’s eyes make these guys who have been expelled feel overwhelmed. Some people think that if someone stands up and fights, maybe This guy from Hite will kill. He pointed to the guys who were like cockroaches and turned and walked outside the bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a cigarette, licked it on his mouth and took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police officer who just pulled the gun was standing by his side at this time. The young police officer did not have a gun on the bank. The courage and perseverance, but a hint of panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, killing people, no matter what the other party is doing right or wrong, in this era, everyone in this society will tell people around you not to hurt others easily. Not to take away the lives of others. This is a universal value, a universal morality, and people believe that it is right to stick to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he just killed a citizen less than a minute ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hite took the cigarette off his mouth and stuffed it into the mouth of the little policeman. The guy took two breaths and suddenly coughed out. He coughed very fiercely, his back arched, and Hite patted his back and straightened him. "You did a good job. At that time, what you did was the most appropriate choice, not only If I am at fault, I will personally ask the mayor for your help." He patted the shoulder of the small police officer and gave a cry. "Give you three days of rest, adjust, but kill a criminal. There is nothing to guilty or regret, roll it, stinky boy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the policeman under his hand walked a few steps, he looked back at him, the sea In my heart, I was not happy with the face. He erected a middle finger and then waved his fist. The little policeman smashed the scorpion and quickly ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighing with a sigh, Hite rode on the horse and returned to the gate of the City Hall. I sorted out my clothes a little and went straight to see Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin didn’t know what was happening at the bank right now, he was on the phone. Lifting his finger slightly to the side of the sofa, Du Lin took the phone and went to the window and said it for a while before hanging the phone. He looked up at Hite and smiled and asked, "How? Is it handled?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hite squinted his face and then happily repeated all the things happening in the bank at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard that he had killed a guy, Du Lin thought it was good. Some people wouldn’t put their knives into their hearts if they didn’t I always feel that you don't dare to swear at him, so if you need one, let others who share the same idea see for yourself, which can be very effective in curbing production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the appeasement should appease a few words, and it can be seen that Hite seems to have a lot of psychological pressure. In Hite's narrative, the gun was opened by him, so Du Lin subconsciously thought that he did not ask him to do this, but he did so, so there would be some concerns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is completely unnecessary trouble, Du Lin said with a smile: "Just deal with a criminal who resists on the spot, you do not need any psychological burden." Remember that you are wearing a police cap on your head, which represents the decent appearance of the City Hall of Otis, representing the law enforcement power given to you by law. Only the brave police can maintain the security of a city. It’s much better than I thought. If there is such a thing next time, I will now authorize you to allow you to fire directly after warning the other party three times!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Of course, I don't mean that you have no responsibility at all. Go back and write a report to me. If you copy it, you can do it for others. I want this thing to deal with the media!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes... I understand!" Hett stood up in his chest, as he imagined, Doolin did not blame him, and even praised him. This made his heart fall completely to the ground. At the same time, he also felt the attitude of Du Lin, that is to be simple, to be direct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you fire three times, you can fire... I think it’s quite exciting when I think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hite came with a serious expression, and when he went back, his expression became very relaxed. When he returned to the office of the police station on the first floor, some police officers gathered around. There are some people from Ilyan with him, and there are some local people who want to know how the mayor treats this matter and what means to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Hite relayed Doolin’s words to them, more than 20 police officers in the entire police station cheered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling certainly did not know that his two words could make the style of the police station in Otis the most tough in the whole empire. Of course, this is the future. He was talking to Harry before Heiter knocked on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Harry’s Governor first congratulated Du Lin on successfully passing the hearing, although the results would take a few days to be publicized, but congratulations can be advanced. Secondly, there is something about repairing the railway. This is a big deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin told him the last time he wanted to build an east-west railway. He kept it in his heart. As a qualified politician, he can't fight alone in politics. Behind him, there are a group of noble-born businessmen who are supporting him. Otherwise, he has no chance to compete for the next party leader and the Prime Minister’s seat, even if there is a Magnus nomination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing the governor for several years, after the initial stage, he must make a counter-feedback to reward the consortium and supporters behind him. What Du Lin said is the best way to pay for the repair of the railway. This involves tens of millions of big projects. The supporters behind him are very interested in this project. Or it should be said that his supporters are interested in projects that make money and make big money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investing so much in Harry is not for this moment, and for the next twelve years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry asked Du Lin when he could get the project up, and Du Lin gave him a reply, three months later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs three months to raise funds, and by the way, waits for another person's decision - Rani. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the law of the imperial empire and the law related to taxation, he must pay at least half of the tax collected from the smuggling merchants, that is, more than one hundred Wan, too much. If Rani can handle Magus, he will only pay a maximum of 25 percent, which is equivalent to hundreds of thousands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three months more than one million per month, this is not a small amount of money. In addition to throttling funds for urban development, he will probably be able to get around eight million in three months. With these eight million, the advanced project can be started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after all, it is still a question of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where can I get a sum of money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money that I returned? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thought was vetoed by Du Lin’s mind when he flashed through it. It was a fool’s job, and suddenly there was a bubble in his mind. Ideas, and have a great success rate, but they also need to be carefully crafted. Then he called a phone to Albert, let the guy come to see him, and he had something to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Otis is undergoing tremendous changes every day. The hotspots that people discussed before are often the ones who have born, and who have fewer geese. thing. Now they are discussing that the place may be rebuilt, that place may be demolished, and then with the envy and hateful look to "bless" those who are about to be demolished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the potential of the city of Otis has begun to show, the price of the city of Otis is also changing rapidly, from the three hundred can buy a rough The house of 50 or 60 square meters, now needs seven or eight hundred pieces to buy such a house. In just one month, the house price has doubled and turned. All locals are beneficiaries, whether they choose to move back after demolition, or choose to sell their house, they can make a fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this atmosphere, the local people’s favor for Doolin is rising, and Du Lin has laid a solid foundation for the upcoming voting stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a good day, Nasha’s old man came, Mark George, now almost the next generation of the George family. people. Many people are very optimistic about him, not his ignorant brother Arthur, who is now more and more stable in the family, and even the heads of the three most important feature agencies in the family industry have secretly contacted. Pass him and show his allegiance to him - wait for John to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not meet the person when he was notified. Instead, he sat in the office waiting for Mark’s arrival. Mark and Mr. Jack are different. Mr. Jack and the "poker" have more strength than the George family, which is only one of them. The second is because Du Lin has a good relationship with Mr. Jack. He helped Du Lin's busyness, so Du Lin must be polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark did not help Du Lin, even Du Lin has never seen this person, and such a character is a news point, once he takes the initiative to descend himself The station greets Mark, and maybe the news will enter Marcus's ear. Du Lin, who talked with Margots very well, knew that the leader of Magus, the new party leader, had a bad impression on businessmen. Even if he had a good impression, he chose to stand on Magus, it must be standing in the end. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
