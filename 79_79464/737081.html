			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes some people become idiots when they are hot, smart people look down on idiots, but don’t know that the world is becoming more ugly because of these idiots. Beautiful. If no one knows that it is very likely that they will never be able to return to their hometowns and return to their loved ones and return to their own shoulders to shoulder the burden of defending the country, what will the world look like? Are the soldiers who are heroic sacrifices to defend the country stupid? They are really stupid, but they deserve people to respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savi is still young, he doesn’t understand this, but he knows that if he doesn’t stand up, his brother, Doolin and others may be left behind. Then there is a shootout. It is possible that someone will die. He does not want to see anyone who admires himself hurt and sacrifice. At that moment, he felt the heavy burden that the name of the storm captain brought him. He can choose to be dumb, because Du Lin gave him the task he did well, and blocking the pursuit is not his task, he can completely ignore it. However, under the control of his unclear power, he did not even think about it, he took out a pistol for self-defense and killed the escort that was caught up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the departure of Du Lin’s group of people, he was not sad, only feeling that he was worth doing. He didn't know how to do this for Du Lin, and he would give other people an impression. He only knows that this is the moment he should pay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savi did not consider being captured by these people because he was not sure if he could survive those terrible penalties, so he has been actively fighting back. If you can't kill the three guards, let yourself be killed by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he made his decision and was about to start an active attack, the corner of his eye found three things that were shaking. In terms of dynamic vision, humans are actually not much worse than animals, or all species instinctively more sensitive to moving things. He saw Doolin, saw the Buddha, and saw the guy named Schubert. Du Lin’s group of people hid behind the visual dead corner of the aisle. He raised his hands and pointed to the other side. Savi’s heart lifted his hands behind the sofa. “Don’t shoot, my companion left me running. It doesn't make sense for me to continue to resist. I surrender!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side came with a voice of anger and anger. "You throw your pistol out and then slowly stand. Get up, damn little devil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was suppressed by a little pistol and let the three guards look a bit ugly, when Savi lost their pistol and slowly stood When I got up, a guard raised the gun and wanted to shoot, but one hand stopped him in time. "Don't shoot, I know you are very sad, but now this little devil can't die." He glanced at his head. Flowering dead and transparent colleagues, sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, no one has come up until now, which shows that the following has changed. The group has already escaped. If the little devil is killed again, then the clue is likely to be broken. This little devil and the group of robbers are together. Children are more difficult to resist various penalties than adults. As long as they can open their mouths as soon as possible, and get time for everyone, maybe they can save the lost things back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as things are recovered, the highest level of bank punishment for them is a matter of punishment. But if things can't be recovered, as a bank's escort, the duty is to protect the bank's security staff, they must bear the main responsibility. They can't afford it. This is the Imperial Central Bank. They can't resist the will of this huge monster, so this little devil is especially important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three guards seem to have given up to chase another group of people, they are aiming at Savy with a gun, close to him, and one of them is going around When the sofa was ready to be uniformed by Savi, he looked at the three people standing at the corner of the walkway with horror. He immediately wanted to squat down, but Savi pulled out a narrow dagger from behind his waist and stabbed him into the waist. At the same time, Du Lin and other three people also rushed out, there is no suspense to kill the other two under one face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked over to the sofa and reached for Savi, Savvy smiled and then calmly picked up his pistol. The guard, who was pleading on the ground, pulled the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Clean up their weapons, let's go now!" At this point, the escort car has left for a while, and the alarm sounds on the streets in the distance. The flashing red and blue lights are particularly glaring. Now they can only leave on foot. Fortunately, here is the city center, and it is also a crowded place. Walking away is safer than driving away. Savi smashed the rifle, wrapped it with a tablecloth and then carried it on his back. After seeing no other problems around him, Du Lin immediately took everyone back from the back door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just out of the back door of the bank, I saw the guard coming back from the alley with a gun. He looked at Du Lin’s group and lost his strength. Lying on the ground slowly against the wall. A few blood vessels in his body were screaming and screaming at the blood. He pressed the wound hard but could not stop the blood from overflowing. He could only breathe in weakness and wait for the death to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We walked separately, Savi, you find a place to keep these guns, and then go to the old place to meet.", Du Lin took a shot of Savi's shoulders. The little guy nodded hard and immediately slammed his legs toward the alley. He slammed the wall and turned the wall away. Looking at the Buddha by Du Lin, "Be careful, don't try to alarm the police, or I can't guarantee that I can save you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufu smiled and took a cigarette, gave Du Lin a reassuring look, and then learned the appearance of Savy and turned over the wall. The sound of the intensive police car alarm sounded on the outside street, and the familiar sound of the old dog of Prando. Du Lin sneered and snorted twice, stunned Schubert and looked at the exit of the alley. Look around. At this time, a police car had stopped at the alley, and Du Lin actually did not leave, but went back to the bank garage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schubert doesn't know what he is going to do, but he knows that there is nothing wrong with following Du Lin. With his skill he does not seem to have the ability to escape across the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember when I entered, there was a sewer cover on the platform?" Du Lin asked as he walked inward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schubert nodded quickly. "It is true. That place leads directly to the sewage outlet...", his mind flashed and blurted out, "Your Does it mean to leave from the sewage outlet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sewage outlet directly along with the urban underground sewage system, the underground sewage system was severely damaged during the war, and rebuilt after the war. At that time, the expansion and transformation were carried out on the basis of the original, which complicates the sewer system that was not so complicated. Even with construction drawings, I am afraid it will be difficult to find a way out in a short time. At the same time, there are some tramps and cockroaches in the sewers. The sewers in the spring season are not the most unbearable tastes, and they are the best shelter for these homeless people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the steps of the back door of the bank, Du Lin took out two crowbars from the tool cabinet, one for Schubert and one for himself. Under his instructions, the manhole cover was opened without much effort. The internal sewage system of the bank is very sound and there are lighting equipment. When you first entered the sewage pipeline, you could hear a huge roar and accompanied by a slight vibration. This is a bank-specific sewage smashing system that automatically snaps once every three minutes to prevent the robbers who attempt to invade the bank from the sewer. At the same time, it also smashed all the large garbage that may block the sewage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know where the computer room is?", Du Lin glanced at the T-shaped passage, and Schubert hesitated to point toward the inside of the bank. Direction, "This should lead to the engine room of the underground vault, but we don't have the key to the computer room..." He closed his mouth in a timely manner because he saw the key to the light of Duling's palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, Prando’s face gloomy through the megaphone and shouted something that he didn’t even believe, and put down his arms and raised his hands from the gate. Come out, these fierce robbers even the Imperial Central Bank dare to rob, and will obey the arrogant lay down arms and choose to surrender? Then why do they risk the huge central bank’s overnight risk of looting the Imperial Central Bank? Is it too long to live, or do you feel that ordinary life lacks passion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
