			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equity of the Imperial Central Bank has never flown out. From the very beginning they stepped out of this step, united multiple individual banks and applied to the central bank before they Know what you are doing. They have become the most powerful economies in the empire. At least 50 million people in the entire empire work directly or indirectly for the imperialist central bank. Even if the cabinet wants to change some of the policies of the imperial central bank, it must be very careful. Going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the entire imperial central bank, the main control of the equity is in the hands of the damn directors, who have mastered nearly half of the equity, enough to guarantee They have absolute control over the imperial central bank on the board, and they have established shareholder penalties regulations that are enforced when anyone is allowed to own a portion of the imperial central bank. Once they have done something that is detrimental to the imperial central bank, the central bank can initiate this clause to buy back their shares. If they don't want to lose all their shares, the best way is to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the question of who owns the equity is not the question of who has money, but the question of the attitude of the directors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old men have suffered a lot in this life, in the old feudal society, when they were just poor and humble businessmen, even the nobles. The slaves are able to kick their ass without taking any responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They certainly have great scenery, for example, from the new years to the present, they have mastered the financial lifeline of the empire and become hidden in the financial world. The "second empire". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to impress them. For those old people who have eaten hard and have enjoyed the power to bring great taste, they need constant victory. And other people's obedience to their will, there will be no other things that can shake their decisions, whether it is wealth, power, or women! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way home, Dinesha looked at the scenery on the street outside the window and was silent. If they could not complete the task, they would certainly not be Any punishment, everyone knows that Doolin is a fortress that is difficult to overcome, but they will also lose the opportunity to end all of this. It is necessary for Du Lin to win the lives of her sisters on the normal track. This is what she hopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister, what are you thinking, Doolin?", Dini, sitting on the other side, is wearing underwear. This is a very luxurious car. The interior space is very large. The Imperial Bank has never been short of money. Spend money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire car is divided into front and rear parts, the driver's cab and the rear are completely blocked visually, even the sounds need to press the button to each other I heard that this was to prevent some drivers from eavesdropping on important commercial secrets. This kind of thing happened before, of course, at that time, it was not called a driver, called a coachman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial central bank attaches great importance to confidentiality. This car is specially tailored to serve the top of the imperial central bank. Before she met Du Lin, Di Nia took off her underwear in the car, and now she put it on, obviously not at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinissa smiled. "I was thinking about how we should take Du Lin. You know, equity is very important to us, only those who own it." We can live the life we ​​want in order to get the family business on the right track."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of my sister’s statement, Diniya snorted, My innocent sister, if we can get these shares, why should we give them? Or do you like the little cousin who is full of ass?", not waiting for Dinesha to refute, her voice has strengthened a lot. Covering the desire of Dinesha to argue, "I know, I know, you always think that the family should be better, because this is the mission that the family has given us. But I ask you to think about it, the family gives What are we, why do we give the opportunity to those people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because they are trying to get us to the bed of those people? Or let us not Don't you deal with the old man who can be our grandfather?", Di Niyi Dislike, "Don't be stupid, they treat us as goods, then we should not treat them as our family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as there is even One-tenth of the equity, we are free, we can also enter the board of directors to become a real shareholder, and we don’t need to take care of the cousin who is full of brains, understand?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinissa’s face became a bit ugly, although she didn’t want to admit it, but she couldn’t help it. No matter what reason their father, uncle and monk used to make them what they are now, they are all victims. In the minds of so-called loved ones, there is no family, only interests, interests and interests. They only care about when they can reinvigorate the family's reputation, how to make more money so that they don't go bankrupt, how to be more decent and smoother and reintegrate into today's high society to show their lame social skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the lives of their two sisters and the current problems? It is not that the family needs a relationship, and even the family may still think that they are not doing enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least when we were very young, they were good." Dinisha retorted it very hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diniya nodded a little and replied in a sarcasm. "Exactly, because those big men didn't think about us at that time." "It may be illegal." Looking at the complicated and sad face on her sister's face, she quickly changed the topic. She held the two melons that she secretly hid. "Du Lin said that they are a bit slack. Is it true? Why can't I feel this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinissa raised her hand to cover her eyes and didn’t want to say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sisters have suffered a lot of treatments that they should not have, but at least they are doing well now. The imperial central bank’s expansion has been completed so far, and there are no heavyweight opponents. They need to continue to go out in person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is completely different from Du Lin, Du Lin is always able to encounter enough troubles, and most of them have to deal with it personally, because he does not If you go in person, someone may want to lose your job, such as a creature called the author. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After standing in the window on the third floor of the manor, watching the sisters of the Hill family leave, Doolin looked up at the watch and left the next meeting for an hour. He can take a break for a while. This time, the person he invited was the person of the Imperial Social Service Bureau. The imperial capital is not allowed to break ground, and his TV station cannot be built in one day. This is a very terrible thing. Although it is said that other cities can now carry out the business of TV stations, there is a lack of important "properties" in those places. Nothing is more important than starting work in the Imperial City. After all, it is the core of imperial politics. This will let many people know what they should do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, when the emperor encountered troubles and left to go to other places to operate, may encounter local resistance, after all, the emperor refused, they What is the reason not to refuse? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little rest for more than half an hour, the butler woke up Du Lin. "Master, the Social Service Bureau is here."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sighed and pulled down from the lounge chair. The maid immediately began to sort out his slightly messy shirt for Du Lin and then put on his jacket. Thanks to this manor for having a good cold circulation system, at least wearing a coat inside does not make people feel too hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
