			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment when Amp was about to board the ramp, a naval officer faced him and several other intelligence personnel to read the federal decree to expel them, and Tell them from this moment that they are not allowed to land on the federal, otherwise federal soldiers have the power to kill them directly. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is just a cut-off, so the size of the country and the relatively rare border soldiers, wanting to send an expelled person into the Union with the falsification ability of the empire Just like breathing is a simple matter. After the reading, Amp was allowed to board the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a period of time when the warship sailed away from the federal military port, a blond-haired diplomat walked into the restroom, and he looked blankly at the moment he just got The release of the Imperial Intelligence personnel is a bit complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time in exchange for these "heroes", the empire exchanged a group of captured federal spies as chips, which is a very dangerous thing in itself. . When an intelligence officer started learning how to become a qualified intelligence officer, they had a lot of skills, and even some people had very special talents. These people have many rare opportunities in the process of being interrogated to get news that is not available in the formal way. In fact, it turns out that they have heard a lot of news from the trial. Once they return to the federation, they will reveal the appearance accent of the intelligence personnel who arrested them and the intelligence information of the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a serious threat to the internal staff of the empire, but the General Intelligence Bureau and the Cabinet have already determined this matter, there is no room for recovery, only hope These exchanged intelligence personnel can provide the same amount of information to provide some valuable information that makes it impossible for intelligence personnel who have not been arrested within the federal government to escape a disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very honored to take over the heroes and cabinets to take home the heroes, and to say sorry for the torture and pain you have suffered during this time.", The intelligence personnel around the body and bruises straight up and looked at him, want to see if this guy can say something different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to become an intelligence person, in addition to having enough talent and learning ability, you need to be smart enough. Here are a few of them. So they look a bit more realistic than their own performance, especially after suffering from inhumane torture. Their current personal information has been learned by the entire federal intelligence department, which means that their next life will say goodbye to the past, but it is not necessarily the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are better, they may turn to the back office personnel, but because their looks will become the repeated memory of every federal intelligence personnel who infiltrated the empire, the first-line internal staff must not do it, and can only do one auxiliary. Work, such as an interrogation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the empire does not intend to arrange them into the back office, they will be placed in a factory to become workers, or become a small staff of a company. And then, like many ordinary people, struggle for life and family for a lifetime. All the glory and experience of the past is like an illusory journey. They can't tell anyone, and they can't let anyone know what they have done before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the next period of time, you will have plenty of time to heal, and the Empire will arrange the best doctors to do your best for your health. We are going home. Nothing to worry about!" The diplomat nodded and turned and prepared to leave, but an intelligence officer stopped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His diplomat, you have not said how the empire intends to arrange our next work and life, which is very important to us!" They were all bandages, and there was one less eyeball. During the interrogation, the federal people pierced his eyes with a steel. In order to avoid the death of the infection in advance, they also made an eyeball removal surgery for him, and the wounds were cleaned so that he would not die too fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diplomat’s pace was turned around and he looked at him and said, “I’m not in charge of this, but please rest assured, the future. Life won't be your burden!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who lost his eyeball suddenly stood up, if not for the back of his chair, It may have fallen. At this time, Amp noticed that his left leg was below the knee, and was also sawn off during the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a little excited, his eyes were red, and he waved his arms and said loudly, "You want to knock us out? This is not fair, we are The empire has paid so much and should not be abandoned. Even if it is possible for me to be an instructor, you should know that I have not said anything in the truth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The diplomat shook his head and shook his head. "Sir, you may not understand, we have not abandoned anyone. It is just that your situation is not suitable for high-intensity work, so we will follow you for your strengths." The middle school in your hometown has arranged a teacher's job. You can teach a group of outstanding talents, and there will be a calm life. Isn't that good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the General Intelligence Bureau did not consider the exchange of prisoners at all, so the arrangements for these people naturally do not exist. After the General Intelligence Administration considered some issues, the final decision was made to "retire" them. This decision is actually not so good, at least it is not the worst choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this one-eyed "hero" doesn't think so, he wants to be closer to the diplomat, by the way, the diplomat You are actually an intelligence officer, but his rank is higher and his role is more special, so he gave his diplomat a special status and allowed him to have diplomatic immunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not fair, we have paid so much for the country, you are not qualified..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp His words have not been finished, the diplomat's expression changed slightly, and his face was interrupted by cold face. "Please pay attention to your previous identity, sir. I call you heroes, not because you are really heroes." You are a loser and a prisoner than other colleagues who are searching for important information inside the federation. We can't tell if you have been bought by the United States as a double-faced spy, so this is the best for you. Processing the results. If you are still doing this, you know what you will face!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman of one eye immediately stunned, and the expression on his face was excited Become stiff and unnatural, he also realized the identity of the diplomat and his colleague, otherwise he would not know so much. All the arrested intelligence personnel returning to the empire and welcoming them are definitely not flowers and praises, but will be included in the anti-spyware program. In the next three months, there will be no known how many trial interrogators will continue to interrogate him without interruption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These interrogation results will eventually come together to identify whether the intelligence officer has changed. If there is doubt, or uncertainty, then follow the apostate, as far as the end is not as good as the death in the federal territory. Even if all the trial results are consistently affirmed, there is a good chance that they will return to society and become one of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who were on the surface or really did not loosen after the fall, everyone was very admired and respected, but would like to regain the appointment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is impossible, because this special occupation does not require losers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
