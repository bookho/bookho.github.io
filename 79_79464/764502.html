			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Juan’s silence, Du Lin did not urge, no matter which method he chose, Du Lin had the means to let him go to the last step, the only The difference is just the size of your own loss. In the long wait, the car parked outside the largest bar in the first district. At this time, it was still dark for a long time. Although there were many guests in the bar, they were too quiet when it was crazy at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two got off the car and entered the second floor of the bar from the back door in the alley behind the bar. It was Juan’s office in the first district. He doesn't usually come here because it is too noisy. He is getting older and can't bear the atmosphere. He needs quiet and self-cultivation, not the following hormones that are overflowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room gradually began to cool down after the door was closed. Although people have not invented a small air conditioner, the use of ice has matured. s method. There are not only ice in the mezzanine of the wall, but also a copper tube with water flowing in it. It constantly removes the heat in the room. The temperature inside is lower than the outdoor temperature by four or five degrees, which is enough to make people feel cool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan looked at the crowded heads on the street outside the window. After a while, he bit his teeth and made up his mind. He faced Du Lin and smiled and said the answer that Du Lin was most satisfied with. "I chose the first option. We set up a company to develop and then negotiate with the George family. I thought that this method actually has more. More operability, as long as we stand firm together in the final negotiation process, they must respect our decision!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for so long In the decision, Juan actually thought a lot, especially on the East Coast Entertainment Company. Although it seems that he spent more than 410,000 more than the actual investment, the equity is 30% less. He was not sure if Eric’s disappearance had a direct relationship with Doolin. He had no evidence to prove it. He also arranged for people to look for Eric. He had no choice until he got the evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sees this as a warning, a warning to him. It was precisely because of this warning that he finally made the decision to establish a company with Du Lin. He did not know if Du Lin would continue to make tricks if two people invested in East Coast Entertainment, he would rather establish the company's respective investments, and would not be willing to bear one of the possible consequences. And to do so he has more freedom, Du Lin's efforts are of course the best result, but he does not work hard and will not drag his own legs, but can prove that he is the most suitable partner of the George family, why not choose This one? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin shrugged and did not show any dissatisfaction and complaints. "That line, I will arrange for people to proceed to the next step. So where do you want to start? We can't repeat investment in a certain area. Theater construction, this will cause unnecessary consumption."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Doolin did not raise this question, Juan was also planning to propose it, he smiled, "I I plan to invest in 11 cities in the next-door state. You know, I am getting older, and excessive running is not good for health. I hope you can understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I can understand, then I will go a little further!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two have consulted on some of the following issues for a while Du Lin got up and said goodbye. At the moment when the door was closed, both of them were relieved at the same time, and they all converge on the false smile on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin licked his lips and planned to go here, neither he nor Juan could not turn back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when he knew that the George family intended to lay out the film circle, he had already given up his dream of becoming a film tycoon. The wealth and political power of the George family is that he and Juan can compete? To say a bad word, the other party only needs to say hello to Magus, Du Lin and Juan will not be able to buy even the land, no matter how much they pay! This is the worst guess. If the Georges want to ensure their absolute control in the film industry, they will make more intensive repetitive investments in the same area. Doolin and Juan are fundamental. It is not the opponent of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin gave up some unrealistic ideas, focused on how to make Juan bankrupt, and then took over his brewing workshops and bars, that It is what he wants most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before that, Du Lin had to do one thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reaching out to the upper class, he found that money is really worthless. This sentence may be very contradictory, but the specific explanation is not so contradictory. When there is no money, maybe 12,000 is a big number, and can do a lot of things. After actually owning tens of millions of property, he discovered that the money could not do much. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is related to another situation, that is, the polarization of wealth. Some people say that 95% of the world's wealth is controlled by 5 percent of people. Everyone wants to be 5 percent of them, but in reality they may only be six percent and percent. Seven or even ten percent of the other small. 30 million gold plus other money is unimaginable in Du Lin’s previous life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he got to this point, he discovered that the money was enough to make him a five percent in a city, but it was harder to become a fifth in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs money and needs more money, so he has a second step plan - continue to swindle money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​cheating money comes from Eric’s behavior, which makes Du Lin realize that people’s understanding of financial games at this time is still in a relatively primitive stage. He can use this method to fish, but the chance is only once or twice. Once too many attempts will inevitably lead to social turmoil, exacerbate the contradictions between classes, and thus attract the attention of the top of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Magus personally opened the name of Doolin, he had no other way than to flee the Federation, so the number could not be many, but To get enough money, you need Xie Lisi Street to help him, and he also wants to thank Juan for everything he has done for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before returning home, Du Lin called Albert and asked him to set up the manager company as soon as possible, and he went to Kevin, who had not been in contact for a long time. a phone call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin was also very surprised when he received a call from Du Lin, and he was a little happy. People always can't forget the poor friends of the past when they were developed. . It’s not how much humanity and nostalgia they have. It’s purely a sense of vanity that shows off the poor friends and shows off their glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Kevin’s happiness is doomed to be inconclusive, because he still has no Doolin rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am surprised that you can call me this. This shows that the infrastructure of the Tern is also close to the infrastructure of the developed areas in the infrastructure, at least you There is a telephone line now?", Kevin’s words are filled with a taste that makes people want to punch a punch on his face. It seems that he seems to be complimenting the construction of the Tern area. It is actually a taunt The Tel A region is backward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this ridicule has nothing to do with Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I am not in Tener now, I am in Irian, and I am currently settled here. We gossip less, I have something to help you. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!", Kevin's voice in the microphone interrupted Doolin's next words, and then said that Du Lin really wanted to swear by him. "My current hourly consultation fee is 800, no. I will send you a fee payment slip to an hour in one hour. You will leave an address for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is silent for a moment, forbearance I can't help but say: "You vampire, may the light be with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is yelling at me every day, but I feel that you are awkward It's the most innovative one. If you don't want to accept this price, I can give it to you for five minutes. We can talk about something else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay Ok, eight hundred? Is it? I will pay for it.” Du Lin couldn’t help but smile. Kevin, who was on the other end of the phone, laughed. Both thought about the scene when they first met. Du Linna also said that smuggling is better than being a lawyer. At least lawyers robbery does not break the law, but smuggling is illegal. "Help me find someone, Xie Li. People on the street know a lot about finance and the company. It is best to have a lawyer who is very familiar with the law and familiar with financial related laws. I want to hire them.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Age? Is there any need? Gender? I suggest you choose women because women are more meticulous about details. They may not be as good at men as they are, but I believe you are not Will let other people make decisions for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you believe it? Just a few nonsense I have to pay you 800, your lawyer Is the office still missing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't confess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next time When I meet, I promise, I will kill you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this intimidating to know? It is a thousand an hour now!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin left the address and then talked with Kevin for a while. After all, 800 yuan an hour of consulting fees, he did not say a few words really. Point deficit. Although verbally complaining that Kevin is not human at all, Du Lin is willing to pay the money. He knows that Kevin has his own principles, and he also knows that this guy will get things done as long as he has collected the money. He prefers Kevin to do more, and does not want Kevin to avoid money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
