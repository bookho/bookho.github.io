			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is a very serious person. There is no doubt about this, because in the countryside, if you are not serious, Mr. Xema will never let him go. This also cultivated the serious characteristics of Doolin's work. It took only two days to let these high-class decent people who like to enjoy the fine art at the Grand Theatre, recognize this car washer called Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always washes every corner of every car very cleanly, even if it is some hidden gap, he will use a sharpened The wooden branches are pressed through the towel and the dirt is cleaned. He didn't like the other car washers on the side of the road, and casually fooled it, and put his face on the toilet to the cost of washing the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin, who had a certain reputation in just two days, was very happy, and his plan went one step further. He even started to plan another paragraph. After the time, I will absorb the other car wash workers who are not good at the roadside and work for him. It will not take long for him to rent a facade on the roadside for car beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word car beauty is what he learned from his dreams, not just a simple car wash, but also includes certain maintenance and modification. He doesn't know anything about this. He can be in the city of Tener. All he needs is to bring those people over and become his employees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s a pity that Du Lin’s dream of “car wash kingdom” was just shattered when he had just taken the first step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s this guy who has been robbing our guests for not following the rules!", a carer with a slightly darker skin and a thin body with a cap standing in a group The side of the person, pointing to Du Lin who is washing the car on the side of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this city, there are some people who don’t know much about it, we can call it the dark side, or we can say these people and their world, Called the underground world. The gangs are not only in the city of Tener, but even in the more distant and prosperous core of the Empire and the developed regions, there is such a phenomenon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like having a sun in a world that has a darkness that cannot be taken care of by the sun. Everything has two sides. The Yaoxing Empire, which has just emerged from the Civil War, is actively seeking change while licking the wounds left in the war. Any change that is enough to change people's lives often means huge risks and huge benefits. The benefits of the sun, as well as the interests of the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of these gangs is not to make the city more chaotic, it may make people feel ridiculous, and what they do looks more like a policeman than the police. They use force to deter to maintain a stable order in the site. They erect one rule after another, and people dare not pass. It is they who have made the city a lot more peaceful, and there are fewer bad people on the street who are ready to take a ticket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are like dark viruses that are constantly consuming the light of infection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the skinny monkey-like guy, there are four strong young men, and the leading one is wearing a blue plaid shirt with a blue bottom. A short jacket with a beige cap. He wants to make himself look like a decent person, but the flesh that beats his face from time to time is always hard to believe his identity and status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded at this time and took the cap off. This street is his territory. In the city of Tener, some people who know him, They call him Mad Dog Weissen. In his self-promotion, he once succeeded in killing 17 or 18 enemies in a gun battle on the street with a gun. People called him a mad dog because of his madness and viciousness. He liked this outside. number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked to Doolin with his three men, Du Lin was washing the car, and there were two cars to wash. When he was just about to put the towel back in the bucket to clean it, a brown shiny shoe appeared in his sight and kicked the bucket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is still not sure what happened, he straightens up and looks at the four men who are as fierce as the fierce, and some inexplicably nodded. "Gentlemen?", he doesn't understand what these people want to do, but just feels that they may have a big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Sen looked up and down Du Lin, smirked and glanced at the half-washed car. "Is it safe to pay?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amble fee? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?", Du Lin’s face was awkward, although it felt like these people should be looking for it, but the word “安乐费” doesn’t sound so much. Deaf people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two years ago, the Anole fee was not called an easy fee, called a protection fee. It is a compulsory fee levied by local gangs on all operators in their own sites. After paying the protection fee, they can operate normally and enjoy the protection of gangs. If it is not paid, then the gang will continue to go to the door to find trouble, so that the business can not operate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, because a fallen aristocrat who had a baronial title was unsuccessful in collecting protection fees, he was attacked by gangs and seriously injured and admitted to the hospital, which attracted the attention of the empire. The gang behind the creation of this case - precisely no longer an ordinary gang, but a family with a religious nature of family, after a trial of more than 170 days, eventually smoothed out This matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since then, the term "protection fee" has become a past tense, now called the Anole fee. This vocabulary may be somewhat old-fashioned, but it is very capable of achieving a relatively perfect meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wiesen is also somewhat inexplicable, and the whole thing is the whole city of Tener, the people of the entire Yaoxing Empire know what it means, this kid actually does not know? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, he thought that the other party was playing with himself, and he rushed to the top for a moment, and he swung out with a fist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do if I have a dispute in the country? The police must have no, not to mention the judge, so in the countryside, the fist became the so-called fair. Whose fist is big, then whoever has reason. Mr. Kesma’s family has also had disputes with others. For example, the stone that is almost a few pounds but can be blown away by the wind is a normal thing to fight in the country because of the land ownership. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma has a very strong skill and is often the last winner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment Du Lin saw the other side hitting his fist, he leaned back and slammed his fist, and subconsciously punched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This punch is very tricky and heavy, and the sai (sai) directly from the bottom right is on the opponent's jaw. Wissen’s head was suddenly hit up, and the saliva in his mouth flew out along the slightly open lips, his eyes became a bit stunned, and his footsteps were slightly vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passers-by and shopkeepers who are concerned about the situation on the street can’t help but sigh, this guy is really in trouble. The two-day roadside store’s impression of Doolin was very good. He washed the road with clean water every time he washed the car, leaving no trace of sewage and stains. Even if he borrows water, he will give a penny of coins, never taking water. If anyone needs to help with a handle, or move something, as long as Du Lin is free, he will definitely help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
