			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin closed his eyes, recalling and Prando The process of making and the process of getting along, he remembers that more than one person told him that Prando is a smiling fox, he is always laughing. Laugh when you are happy, and laugh when you are not happy. Just when you are "eaten", you smile with the same smile. There are also several tycoons who have been carried out by him in the city of Tener, but people are always confused by his good side and his smile. He is not really a person who has no temper. He is not a person who has offended him and he can still swallow. He will be angry and will retaliate. Only in the process can you only see his smile, so I ignore it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin remembered the experience on the road to prison, remembered the three trucks filled with private liquor to go to Guri, and also remembered the farm The process of attacking Erlis. All the survivors in these processes have the same view - the other side has a lot of weapons, some people have a good match in the battle, and their goals are pure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In combination with these factors, Du Lin believes that in addition to Prando, there should be another person standing behind him. It may be his "boss" or his partner. This person is very powerful, has a lot of people, and there are plenty of weapons. The most important thing is that he is sufficiently concealed in the city, hidden until now, except for Prando and very few people, no one knows who Prando's boss is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has a guess, this person will be... the captain of the Tener Gendarmerie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are gendarmerie teams in every city. Since the New Party came to power, almost every city has a gendarmerie, and their missions have been to suppress riots. The central government strengthens the purpose of local control. The power of the gendarmerie is great, but it is also small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s said that it’s because the gendarmerie has certain arms and arbitrary powers, once there is riots, turmoil and even some extreme reorganizations. If you want to do something in the process of the imperial transformation of the empire, the gendarmerie team can not ask for instructions from the higher authorities, and directly force the suppression of force. This means that the gendarmerie's dispatch is a very ideal judgment. If the captain of the gendarmerie thinks that it needs to be dispatched, even if his purpose is not simple and fails, he will not be subject to excessive punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that its power is small because the gendarmerie has very limited local interference in addition to force. It is not an administrative authority. It does not have the ability to enforce the law. As long as the external outbreak does not affect the riots of a regional sovereignty issue, the gendarmerie has no power to do something on its own initiative. No matter what happens in the city, they can only look at their eyes wide open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Du Lin thought of another guy, the mayor of Peter in the city of Tener, who got up early from the gendarmerie, then this is Isn't there a possibility that there is a certain inevitable relationship between Prando, the gendarmerie, and the mayor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is possible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Prando is not actively taking action on Du Lin, or is someone instructing him to do so. If he himself wants to get rid of Du Lin, then Du Lin will not be soft, and will inevitably treat Prando as the first enemy. But if someone instructed him to do this, is this person the mayor or the gendarmerie captain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the situation of the recent gendarmerie?" Du Lin opened his eyes and asked, at this time the car has entered the suburbs, the house dumped on the roadside Everywhere. After the Great Patriotic War, the population of Tener has decreased dramatically. People have not believed that the next time the war broke out, the empire can still be so lucky this time, so the “poor people” who have nothing left in this neighborhood moved out of this place early and went to a place closer to the core of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s problem made Ail's a little embarrassed, who had nothing to do to stalk the gendarmerie, and there was no direct or between the gendarmerie and Doolin. Indirect stakes. He shook his head and didn't know how to answer this question that was not easy to answer. Du Lin took a shot of his own brain and pointed to Ellis. "Sorry, arrange one or two people who are reliable, see if there is any way." It is very important to be able to enter the gendarmerie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There will be no problems, rest assured, I will select qualified people as soon as possible to send them into The gendarmerie, you may not know, the gendarmerie also issued a notice a few days ago, saying that it is to recruit some recruits, this time they want to recruit 20 new recruits..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin captured a vocabulary very clearly - conscription, he immediately interrupted the enthusiasm of Alice, "I remember that every four years will be levied a soldier, this time Why is it ahead? If I remember correctly, the gendarmerie’s conscription time is also the time of the mid-term election.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellis shrugged his shoulders and the ghost knew why the gendarmerie would change the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Du Lin closed his eyes again, and when he opened again, the car had stopped at the Oriental Star Trading Company, which was transferred from Queen Street. . Through the glass, he can see that the original renovated shop was smashed, and almost no good things could be found. I don't know if the people around me or the garbage trucks have done it. The lobby on the first floor has become a garbage dump. Various kinds of household garbage are filled with them, and some people are pulling inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the outer wall of the door, some red paint was also splashed. In short, it was completely finished. If you want to fix it, you need at least a thousand. For Du Lin, who has no money now, it is definitely a huge sum. Fortunately, he does not need to worry about money, and soon his "business" and "factory" will work again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the Contraband Investigation Bureau, I am going to meet with Xiuen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin When the car was just approaching the Prohibition Bureau, it happened to see that Sinen drove out of the car. He saw Sin and Xien also saw him. Xiu En made a gesture of keeping up, and then quickly flew toward the south of the city. With the consent of Du Lin, Ellis immediately turned around and followed the car of Xiu'en. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About twenty minutes or so, the two cars parked outside a barbecue restaurant called "Sweet Beef Ribs". The most restaurants in the poor and backward city of Tener are such barbecue shops, not barbecue steaks, or barbecue beef, which is generally like the Tuxian snacks in the world of Doolin dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schoen got out of the car and went to the back of the car and knocked on the window. "Hold it here, if there is someone who will run out, Don't run for him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schoen got a message from other informants, and the guy who cheated him last time is now hiding here. This is a rare opportunity and opportunity. Even if he can't get any direct evidence of ruling Karur, he can know who is behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He entered the barbecue shop in less than thirty seconds, a small, small man wearing a brown-red cap rushed out of the gate, not even stopping Stopping on the sidewalk. Du Lin pointed to the guy and said that he stopped him. Ellis slammed the pedal of the hurdle, and the car slammed forward and hit the guy directly. He was thrown up by the great power, and the smashing bullet fell on the wall and screamed with a double scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
