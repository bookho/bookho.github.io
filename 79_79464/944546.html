			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the poker organization, in the next major work, the focus is still on cleaning all the money in the Western world that needs money laundering bosses, while Nor can you give up the huge gains that Du Lin’s plan extends. When the hymn consortium intends to find its own way to launder money, it means that the substantive relationship between the poker and the hymn consortium has broken down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually very simple. Once the singer consortium finds a way to launder money and keeps this channel in its own hands, it means a lot with them. A good relationship partner will consider giving money that may not be visible in his hand to the hymn consortium. The hymn consortium is safer, at least everyone in the consortium knows, and knows where they work, mainly those members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a sense that it is possible to catch this line through money laundering, which is important for some people's future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A customer has ended the partnership and intends to set up such a channel to snatch his own business, the poker is absolutely impossible to be happy, and this is still a certain ability Opponent. So for Du Lin’s request to buy intelligence, Mr. Jack himself made the decision to sell the information to Doolin and symbolically charge a dollar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, Soro’s whereabouts were made to let Du Lin know by phone, which is also the most proud place for poker. They not only have the world's most complete and safest money laundering channels, but also the most powerful intelligence network. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how they got Soro’s intelligence, Du Lin was somewhat clearer – the bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last meeting has already shown that the underground money launderer and the imperial central bank have a good relationship, so they want to ask someone’s check range. Naturally, it is also a small matter. Aristocratic members of the background like Soro rarely carry a lot of cash with them, which is not in line with their image. They tend to bring some change, and then there are two types of checkbooks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small checkbook of twenty denominations, and a large checkbook of one thousand or two thousand, as long as they use the check, this information It will soon be brought to the headquarters and then passed to all branch branches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first half of the year, the imperialist central bank caught a criminal who used the loopholes in the information gap to clean up the cheque. The criminal was only sixteen years old. He used his forged cheques and accounts to take a large amount of money in the imperial central bank without restrictions. Finally, I was alarmed by the Imperial Police Investigation Bureau before I caught this guy. He finally wanted to print the money himself, so he would be caught. Otherwise, it would be difficult to catch him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then the Imperial Bank has changed the mechanism for the use of checks, and they have strictly restricted the scope of the check. Simply put, the original checkbook can be used throughout the empire. Any place with an imperial central bank is redeemed, but now the checkbook issued by each state is only available in the state. After the use, the bank of the entire state will update the information within a few minutes, and then the information will be updated to the headquarters at the first time to avoid the illegal interception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you need to use checks across states, you need to go to the appropriate state one day in advance to apply for temporary signing rights. Mr. Jack can find the location of Soro because the guy is I applied for a temporary signature right two days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is in Woolland, the southernmost state of the empire and the most economically developed state. Cabinet members revealed that Magus seems to be interested in establishing a new SAR in Woolland, for deepening cooperation with the federal government in the last month's talks. The impact of this news is enough to make Luo Nai is tempted by the Fatima family because it involves import and export trade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is known that there are still eight years from the first recovery of tariff rights, which means that tariffs are still in the hands of the Federation during these eight years. The federal amnesty dumped federal goods through the tax-free and subsidized way to the empire's light industrial market, and in turn imposed high tariffs on the empire's exports to the federal goods, which has caused many traditional small craft workshops to disappear. In the eyes of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most common thing is the match. Now the empire has not seen a large-scale match factory except the North, because the federal match is cheaper, a box The number of matches inside is 12 more than the standard of the empire, which makes many small factories unable to maintain and finally close down. However, last month’s talks between the two countries talked about the rationalization and normalization of bilateral trade. Maggs spoke at the meeting and thought that the two sides were friendly. Inclusive bilateral trade can play a more positive role in promoting the economic construction of the empire and the federation. Reasonable, legal and normal are the core ideas of this content. The federal government, which has already realized that tariff rights are still to be handed over for eight years, is also interested in promoting this friendly trading atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, once the empire has taken back the tariff rights, if the two sides have not reached any intention before this, the retaliatory high tariff collection will trigger a new round of financial war, and there will be no positive for the status of the two Western powers. The role can only make other countries see jokes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After such friendly negotiations, the two sides believe that it is necessary to first establish a special area and try to implement a normal and reasonable tariff system in the region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, some export goods that are subject to high tariffs are likely to be executed according to normal tariffs when they are exported from the SAR to the Federation. . This means a huge profit that is unimaginable, and power – indicators. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal agreement to this request is not without any conditions. In the appendix of the monetary memorandum of understanding between the two parties, the federal designation of 23 commodities can reduce tariffs, but there is a limit. The problem. Each commodity has a ceiling for each month of export, and it will return to the high tariff range after reaching the upper limit. This is a decision made to avoid too fast and excessively stimulate the chaos of the federal domestic financial system. It is also a psychological preparation for the capitalists who have been dumping domestically and are not subject to retaliation for trade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can get the actual power of this SAR, the grandfathers of the Cape family think that the Fatima family is likely to join the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Solo, who is in charge of contacting the Fatima family, must do this, otherwise he will be kicked out of the team where the heirs compete for inheritance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sneaked into Doolin and Solo himself has forgotten about it in his busy schedule. What he is most concerned about now is where the SAR will be built, or That city, he must make a precise judgment and then lay out in advance, before the official announcement of the cabinet, everything will be done! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo, who just returned to the villa, was tired and lying on the sofa, thinking about the conversation between the governor and the governor with closed eyes, the governor of Woolland To tell the truth, I have been in the circle, which makes Soro sure that this guy knows the idea of ​​Magus. After all, demarcating a special zone must first communicate with the local governor. The cabinet is not really invincible. It really touches the governor who lacks a rib in the brain. He also ignores the administrative orders of the cabinet and has the ability to file a lawsuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how to let the other party say it is a difficult point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo frowned for a moment and asked, "What hobbies does he have, what are the hobbies of his family members? I have found a way to find this person." Disadvantages, we need his help!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ornes nodded, this is what he should do. Once Solo has successfully become the owner of the Cape family, he is the big steward and possibly the big secretary of the hymn consortium. The practical benefits of any of these two titles are beyond imagination, and he must do it for both Solo and himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo pulled out the checkbook from his pocket and wanted to tear ten sheets down, and then simply threw it directly to Ornes. This is a checkbook of two thousand blocks, a total of fifty, and can take out 100,000 pieces of cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a headache, you can help me get it as soon as possible, the place to spend money will be spent, the money is not enough, I will find a family, don't save money for me, Do you understand?" Soro glanced at Ornes, who believed that Ornes could understand what he meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was ordered to do things this time, all the funds and expenses of the family will be taken down, this time you do not need to spend money, the value is not worth it, just look at the flowers How much money can be done in the end. After success, all the money can be reimbursed. If it is not successful, the family will only be reimbursed 70%. There is actually water in it. After all, the family doesn't know how much it costs. It is even more impossible to prove that a certain person is letting him tell the truth. Is Solo sending him 100,000 pieces? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, everyone has a limit, too much is impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ornes took the checkbook on the table and put it in the lined pocket and turned away from the villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor of Woolland is a new party, and there is no doubt about this. At present, the governors of almost all developed regions are new party people, the opposite It is an economically backward or relatively closed area. Officials are members of the old party, such as the north or the southwest. It is not difficult to buy a new party member. This capitalist has long had a wealth of experience. On the contrary, it’s really hard to buy the old party that is decadent. Because they look down on the capitalists, they think that it’s right to buy money. My own humiliation, the damage to the family reputation, a very strange phenomenon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
