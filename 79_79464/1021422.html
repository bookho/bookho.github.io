			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheriff: (ΩДΩ)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer of the security officer stood up. He widened his eyes and opened his mouth and looked at him. He had already known the "old friend" who had known for eight years. Farmer. The sheriff came to Wat Xiazhen for eight years. Eight years ago, the sheriff of the town of Washu was killed by several gold diggers outside the town. The state government transferred a new magistrate to come over. The young man embarked on a journey like a swamp with his vision and dreams of the future, and was finally deeply trapped in this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those gold diggers have said that they have been picked up by another group of gold diggers for a reward of fifty dollars, but his mission is far from At the end, the state government told him that he could apply for early retirement when he was 45 years old. By then, he will gloriously leave his current position and receive the same pension as those who retired at normal ages, as well as enjoying the retirement benefits that others can enjoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are too many settlements in the western wilderness of the stars, too far, and even more terrible. Gold rushers, wild predators, robbers, and gangsters are a serious threat to the safety of the Western Sheriff. This is an impossibility. In addition to respect for the sheriff’s willingness to work in the West, it is also considered that once the sheriff is older and his physical fitness is declining, it may cause the gold digger’s desire to commit crimes, which is given by all western states. The sheriff is far superior to the treatment and welfare of police officers in other places, hoping that more people will contribute to the western society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheriff is now thirty-three years old, and he still needs to be here for twelve years before he has the opportunity to return to his hometown, perhaps this I can't go back in my life because he is married. His wife is a woman in the town. He has a family here, a child, and a very kind father and mother. To return to another world, I am afraid that he is not used to it. Even he still thinks that it is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, a turnaround has appeared. Once the public security official has made great achievements, he can take the initiative to apply for a transfer or retirement. This is also the welfare that the Western Sheriff has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most influential part of the West in recent times is something about the Freedom Front, which has slaughtered three mines and killed thousands. Some portraits have appeared in the night bar, and the state government has told them these sheriffs. If someone can make a merit, find a camp for the Freedom Front or grab the main personnel, they can retire earlier and enjoy the goodwill of the state system. You can also choose to go back to the bustling world and leave this damn west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheriff rushed out from behind the table. He smugly grabbed the collar of the middle-aged man in front of him. He almost asked his face and shouted: "You repeat, what did you find out?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer who sealed his neckline swallowed a bit, and some feared backwards, trying to make his face farther away from the guy, those with bad breath The taste of the sputum star made him feel sick, "I said that the gold digger who entered the town today seems to be the person of the Freedom Front..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheriff’s face Immediately, he showed an excited smile. After he let go of his hand, he paused for a moment, and he organized the neckline that was messed up by him for the farmer. He repeated "this is the case." He turned to the table and took his badge out of his chest and then prepared to call the nearest city. The city is more than 150 kilometers away from here. If they come over with a temporary manual railcar, it will take about two hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever these gold diggers know or don’t know anything, his credit is enough for him to leave this ghost place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's impossible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just after he called the phone and dialed two numbers, the action stopped again. He had some questioning eyes on the farmer’s face. How do you know that they are free-formers? I won’t bother me if I call this, but if they are not, you will have a big problem!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Then the middle-aged man told the sheriff that when he sat down at the entrance of the pub, these people said when they passed by him. They said that they intended to plunder the town. They need to find out if there is any hidden danger. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheriff pressed the farmer’s shoulder and said with emotion: “Everyone in Washu’s town will thank you, believe me, me. Call now, even if it is wrong, I will help you out.", after he finished dialing the last few numbers, it is not that the farmer’s words made him completely believe, but he felt that this is very Reasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the Freedom Front’s attack on the three mining areas has gradually deviated from the people’s predictions of this organization’s “small fights”, even the military’s initiative Stand up to the important task of preliminarily eliminating the Freedom Front. Under this circumstance, there is joint interference between the government and capitalists and mine owners, and cities around the world have begun to shrink the shipments of daily necessities and food. The commander of the Western Military Region has developed a very simple but effective strategy and tactics to force the Freedom Front to take the initiative to stand up and fight with them. Just like his predecessor, he forced the anti-government armed forces named "Blood Army" a dozen years ago. They are fighting the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method is simple, that is, no one is allowed, including any group or business that sells any food, medicine, and daily necessities to the Freedom Front. Every large-scale shipment requires an application and certification from both the supplier and the buyer, and will be accompanied by the military. The purpose of doing this is to push the Freedom Front into the corner, forcing them to go through dangerous walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this move is very effective, and as the commander thinks, after the rush, the Freedom Front will consider whether to plunder the village. small town. Once they choose to do so, they will completely expose their whereabouts, and the military will be able to quickly lock them and then destroy them. As for whether their looting of the village can bring danger to the residents living in the west? The answer is yes, but state governments and officials believe that these western cowboys will let those who are free-formed know what is called "the western part of the empire" in order to protect their lives and property. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This call quickly contacted the nearest city, and the military, the commander of the Western Military Region did not hesitate after knowing the news. I immediately issued my own order. Then the Western Military Region assembled a military force and rushed toward the town of Washu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Amon has returned to the camp two hours away from the town of Washu. When he returned to the camp, Fenlier greeted him. Fenrill knew that Amon was going to see Du Lin. He didn't interfere too much, just as he didn't like Du Lin and wanted to continue to interfere and control his future. Life is like that. But Amon didn't have the idea of ​​talking to Finrill. In his opinion, Fenrill was an unbelievers who were eroded by selfish desires. He was the devil who would sink to the bottom of hell. He would not People have too much involvement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the attitude of Amon, Finrill did not say anything further. He knew that the split of the Freedom Front had begun, and at the beginning, It is the moment of the end. These people do not believe in illusory things like pursuits, dreams, beliefs, they only believe in the weapons in their own hands, and the interests that exist in their own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to talk to him again?", someone asked Finlay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenrre shook his head, took his gaze back from Amon and turned to walk deeper into the camp. "Let him go, we are not all the way." It will be better if he walks away, at least now the purpose of all of us is unified. Let the following heads meet in my camp, we have to plan the next action..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
