			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr. Sail arrived at the parliament building, a large group of people had gathered at the door, composed of government officials, entrepreneurs, and some ordinary people and journalists. They are very concerned about the news that has just been heard through the big horn, and the federation has entered the state of war from the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people are not sure if this is a joke like a drill, or if the war really broke out. In the first and final year of the Cold War after the end of the Civil War, the Empire and the Commonwealth often had similar national exercises to prevent sudden attacks from the enemy. After Mr. Keller set up a communication channel for the two countries, the cold war that had just begun was over. The cautious and tentative contact between the private and the official gradually brought true peace. But today, the voice of the long-lost memory is ringing again. Some older people have begun to move their living materials into the cellar and tell the children not to leave home, even if they want to go to school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows what is going on, the war really broke out, and what is going on now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People need the right to know, journalists also need to report the truth of the implementation, just like their example Majeri reporter, tell the truth to the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Sail has not got off the bus, there is a large group of people coming up, his brow slightly twisted, and soon stretched out. A large number of senior agents and military soldiers wearing uniforms appeared outside the car, clearing a road to the gate for Mr. Sail. These people have guns in their hands, and any action that may be misleading is enough for them to trigger the trigger not only with permission. Ensuring the safety of Mr. Sail and other chairmen is the most important job in the country, although people do not believe that people in the empire will penetrate the federal government to assassinate national leaders, but this is something that has to be prevented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the parliament building, almost all the positions were filled. Mr. Sail and some officials shook hands and walked to the rostrum alone. He glanced back at the full conference room and patted the microphone with his hand. "Ladies and gentlemen, this is a bad news. I just had a hard time calm when I heard the news."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All countries in the world understand that war will not have any benefits other than pain and destruction, but the Yaoxing Empire has launched this war for its own sake, I Indignant for their actions, but also pitiful, poor stupid for them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the Yaoxing Empire insisted on using a war that brought pain and death to show its position, then give him a head-on blow and let them know that the federation could not be defeated more than twenty years ago, more than twenty years later. Today, the Federation is still invincible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless flashlights flashing behind the seats, and the unilateral undeclared empire of the empire has caught the federal unprepared. Although the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that this was not an undeclared war, they launched their offensive after declaring war. There are always some people who have some secret channels to get some news that ordinary people cannot know. The Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Lie. More importantly, the Imperial Army has now broken the border defense and is sweeping inside the federal government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this short hour, there have been a lot of things that make people feel regret and even disappointment. The first group army that has done a great job in the last war has always been They were all called "the squadrons" by the federals, but in the process of resisting the invasion of the empire, they only collapsed after thirty-seven minutes of defense. This is simply a repeat of the last war. Some people feel panic for this. What if the Imperial Army also drives straight into the federal hinterland? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailor actually knows these news, the three group army has already finished one and a half, the first line of defense has completely lost, and now the battlefield has been from the border Backward to the first city chain, a more tragic city battle is about to start. The Ministry of National Defense has urgently mobilized three group armies to deploy a new line of defense after the first city chain. According to the Ministry of Defense report, they intend to abandon several cities in the second city chain that are unlikely to be affected, and place them in these cities. After a part of the soldiers and a large number of mines, the main line of defense was placed in front of the other side of the line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three cities dominated by Yatoli are very likely to be the defense line for the next step of the Imperial Army. The Ministry of Defense arranges heavy troops while guarding the army. To prevent the next unfavorable situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up again and looked around again, saying loudly, "The peace-loving federation has reached a critical moment, and stupid and corrupt empires are attacking our city." Kill our soldiers, for peace, for freedom, for the life we ​​love, here, I call on the entire federal owner, actively respond to local conscription, pick up weapons, protect the country, and let the imperial people know that the sacred The federation is inviolable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To this end, I declare that from now on, the federation will enter a special wartime state, and all social resources will pass through the federal government and With the joint parliament, all individuals and forces who dare to violate the Constitution and passively treat the national defense policy and attempt to incite and destroy will be severely punished..." After that, Mr. Sail also said a lot of things, including The desire for victory in war, as well as warning some people and forces, do not make misunderstandings at this important moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of speeches made some people secretly happy, and some people began to be pessimistic. After the speech, Mr. Sailou asked people to ask irrelevant people. The next question was internal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war broke out and the current results made it difficult for Mr. Sail to clarify his own true thoughts. There is a happy part that the federation will be weak in the war. The authority in his hands, this is not a good thing after all, because the empire is invading the Union. I thought that the border defense line of the three group armies could also resist the other party for a period of time, but I did not expect it to be broken in less than an hour. In the report, the people of the Ministry of Defense believe that this has a lot to do with the emergence of some new types of war machinery in the empire, especially the medium-sized weapon-mounted platform, which is more stable than the past AT-1, faster output, and can be loaded with ammunition. More, the firepower is also fiercer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Sail has never thought of using war to achieve the effect of centralization or even dictatorship, but Du Lin made a financial tsunami by chance. Let the federal financial order collapse and society is in chaos. This gave him some inspiration, some motivation, and some new ideas. The previous establishment of the national and new generation consortia has maintained a restrictive conflict relationship because it is feared that larger-scale conflicts will affect the stability of the empire and the stability of society. At this time, these problems no longer exist. The society is already chaotic, and it is not afraid to be worse. Then simply use this opportunity to solve all the problems at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he really didn’t think that the federal army actually became so vulnerable, perhaps this is the time when the federal soldiers were lying on the credit book for more than two decades. For too long, and the reasons for the social atmosphere, in short, there were some mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Mr. Sail will not admit his mistakes, he will not call Magus to ask him why he does not play the script, after all, the last time there was no federal According to the script. He is very clear that if possible, the empire may not be faked. If it can destroy the Union, they will never be merciless. No matter what evidence is in the hands of Mr. Sail, it is worthless in the face of the destruction of the country. mention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the noisy people were asked to go out, Mr. Sail’s first sentence made people face discoloration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ladies and gentlemen, I think you should know the unfavorable news on the front line. I am very sorry about this. We have just experienced a financial crisis and now we are It’s a war. In the past, many troubles were not troublesome. Now it has become troublesome. The first thing we face is the financial problem. The war needs to consume a lot of wealth. Under the current economic situation, the government can’t get enough money to cope with this. The field doesn't know how long it will last. Even if the war ends in failure, I don't want it because we don't have the money to make bullets and shells to lose the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
