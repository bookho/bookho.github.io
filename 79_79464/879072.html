			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at it now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucho quickly rushed to the guy closest to him, the guy was robbing the bacon inside a deli counter, he snarled and screamed The man’s robbery moves, but the man is indifferent. He kept stuffing a roll of wrapped bacon into his pocket, not even watching Bujo. Everyone was crazy, Bujue punched his teeth and punched the guy's face. The guy looked back at his face with a sly pocket and looked at Bucho. The madness in his eyes retreated a lot. He knows Bucho, so he knows that this is a big man. He has a sly smile on his face. He pats his hands and walks back into the alley in two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people noticed that Buchao came, and the madness in his mind dissipated a lot, but some people didn’t care what Bujue was, still madly snoring. plunder. As some people have just said, the law will not have any trials for these people, and they are even more involved in this rare carnival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Bucho found a man in the distance holding a crying woman's hair while beating her head while dragging her into the alley. There is no doubt that as long as a man knows what he is going to do, Bucho rushes to the man while he is squatting. He must stop the riot, which is not only related to his fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a gunshot rang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who planned to rape the woman’s head slammed into the air, and the whole person slammed and slammed down. ,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman cried with her head sitting on the ground hysterical, and the entire city center was quiet at this moment. But in the next second, a young man threw a firebomb to a sudden emergence of soldiers, while some young people picked up the roadside stones or something thrown at the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only Bujo’s stupid eyes, even the soldiers were stupid, for the first time, it was the first time I heard that in the process of repression There are people who resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a voice screaming and screaming, "kill them, we will die if we don't kill them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This voice doesn't know where it came from, but many pockets contain other people's belongings, sticks in the hands or anything else, and the red-eyed workers realize that this is definitely not a parade. It is a riot, so the army will appear here, just to suppress them. For a moment they have a feeling of being deceived. Those who are familiar with them and who become talks in their spare time will happen to them. When they think that they may be caught and shot, these crazy people are even more crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless things that have been lost to the soldiers in an instant. After almost a moment of silence, the intensive gunshots sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cheers!", Du Lin raised his confidence with a confident smile, and the gunshots outside the window continued to reverberate in the city, although it was here. The time is already very weak, but everyone can hear it, it is a gunshot. At this time, I looked at Du Lin. Some businessmen had a cold sweat on their backs. They forced their hearts to shake their hearts and held up their glasses to meet Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a sip, he went to the window, closed the window, turned and shrugged. "It’s too noisy outside, we continue just now. Topic. I have talked with Mr. Maggs about some of the construction issues in the SAR. The Magnus leader agreed that I have limited trials of rules that are invisible elsewhere, such as casinos. My plan is to issue seven licenses. A licensed person can open a casino with an unlimited size, a small size, and no limit on the amount of the ticket. But there is a point..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raises a finger The eyes looked at these merchants very brightly. "The City Hall will set up an accounting firm and station in all the casinos to register all the incoming and outgoing accounts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Mayor, I have a question, what is the tax point for the casino?" Alexander stood up in the crowd with a huge stomach, like a standout. His stomach was exaggerated and he stood two people in front of him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Alexander not only bought a piece of land here, but also built two hotels. The initial plan is a 22-storey landmark luxury hotel. Visitors who are important to receive their identity are not able to live without money, but also need to have the appropriate status and identity. There is also a 19-storey upscale hotel that can be accommodated as long as you have money. The total investment is more than 28 million. The reason why he dares to play so big is that he has the capital to play so big because he mortgaged the land he bought to the imperial central bank and pulled it from the Ilyan side. I have a lot of investment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial central bank of Otis has finally survived the winter, and when it comes to spring, as the low price continues to rise, the president is said to have been crying twice in the office - he has not recovered the former real estate developers. The cost, the mortgage to the bank's land is sold cheaply. The central bank of the empire first praised his ability to recover some of the squeezed funds for the bank, and then reprimanded him and deducted his bonus this year, about 3,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there are still some real estate in his hands, and now he is not willing to sell, even if the price of the inquiry is high, he is not willing Sell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Alexander mortgaged his land to the imperial central bank, the president almost laughed when he slept. He prayed every day, hoping that Alexander could not afford the money. So that he can make a contribution to the central bank, maybe even a large bonus can be allocated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a problem. Fortunately, Doolin has a comprehensive plan. "75% of the casino’s operating income will be included in the tax. Within the scope, for every 30 million operating income, two more points will be added, and the maximum limit is 85 percent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duo Lin said Everyone took a sip of cold, and originally imposed a 50% special tax – that is, the smuggling tax. Everyone thought that Du Lin’s heart was really black. His appetite was really big, but it seems that they still Underestimated Doolin's greed. Eighty-five percent of the upper limit tax? Is it a joke that the Imperial Tax Administration has approved such a high tax? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people are thinking about it. If you can earn 10 million in a month, it seems that there are still two hundred and fifty 100,000 can earn! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of these merchants have been to the Federation and have been to some casinos in the federal side. They know that casinos are really a profitable industry. This thing seems to be completely ok! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander looks like a stupid one. After all, the fat man looks either stupid or bad. His huge stomach makes him bad, so he can only be stupid. He licked his lips, just like seeing the fabulous treasures, and asked: "Mr. Mayor, how do you get a license? Do you still need to bid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doolin’s auction of 200 million yuan in the Imperial City in the past few days shocked the commercial circle of the real empire. Many people think that this auction should be recorded in the textbook and become a classic “collective monopoly” case. Du Lin still controls this field, and at the same time he has not lost his control and initiative in this field, he has taken an amazing return of 200 million, which is completely a new "fraud model." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this kind of fraud mode is only effective for industry trusts, because only they can afford such games, as participants may be willing to be deceived, as long as they get tickets, it is worthwhile to spend more money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many people think that Doolin will continue to use that model to make them shopping, but what everyone did not expect is that Doolin took another One way to raise shareholders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven major casinos are not allowed to hold more than 5% of each shareholder in each casino. Once you own a casino, you are not allowed to subscribe to another casino. The equity, which means that a casino will have twenty shareholders with identical powers, which makes the capitalists in this room have a little turn to bend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The profitable business that can be eaten by one or two people, why should it be diluted to the majority? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually Du Lin’s preparation for the future. If the equity of the casino is on a certain person, once the person has some “accidents”, The ruling party is very likely to take back the casino and become an official self-employed, which is exactly what Du Lin is most reluctant to see. Yes, from the perspective of politicians, these casinos are more profitable from the official camp than the capitalists, but this is not conducive to the development environment of the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the city of Otis City has too much money and resources in its hands, it means that future successors have the power and the ability to rule the entire city. As well as the reshuffle of the forces, Dooling did not want to see such a thing happen. The city of Otis was a gold swallowing machine he built for himself. He could not leave such a big convenience for the latecomers, so he would change the casino. Into a network of multi-person cross-shareholdings, a network that cannot be opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each casino has 20 shareholders, each shareholder needs to take a certain share to exchange with other casino shareholders, which means that a casino may Implicated in forty or even eighty shareholders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to change the flag? It is possible to get 40 of the 80 shareholders and get another 60 or even more shareholders of other casinos to take back the operation rights of a casino. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an inextricable knot, and Du Lin firmly believes that there will not be more shareholders who are willing to betray the casino. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
