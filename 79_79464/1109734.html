			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Northern Continent has had two times of reunification history, and then gradually split, the most recent one is the most prosperous period of the Guar dynasty, the first king With ten heroes sweeping across the continent, it has laid a hundred years of glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the guar dynasty, which used force and torture to suppress all ethnic groups, was brilliant for hundreds of years. After the death of the first king and the first king’s grandson, the whole dynasty began. In trouble. The repressed tribes began to compete for freedom under the increasingly corrupt Wang Ting, and in order to ensure that the dynasty was not so fast, the rulers at that time could only begin to enlist some non-Guardian blood, the aristocrats. The Principality of Orex is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the demise of the Guardian dynasty, the king of the Principality changed and claimed to be the king. The Ogildins did not object, but responded positively. Their actions, with thorough repression, wiped out the traces left by the Guart dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the Principality of Orex is called Hezrett Olex, which omits many titles, referred to as Hazlett. He looks like he is over sixty years old, with silvery hair and a chubby figure. He is well maintained, at least with red light and no wrinkles on his face. In the capital of this small country, he met Du Lin. He already knew that Doolin was carrying the money. When he saw Du Lin, he was very kind. He took Du Lin’s hand and traced his ancestors and Guar. The relationship seems to have forgotten that his ancestor Oleks was not a loyal aristocrat at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We all have the same cultural heritage, and even the blood of the Guars in my body!" Hezlett said very kindly, "My ancestor's companion is the Guar nobles. We are also a family. You don't have to be restrained. You have to be as free and relaxed as you are at home.", for the money in Du Lin's hands, Hezlett It can be said that these words were said in a shameless manner, which made some ministers around him look at other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, after all, the Orleans Principality is poor, the country is not big, but it is close to the Federation, how can it be rich? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Orex, there are almost no heavy industry companies, and light industry enterprises are also very poor, mostly to meet the more common daily consumables manufacturing, There are many industries that have been replaced by industrialization in the empire and the federal government. This is definitely not to preserve what civilization, but to be poor and backward. The national economic pillar industry of the Principality of Orex is the agriculture and animal husbandry. The annual output of food and livestock will be acquired by the federal government. In order to let Orex continue to go on agriculture and animal husbandry, the federal government has also issued a “quality”. The country of agriculture and animal husbandry gives the country of Oleks that their products are quality products, and the price of the acquisition is slightly higher than the normal price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a small improvement, the citizens of Orex are very satisfied with the present life. They can import things they can't produce from the federation at relatively cheap prices, and some prices are even equal to the cost. Then I was able to sell my things to the Federation at a higher price. There is nothing more relaxed than the current life. In short, no matter whether you buy or sell, you will not suffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nationals don’t know, but Hezlett is clearly clear. It seems that the federation is a very good friend, but they have been through such mean means. Control everything in the Principality of Oleks. They are not allowed to develop technology, not to industrialize their industries, and to maintain a relatively primitive social production system. They are like captive animals. Of course, in addition to holding his nose and recognizing it, there is no second way to go. As long as Hezlett has any fresh ideas, the federal adjustment of the tariff and then change the policy, the nationals of the Orix public will pick up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the stupid king and the evil ministers angered the benevolent federation, made our life difficult, or just a referendum! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Principality of Oleks who was forced to "freedom" and "civilization" has become the biggest joke! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal financial tsunami is simply a super disaster for the small Principality that relies on the federal economy to live around. Almost all orders are lagging behind. These small countries are no longer Know what to do. At this time, let alone financial aid, even if it is a donation of three or five million, it is a good thing for them, and it can solve a lot of troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such a situation, Hezlett’s enthusiasm can be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin visited the palace under the leadership of Hazelett and visited the only university in Orex - more outstanding young people will choose Going to the federal level to pursue a higher degree, staying in the country is a representative of people who are not motivated. Of course, the education popularization of less than 20 million people in the whole society is actually a problem. Sometimes the only national university recruits fewer than 300 freshmen in one semester. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, Heizlet also opened a press conference, highly appreciating the critical moment in the Principality of Oleks, an internationalist spirit The entrepreneurs who came to the Principality of Olek may bring more new changes... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is that the case? Why do I always feel that I have been used again?” Du Lin said with a smile at the bright sunshine outside the window. It is already subtropical. Although it is still in December, the climate is relatively pleasant and not so cold. . Today's weather is good, there is no cloud, and the sun is shining on people's warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is talking to Magus, and Margus also knows about this press conference, and immediately after he learned the details, he gave it to the Principality of Oleks. The ambassador made a call and the call eventually went to Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus is still as simple and neat, "I am using you, you are also using me, the role is mutual." He and the cabinet have a short time After the meeting, I decided to use Doolin’s plan to “cruise” and intend to push the Yaoxing Empire to the path of an international superpower. In fact, the federal program is very good, and now they can't use it. Why don't you take it for yourself? Good things don't have a sense of shame when copying, just like copying the homework of good students. When there is an A+ in the homework, will you feel shame? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course no, not only will not be ashamed to tell parents, see, I got an A+ on the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there must be some changes in the implementation process, Du Lin just can be used as a link to connect these countries and empire, to use Du Lin to open the relationship, and then It is more appropriate to talk about aid and diplomacy. Even if there is a problem in informal diplomatic work, it is also a question of Doolin. Du Lin cannot represent the country, but the country can represent Du Lin. When the country really needs to come out, the empire will come out. The advantage of doing this is that it is not very aggressive, and the Federation has just been sinking in the financial tsunami. It is not so good to see the empire come out to steal it. Instead, this kind of informal diplomacy is more appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no big opinion on this Du Lin, as Maggs said, the empire is using him, he is also using the empire, complement each other, the benefits Only more! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I got a title here or something...", Du Lin asked a very clever question, the empire group always took his farmer He was born and said that he was not a nobleman who could not give him the greatest assistance. In fact, he did not refuse to become a nobleman. It was just that the people of the empire were too dark, and all of them were calculating him. He was not suitable for stepping into it for the time being. But if you can take a slant from this sword, can you open a new situation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
