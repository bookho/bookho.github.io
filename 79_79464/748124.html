			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea was not inspired by Abbien’s sudden inspiration. For the past six months, he has been paying attention to the Progressive Party’s news, from the very beginning. The armed conflict with the old party, to the armed demonstrations behind, it is clear that only people need to push a forward party will fall off the cliff, but they actually magically come over. Not only did they shake hands with the new and old parties at the negotiating table, but they also qualified to participate in the election. If the Progressive Party does not come to chaos, it is very likely to become the third largest party in the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is always the right way to change the status quo. Abigail undoubtedly pointed out the right path. His spokesperson can indeed make money and has a little status. But he is not satisfied. He can't afford to spend money, obviously can go to the fourth district but in order not to leave these Guars have to nest in this worst fifth district. Why is he doing this? Is it possible to continue to turn the Guars into resources in their hands? Still not in order not to leave the masses? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two days he talked about this with a hacker, the hacker for Abigail to point out what he needs to do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step is to establish a higher image as soon as possible, so that everyone knows that there is an Abien in Irian, who is happy and living for his compatriots. The unremitting struggle of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second step is to form a more convenient and efficient small group, to develop and spread this small group, organize the backbone, develop the backbone and improve the organizational structure. And then recruit more people to join this organization with a clear name, charter and purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third step is to strive for the inflow of funds in the society. It is best to set up the industry by yourself, strengthen the strength of the group, and actively demonstrate the benefits of the organization to society. Contribute to help some people or the government solve some troublesome things and gain positive influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 4, applying for the establishment of a party, directly transforming an ordinary organization into a party, then all members of the organization become members of the party, and they will naturally pass Maintain the interests of Abbey to protect your own interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hacker is very succinct and clarified about the benefits of building a party. Once the party is established, Abigail’s personal influence and appeal will rise. The government also has to give him important channels such as higher social status and equal dialogue power. By that time, Abien’s status and power could be instigated without money. He could even unite the entire empire of the guates, build a strong party, and finally step into the highest hall and take the scepter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hacker’s words said that Abigail was so excited that he couldn’t help himself. He had already imagined that the day would come. He would stand on the steps outside the palace, holding his scepter in his hand and accepting congratulations and surrender from everyone. . He will be the first Prime Minister of the country to be a Guar, and he will also become a leader who will lead the Guarts to a strong future. He will be remembered by countless people in the future, and even the children’s textbooks will remain. About his life and his deeds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a big man, I have been carrying a sacred mission since the day I was born, I am the gods and the first king to save all my compatriots. Messiah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at the companions around, Abigien took a deep breath. "This grass and the people sitting on the grass this evening will Will be remembered by history, because of our greatness, so the Guarte talent has won a sacred victory!", his level of culture is not high, although there are many ideas in his heart that you want to express, you can make a sentence It is inevitable that there will be some deviations, but this does not prevent the Guart people with the same culture from surrounding him from understanding his meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time people’s breathing became so fast that no matter what Abid’s description could not be achieved, first they saw the benefits inside. As promoters, they will inevitably become important figures in this party or organization. Even if they can only complete a small part of what Abien said, they will earn. There will be no changes in doing and not doing them. There is nothing left, even if you lose, where can you lose? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that in the numerous successful uprisings in history, the epic of the epic history is always the bottom of those who have nothing to lose and no need to win or lose... .... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is still a sentence behind, but it is still not good at this time in this atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The companions all expressed their willingness to follow the footsteps of the leader Abien and struggle for the life of the Guar. Listening to the voice of the companion's mouth, Abigail was a little bit swaying. He forced himself to calm down a bit and explain the task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hacker’s words can’t be remembered, but it’s probably the same thing. “Let’s have a good relationship with you. Let’s erect the party first. Then I will find ways to expand our influence and let the society and the empire recognize us. The future must be bright, so we must double our efforts here, please!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it is not necessary to have high-level and high-quality speeches, as long as they can impress people's hearts. Even if the preface is not followed, it is an exciting speech and a successful speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abien sent his companion, no, not a companion, a subordinate. He thought about what to do next and walked toward the house. It is not far from where he lives. He walked through two intersections. He didn't like everything here. When the party was established, he would definitely move to the third district, or even the second district. The brain was in a messy plan for the future. When I got outside the house, I subconsciously pulled out the key and opened the door. I closed the door and dropped the jacket on the shoe rack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife has not returned yet, he played a little heavy, the bruises have not completely dissipated, and there is no one in the family. He didn't turn on the lights. He lived here for so many years. He clearly knows where each piece of furniture is placed. Avoid all the furniture in the dark, throw the keys on the coffee table and lean against the sofa. He patted his cheek and wondered if he would buy two slightly more decent clothes. He scratched his slap and was a little itchy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the lights are inexplicably bright. The sudden switch between darkness and light caused Abigail's pupil to shrink to the extreme. His eyes were bright and a glimpse of a figure. He cursed his wife in his mouth, but he was in a good mood today and didn't plan to practice boxing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he blinked and his eyes adjusted to the light at this time, the whole person was stiff, like... a wax figure. There was a lot of sweat on his face, falling down drop by drop, and the ticking drops on the ground. Two children, who appeared to be only twelve or three years old, stood three meters away from him and held a pistol in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, man, is it wrong, I am Abigail, do you know Abigail?", in the face of the threat of death, Abigail actually took up the courage, half-slung and moved halfway forward, slowly reaching out. "Everyone knows Abigail. Did your parents not tell you who I am? And you guys Around, there is no money here, we are all poor, the poor should not find trouble for the poor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved forward halfway, three meters away In the moment, only two and a half meters left. His other hand slowly inserted into the pocket and slowly took it out. There were a few fifty-dollar coins in his hand. "Hey, I only have so much money, you are all Take it, but don't hurt me..." He took another step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
