			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing a number of intersections, when Du Lin took a car to leave, a large group of people stood on the street to watch him leave. In the eyes of these people, there is a long-lost color. The sky seems to have cracked a gap because of the guy named Du Lin. The colorful color breaks through the thick black clouds and falls into the human world. A dazzling light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s gaze came back from the rear windshield of the car. He sat up straight and sorted out his clothes. Today he spent a lot of money, but the money must be spent. He remembered that in his own dreams, he had seen many people of all kinds and great people, and one of them said that he was very impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a professor, specifically what Professor Du Lin is not very clear, but Daxu respects him. After a tea party, the professor said to Daxie: When building a building, people take all possible and impossible accidents into consideration, so they will build the grandeur of the building as much as possible. The construction is sturdy. Whether it is an earthquake, a tsunami or a flood, even if a meteorite falls from the sky, it is not always possible to destroy the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if it is destroyed internally, it only needs to be slightly damaged in several important links, and the whole building will collapse at a speed you can't imagine. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, Du Lin’s deep impression of teaching these words came from the desire to destroy, and he wanted to try it out. The professor said that only a few points need to be destroyed, and a strong building can be destroyed. But at this moment, what he thinks is indeed another thing - power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The architecture he describes is not exactly the same as today’s society in this world? The framework and rules of the Yaoxing Empire have been implemented for many years, and will be revised and reinforced every year, even if it is not long before the Great Patriotic War. It is very difficult to destroy this huge "building" from the outside, then from the inside? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, as Du Lin promised, what he wants is not to change the dynasty, he does not have such ability, he is very clear. What he needs is to establish his own rules on the original framework and belong to his own internal architecture. His identity, his blood, is his building materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who wants to charge toward a higher place must be fully prepared. The Guars belong to a minority race in the city of Tener, with a small population and a very poor population, but they have a strength that others do not have – they have been forced into desperation, and this is what Du Lin needs. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t tell lies, he will lead everyone to happiness together, but only if they are his “family” or “self” "! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also suddenly understood why Heidele supported him to create a fellowship and was willing to fund him because Heidler needed this force. . There is a fable in the ancient legend of the Guar people, called "The Sea of ​​Mars." Of course, this is not to say that one of the other world's celestial bodies floating in the universe is a colliding Mars. This parable is about the story of a bustling city burned by a Martian in the oil mill in the context of the mythology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tner City is the oil mill, the Guar is Mars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s eyes lit up, he closed his eyes, and all of them immediately let the driver who was driving the car slow down some speed. He knew that Du Lin should be What I thought of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did Du Lin think of? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of something deeper, thanks to what he saw and heard in his dreams, and gradually he could gradually use it one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the empire has not recovered from the vicissitudes of the Great Patriotic War. It is said that there have been anti-government armed forces everywhere, actively wanting to reinstate or Independence, the empire that has been almost beaten is even more exhausted. In the political arena, the new faction shouted the slogan of the constitutional monarchy, overthrowing aristocrats to the ground, and even the emperor had to choose to make concessions to the sudden political tsunami. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the most important thing in this environment of internal and external difficulties? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether they are known as the aristocratic forces of the old party or by the people as the new party’s innovative forces, they also want to have a stable environment, and they The essence of the contradiction between them is also to solve the current chaos and remove the drawbacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guar in the city of Tener is not much in the whole empire-based environment, but it is a very insignificant part, but in the city of Tener, although it is a minority, it is also a force that cannot be ignored. No one has integrated them before. First, because the feudal system itself is more careful about dissidents and more cruel treatment, even if someone has such an idea, they dare not do it, and no one dares to respond. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the lack of a person who can become a leader. Although Heidele is rich, although he has a pivotal position in the upper empire of the entire empire, he " Not reliable." As a descendant of the traitor, and now the distinct class gap, he does not have the basis for the integration of the Guar. Among the groups that can be accepted by the Guarts, there are no people who can lead them out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreamer may have, but the dreamer will never become a trend, and it is even more impossible to lead the trend, just like a cannon in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he, Du Lin, was an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a descendant of a farmer, or a poor man. He is not much different from thousands of ordinary Guarts. Through his own efforts, he has improved his life environment and changed his own destiny. Naturally, he will become a benchmark, a guide, and eventually become a trend-oriented person. Heidler saw these things in his body, so he was willing to support him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking of this, Du Lin’s thoughts about the future are suddenly clear, and the whole of Cannes is based on the city of Tener. So much as to radiate the entire empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car quickly disappeared at the end of the street, the crowd slowly spread, but many people's eyes flashed with dazzling light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Dudu called the door of Doolin’s room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Cedore may have been innocent, he should be careful, he still lives in a house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;揉 揉 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , He opened the door and looked at the Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
