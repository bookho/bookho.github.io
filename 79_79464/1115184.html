			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major filmmakers really took a lot of thoughts to hold Kinsale, and the reason they are willing to cut the meat is still in Du Lin. Not to mention the impact of cable TV on movies, some producers have now targeted the film in the direction of cable TV. Du Lin made the “pay-on-demand” system from the beginning, which made all the major players see a trend different from the current mainstream big screen. It is unreasonable to divide the current big screen into film dealers. A movie released at the beginning of this year was released for fifty days, with a total box office of 4.7 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this box office is already very great, at least most ordinary people think so, but in fact, the filmmakers probably have a hundred and fifty Tens of thousands, after removing the cost and the cost of issuing propaganda, earn hundreds of thousands in place. The real big heads have taken the theater away. By the way, the largest theater in the empire is now in the hands of Nasha, and both the theater and the TV are family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A movie sold millions of box office, and the last filmmaker earned hundreds of thousands. Although there is still tape and the surrounding area to play a little bit of heat, it is not too much income. This is also the reason why filmmakers have been crazy about new films. If they can't build more revenues in quantity, the survival of the company will become a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now, something that might become another huge source of income was born, and that is paid on-demand. If there are one million home-paid on-demand per movie, the cost is about two dollars, which is two million. After paying taxes with the TV station on the 5th and 5th, the profits they earned can even be equal to the income from the cinema. The extra income of a movie is equal to revenue, and the net profit may be more than twice, or even three or four times. Because this part of the income does not need to eliminate various costs, this makes the filmmakers very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then naturally, Jinsel will be promoted. When Jinsel is used as a link, some things that are not very talkative can be discussed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls are talking about some of the interesting things happening in Kinsale and the recent film circles. Suddenly there was some commotion at the welcome, the girls stopped. The conversation was curious and I suddenly widened my eyes. The girl wearing a visor looked at Su Rui in an incredible way, and even the words became stuttered. "You...you invited Kinsale?", saying that she squinted and returned, almost Screaming, "God is on, I didn't expect you to be such a Su Rui, how much did you spend and how much relationship you found? I heard that Suri rarely participated in such commercial activities..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating in the wedding is also a way to generate income for the stars. Some big people often hold some cocktail parties or charity evenings, especially the latter, which requires a certain number of people to increase their influence for the party. Of course, there are still some people who are on birthdays. When they get married, they will invite some big stars to come, so they have to pay a lot of money. As for what is worth not worth, it is another matter. In fact, this is the distress of the poor. For the rich, it is just spending money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suri is very reserved and smiles. In fact, her mind is also a little confused. She stroked a few girlfriends who are eager to move, and took the skirt to go to Jinsai Merlin’s conversation with Merlin’s arm, very lady’s courtesy, “Hello, Miss Kinsale, I am very honored to invite you to my wedding.” She did not see Merlin. But I was shocked by Merlin’s social circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that she is looking at Meilin’s current social circle from scratch, and when he knows who knows, She has never heard of Merlin actually knowing Kinsale. A faint sense of crisis has come to mind, and the rumors of the female stars in the past seem to be vivid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kinsale glanced at Suri, couldn’t help but hold Merlin’s chin and looked at it. This move was a bit sloppy and made Su Rui’s expression Some are not very good to watch. The next two people's conversations made all the hidden dissatisfaction on her face a sincere smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your kid is lucky..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin made a step, a little embarrassed to avoid The curious eyes of the people around me, "Well, my sister, don't make trouble, I am getting married today!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is his sister! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on Suri’s face is even more real. She can’t wait to show her heart to Kinsale and tell her, oh, all my smiles are Sincerely, there is no falsehood. She can even imagine that she will also have access to a day in the film circle. Maybe there is still a chance to make a small character in some movies, appear on the big screen, and maybe even become popular. Famous star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let those little girls envy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Suri let go of Merlin’s arm and took the initiative to take Kimsel’s arm and screamed her sister kindly. “You are definitely tired all the way. There is a prepared lounge here, do you want to take a break?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kinsale glanced at the watch and shook his head. "Wait a minute, Du Lin said he will come soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin...Mr.!" Su Rui’s eyes sparkled with some kind of brilliance. It was Du Lin’s words that led to today’s wedding. She is not sure that this is a good thing for her life, or a bad thing, but it has enabled her to realize the dream of a dream of a high society. It is almost every girl's dream to join the giants. Especially at this moment, when she was standing in Kinsale, she had already begun to learn what the real high society life was like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin sighed and sighed. "I told him, if you are too busy, you don't need to come over...", he didn't tell the truth. He didn't know why, a little scared of Doolin. This was not the case at home in the past. He and Mason often teased Doolin, and the relationship between the three brothers was very good. Perhaps this is related to their older age than their younger siblings. This may be the legendary generation gap, and the generation gap makes their relationship better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being talking about Du Lin, there were two commercial vehicles outside the church. This is also the “farmer model” that started to sell in the second half of last year. For a long time in the past, the business car did not have a separate name. People prefer to say that it is a mini-box truck, which can accommodate more things than a car. This is very suitable for those "farmers". But last year, the accident was that the business car became inexplicably popular in the first round of hype. Every car company started to launch its own business car, which also made the business car appear more and more frequently in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were nine people in the car. These nine people were wearing black formal suits and sunglasses. They left four people at the door and others entered. Searched inside the church. Many friends and relatives who came to see the ceremony did not understand what happened. A car that was not eye-catching slowly stopped at the door. The door opened and people made a slight exclamation. The mayor of Nano Lindes smiled and got out of the car. He sorted out his dress and took the initiative to Merlin. "Hello, Merlin."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin was a little surprised and took the initiative to reach out with Blair, "Hello, Lord Mayor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bellen looked at the crowds in the church, nodded and greeted him, standing not far from Merlin, he glanced at the watch and then looked at Kinsale, "If I didn't guess wrong, , Miss Kinsale?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's nice to meet you!", Kinsale reached out and grabbed Breren. She was also surprised that Blair actually came to Merlin's wedding in person, which is an incredible thing. However, Du Lin’s influence is also reflected from the side, far exceeding their estimates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellen and Kinsale’s hands were at the touch of a finger, and he looked at Suri with a smile on his face. “So this is today. the heroine, Ms. Suri "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;? & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Surui Jiang endured the emotional heart, restrained trembling hands, do everything possible to maintain their modesty, she Slightly bent, "Yes, Lord Mayor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary standing behind Brendan took the initiative to take out a gift, Brendan slashed I glanced at it. "I’m in a hurry. I don’t know if I have a gift. You don’t like it. If you don’t like it... then I have no choice.” He smiled and asked the secretary to send the gift. This guy is actually a very He is also a very interesting person. He was born into a noble family and received a good elite education. He had never had the chance to be a party to the party. Later, Du Lin killed the former mayor of Nano Lindes, and then let the family of Blaine. I found a place to settle things through Harry before others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He learned the unfortunate lessons of Todd. After he took office, he often ran to Otis, and his relationship with Doolin was also good. His performance was stupid. But if you really think of him as a fool, that is the real fool. After ruling Nano Lindes, Blair is well aware that the city has lost its former glory. If it is almost impossible to catch up with the city of Otis, the only way is to change the existing socio-economic structure. Turning the preference for light industry entertainment to the main industrial structure. With the guidance of Doolin and the help of Harry, the development of Nano Lindes is still OK, and it is already one of the industrial cities in the middle of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he heard that Du Lin’s brother was married and Du Lin was coming to the wedding. He immediately canceled today’s itinerary and came to see Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the new party or the old party, whether it is Du Lin’s friend or the enemy, has reached a consensus that Du Lin’s bastard is very rich now. Money is like love, it is about to overflow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can dig one or two projects from Doolin, at least half of this year's development goals can be completed. For political achievements, it is nothing to take a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
