			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the squatting room, the leader of the free front line sat in the corner and smoked a cigarette. This is a large detention room. In order to protect and monitor these dare to assassinate the empire. The gang members of the senior officials asked the police to give them special treatment to ensure that no accidents can be made until the end of the incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the free front line is Darcy, thirty-seven years old, and sighed with a sigh of relief. This time he was able to stand up on his own initiative because there was a big man he knew telling him that he must kneel down. Although he may face a relatively long sentence, he can certainly be released in advance. At that time, he not only got a huge sum of 500,000, but the other party would send him away from the empire and find a place to settle him in the federal side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, if someone else speaks, he has long refused, but the gentleman who opened the mouth is very energetic, and the other party ensures that Doolin will not kill him. Then he agreed to this. But after the promise - precisely after the phone was hung, he regretted it because he knew who he was going to face, but it was an underground emperor who spoke on the East Coast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all developed cities can see the church of the fellowship, which is not a religious organization at all, that is, a gang with a religious organization. He knows the power of these people and knows how powerful Du Lin is, so he regrets it. He has already asked to transfer him to the inland city for detention. The "power" of the inland Doolin is not as large as the East Coast, and he will be relatively safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who made him feel a little sorry is his brothers. Fortunately, he will kneel down on his own, and his little brothers will soon They will be put in jail, it is not to harm them, but to protect them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he took out another cigarette and continued to smoke, the iron door in the detention room opened, and several police officers took the hood and left. Come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was suddenly shocked, and then a smile appeared on his face, wearing a headset, indicating that he had to transfer, which made him relieved. He didn't want to face Du Lin's bastard, he still wanted to live a few more days. He took the initiative to meet, did not notice the stiff expression on the faces of these policemen, and asked softly, "Is it necessary to transfer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police saw him After a while, I nodded and said, "Yes, I have to transfer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on, I know the program." He took the initiative to extend his hands and let the police handcuffed him. He also lowered his head and let the police put a black headgear on his head. He asked a little strangely: "Why is there no hole this time?", he refers to the hole in the hood, which allows him to observe the surrounding situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police returned to him, "Do you want others to know that you have transferred?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He listens It was concluded that the policeman’s tone was not very friendly and he immediately closed his mouth. Although his brothers were reluctant, the boss had already stood up and left the incident. He also said that he would benefit them afterwards. They were reluctant to cooperate with the police and put on handcuffs and hoods. A group of people grabbed the shoulders of the people in front and walked out of the shackles in a faint vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Thomas, the man has arrived." The police chief originally intended to say to Du Lin, but Du Lin raised his index finger in front of his lips. Under the spur of the moment, the name of Colonel Thomas was spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas nodded and asked a team of soldiers to take these people into the transporter. Du Lin shook hands with the police chief before leaving. "Thank you very much." Your understanding and cooperation, I deeply apologize to my brother's rudeness..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where can the police chief let Du Lin apologize, how dare Accepting Doolin’s apology? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clasped Doolin’s hand in both hands and swayed hard. “It’s me who should apologize, slow down the mayor of Doolin, if there is any need in the future. "You can speak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin patted his shoulder, nodded and turned away, watching Dulin’s departure, police chief Take a sigh of relief. He rubbed the sweat on his forehead, turned his eyes and looked at the policeman in the police station, and whispered: "You don't have to work? Send something, work now!" After that, I turned back to my office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that he may be a little shameful before he belongs to the following, but he knows that there is no other way to do this. He offends those big men and he may lose his police. Cap, but offended by Du Lin, he will only lose his own life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the car, Du Lin handed Thomas a cigarette, and they got together and lit the cigarette. After taking a sip, Du Lin smiled and said: This time I am in trouble, otherwise it is not convenient to mention people from here." The reason why this trip is so smooth is that there are two reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Du Lin’s reputation on the East Coast is too loud. The most terrible thing is that he does not violate the “law” of any place. All his actions are legal. Whether it is winemaking or selling wine, he has Corresponding documents and licenses, and obtained permission from the city of Irian. Everyone knows that this guy controls the largest private liquor market on the East Coast, but no one can take him. On the contrary, some people who are against him have disappeared inexplicably, and even the richest man like Juan has fallen into a suicide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Thomas and the soldiers became the last straw to overwhelm the camel, the police chief at this level has been able to know the inside story of some navies, in case these people In order for Du Lin to dare to shoot, he died and died in white. He said that the black pot would still be thrown on his head. The empire had a headache for the Navy, and they would not let the navy, which had been out of control, go further from the core of the empire for a police chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Thomas did help Du Lin's big deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas just smiled. "We are friends, aren't we?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin He pointed to him, "Yes, we are friends, just as I have something to say to you." He reached out and shook the window. Thomas didn't know what he was going to say, but he also shook the window. "Minor How many years have you retired?" Du Lin turned to look at him with a serious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas’s heartbeat, a tsunami-like surprise instantly destroyed his intellectual defense, he wanted to keep his expression, no matter how hard he tried, lips They are constantly shaking, and then gradually become a smile from the heart. "Yes, it is less than two years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any thoughts on this position? The naval base is stationed in the Major General!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muscles on Thomas’s face began to beat uncontrollably, he resisted The urge to growl, took a few deep breaths, "How do you want me to answer?" The more you do, the more calm you are. He doesn't want to let such a good opportunity slip away from his own hands. It may take decades to wait for the next opportunity! He can't wait that long, he just wants to seize the opportunity now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled, "Relax, Thomas, this is just a very simple question, we are friends, aren't we?", Thomas nodded hard Du Lin continued: "So as a friend, I naturally hope that you can go further. What do you think of the name of the younger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close, it is already close! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas can feel that the opportunity is already in his palm, he just needs to slowly gather the five fingers, slowly, can not be anxious, and then firmly grasp This opportunity. He was silent for a moment, and the voice suddenly had a little hoarseness. After coughing twice, he asked, "What do you want me to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, grab, go to the operation!", Du Lin's voice is very firm and bright, "I will take at least two million for you to operate this matter, and the younger will return to my foundation as honorary director after retirement. With me and his help, your chances are much bigger than others. Let go of it, I believe that you know how to help you achieve your dreams!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happiness comes too fast, like a tornado, the Thomas of the volume has some slight dizziness, he holds the forehead. "What do you want from me? I know no one will help for no reason." Another person always has some reason to say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at Thomas kindly and spread his arms. "You are talking very much. Yes, but I don't want you to do anything, we are friends, I just do my duty as a friend. And I hope that our friendship can continue, and that's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are a Major General, you may rebut Du Lin’s request at this time. ", and will show gratitude and zero, must commit to help Du Lin unconditionally in his own terms of reference three times as a reward. Hey, you help me once, I will repay you three times, is it enough? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Thomas is just a salesman, an excellent salesman, he still does not understand that the world is even more terrible than he imagined. All politicians don't have too many friends, because the friend's duty is not so easy to do! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin, I don't know what I should say, but please rest assured, I will always remember this moment, and will never forget, we are Friends!", Thomas's extraordinarily moved, almost let him cry, Du Lin's image instantly became stalwart, and there was a warm glow around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two embraced and eased Thomas’s emotions, and then Du Lin talked about it with him on how to become a Major General. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
