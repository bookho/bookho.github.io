			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire is not as simple as what people have seen. Behind this calm, there are many unknown things that have happened and are happening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Magus, Du Lin is a touchstone thing. If those juniors don’t have the ability to step on Du Lin, then simply let Du Lin stepped on their upper position, this empire, always to continue... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not know when he returned to the Imperial Capital, because of his own reasons, the New Party leader and the old party leader also discussed him in private time, he wants now What you do is pay the ticket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, there are a total of seventy-five dollars in documents, we accept cash, checks and telephone transfers, you see if there is time...", The little policeman is not afraid of Du Lin at all, which is related to Du Lin’s recent renewed refreshment of his image in front of the society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not able to let people know him because of fear, fear is the limit is anger. He must reverse the bad impressions and influences he might have left on people, package himself as a socially responsible entrepreneur, and a caring politician with love, charity and fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things are very useful, the money is spent, the effect is reflected, the little policeman is not afraid of Du Lin, watching this little policeman only in his early twenties It looks like a freckle on the face, and the red face is like a fruit that has fallen through the ground and is about to rot on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doolin was writing a check, the little policeman was in a police cap and asked a question, "Mr. Doolin, you feel that wealth is coming for you." What does it mean?” He saw Duolin’s action pause and immediately added, “I mean I am a poor person. I can’t understand what kind of mentality a person has when he has a lot of money. I am very curious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked up at him and smiled. He continued to write the unwritten check and then caught it between his fingers. As a matter of fact, "Fortune is no longer a demand for me, but a resource that changes society to make more people happy. Is this answer satisfactory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The little policeman checked the check and collected it. He did not go to the bank for verification. First, it was because he needed a deposit to get a cash check. Secondly, he felt that it was impossible for Dulin to open a blank check. It is not this identity. What people should do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is some gap with my imagination. I thought that you would say that the money can make you feel happy... Although there are some official voices, thank you for being able to answer my questions.", the police officer smiled at Du Lin. Laughing, "Now you can go see your friend and take her away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded slightly and turned to the detention room behind, small The "friends" in the police mouth actually refer to Melissa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that the little girl came to the Imperial Capital after getting the permission of Doolin was to take her girlfriends and friends everywhere, Du Lin, including Natiya is not worried about the safety of Melissa, because the cars of Doolin are almost bulletproof, and the most unfortunate is also specially modified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of worrying that Melissa was injured in a car accident, it would be better to worry that someone else would be hospitalized if she was hit by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not long before the emperor arrived, Du Lin received a notice from the lawyer, he was punished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that the car under his name has stayed in the no-stop zone for a long time, and there have been two red light violations and one accident that damaged the public property. This is to thank the empire for not inhumanizing how many points each driver gives each year, but in another way to promote people's impression of obeying the law - fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually learned from the federal government. The federal penalty for non-criminal liability is very interesting. The first penalty per year may be as little as three or five dollars, but the first On the second and third occasions, it will continue to accumulate according to a certain base. It may be that the penalty for receiving the punishment for the tenth time is one hundred yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such horrific economic sanctions have made more people understand the need to comply with the regulations. After all, if there is no money to pay the fines, they will go to jail, for example, they will almost be Melissa, the prosecutor, she wants to thank Du Lin for being more timely, otherwise she can only call Natiya, which is definitely not a pleasant experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doolin saw the little girl, she was sitting in the corner of the detention room with some anxiety, because the vehicles she was driving were registered in the name of Doolin. Next, so the police gave her some preferential treatment, and took the initiative to inform Du Lin's attorney Adams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When standing outside the door, Du Lin just knocked on the door. When the little girl looked up and saw Du Lin, she rushed to the door, separated by cold steel. I can see that she seems to have cried, and more than once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police in charge of supervision opened the door of the detention room. After the girl came out, she kept her head down and walked behind Du Lin. "I don't know what I did, no one told me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s footsteps, Melissa also stopped. “Dear, ignoring your own responsibilities without knowing such reasons is not something an adult should do. Your God has given you a lot of precious qualities and wisdom. This is to give you the courage and ability to take on your responsibilities and to understand the mistakes you have made, instead of letting you find excuses to escape these. You understand my Does that mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa didn't talk, Du Lin continued to move, and the little girl followed him. Before leaving the gate of the police station, Du Lin heard the sound of crying behind him, and Yeyeyeye’s several sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t care about her. When he got to the side of the road, Du Lin got into the car. The little girl thought about going up, but Du Lin closed it one step ahead. The door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Du Lin with tears and tears, did not understand Du Lin’s meaning, but Du Lin smiled and held out her hand, in the palm of her hand before she was arrested. The key to driving the vehicle, "I believe that after this incident you will understand what can be done, what can't be done, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...", Mei Lisa looked at Du Lin with some help. "Do you still let me drive your car?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders, "Why not? You have received enough lessons because of your own mistakes. I think that you have grown up in this lesson. I also believe that you will not make the same mistakes next. Do you think I am right?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, yes, sir!", Melissa quickly took the key from Doolin and repeatedly thanked Doolin for her generosity, then drove One of the few sports cars in the Doolin garage disappeared into the traffic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local president’s nephew blew a whistle and said with a smile, “Mr. Doolin, it seems that the girl has not grown up.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also smiled. "One day...", he paused for a moment and ended the topic. "Go to the Royal College, and arrange someone to stare at her. Don't let She is in great trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability of a 16-year-old girl to be in trouble is actually similar to that of a boy. If she is indifferent, she can give her a hole in the sky. After scheduling the next thing, Du Lin closed his eyes for a moment and he needed a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo did not come back to him this time, but instead went to Orodo, he needed to explain to Mrs. Vivian, why Fred Will fall into the pit, and also showed a very happy attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels that her son may have undergone some unknown changes, and they have not told the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it was only a small accident. The three children found a natural small pit and dug deeper, and stole some cow dung sheep. What is filled in, then spread the branches and straw, ready to kill others. This group of little bastards never do anything good, and all the residents of Ziwei Town have long experienced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be some of the branches that they used to cover the hole. When the dog was tested, the dog did not fall, then the two The children began to encourage Fred, who is bigger than them, to go and try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fred walked up very responsibly and jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That day, it was the day when Mrs. Vivian went to Ziwei Town to borrow Fred to go to school... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Timamont family bought a house next to the Royal Academy for the convenience of Ophelia during the Royal College, and two days of the Royal Academy To start school, Ophelia is now living here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl was a little shy when she saw Ophelia again, but more of it was a surprise and a sense of happiness that could not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took out 10 million to set up a foundation called "Aphelia Angel Charity" to promote charity, the annual foundation Fundraising and 50% of all aspects of profitability will be used for charity, which has made many people who are caring people pay attention to this foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, this is the first charitable foundation in the empire to be purely charitable and caring, and to a certain extent has opened up a new field. Naturally, it will attract a lot of attention. At the same time, the name of Ophelia was spread throughout the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
