			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ship's side, Du Lin blew the sea breeze and looked at the boundless sea. The farthest point of the eye, the line between the sea and the sky will be both Separation, if not so carefully, perhaps the whole world is blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Du Lin used to take the boat often, especially during the Irian period, his relationship with the Navy was very good, sometimes he needed to go to other places on the East Coast. It is far more convenient to find a boat by yourself, and it is safer to find a sailboat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the relationship between the Navy and the military has always been bad, the military has also cut off military spending, but they always have some way to get a lot of money to maintain With the current size of the Navy, there are even one or two small-scale military exercises every year. Du Lin, a blood vessel that transports blood to the Navy, is now not only a good relationship with the Navy on the East Coast, but also a very deep friendship with the Navy on the West Coast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agricultural products and some ore from the west are directly pulled by train to the port on the west coast, and then the materials are thrown on the east coast. It seems that this seems to increase the cost of transportation and prolong the transportation time. What Du Lin has harvested from it is definitely not a measure of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major General Thomas - This guy has officially got a whole set of things awarded to him by the Navy headquarters, and the appointment book has come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said in the West when he met Du Lin some time ago that the Naval Headquarters will be a high-level gathering at the end of this year, and will be hoped at the Navy headquarters. Dooling can take time to attend the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is now one of the most important money bags. If others are ordinary branches of blood vessels or capillaries, then Du Lin is the aorta! Every year, he spends about 8 million to 10 million yuan on the navy. Perhaps for the entire navy, the money can only sustain a large naval base or two to three medium-sized naval bases. How many military bases? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the money is gone, the Navy’s top executives will also have a headache, as Du Lin’s “To Perfection” series of agricultural products opens in the high-end consumer market of the Empire. After selling, Du Lin will only pay more and more for their transportation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not some people have been stuck with a certain line, Doolin even wants to send more money to the Navy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investment period of this investment is long and long, but it is definitely worth it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you thinking?", Natiya walked over to Doolin, leaning back on the ship's side, the sea breeze blowing her hair, she left the empire After the land, I felt an inexplicable ease. "Is it considering federal matters?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at her and smiled and shook her head. He is considering his next layout. This is actually a very interesting thing, similar to "I have a big power that is earth-shattering, but I won't tell you, even if the highest-ranking principal doesn't know" emotions, it is very difficult. Share it to others because others don't know why you are so happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret of hiding in my heart is a very happy time, of course, sometimes these secrets will also bother people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the place in the far-off Haitian line and thought about it. "I was thinking that if one day I couldn’t live alone, I should You shouldn't wear a diaper...", Doolin laughed first. "You know, that thing is not comfortable when you put it on. What's even more annoying is that whenever you need convenience, you will feel a fever in your buttocks. "Nattiya endured the forbearance or did not hold back, laughing and swaying, Du Lin still said, "What is even more annoying is that it will become very wet and cool after the heat, it feels terrible." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you always so humorous?", Natiya suddenly became curious about Du Lin, Du Lin is not like she knows Those big men, who maintain their best image whenever and wherever they appear, are in front of people. They don't laugh, and occasionally there may be a little bit of humor, but that's definitely not to make people happy, sometimes it makes people feel embarrassed. They rarely laugh and scream like Du Lin. They are like the most obedient disciples, keeping their own dedication to their careers and their interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not the same as them, completely different. This is the type of "big man" that Natiya has never seen before. He doesn't seem to care at all. His own image, speaking very interesting, when he needs it, the things that come out of him are enough to make people breathless and frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that he can give people around you a sense of security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pressed his elbows on the handlebar of the ship's side and looked at Natiya sideways. "I like the beautiful girls who are happy and laughter. It is the most beautiful thing in the world, even the things that God wants to marry!" "Natya suddenly felt a little hot, and she panicked her eyes away from Doolin, and she had something she was afraid of." At that moment, when Du Lin said such a romantic and moving words, she actually had such a hint of incitement from the bottom of her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insane impulse, for a moment she was really captured by Du Lin, she even had a shameful impulse, this impulse is only in the past, She only had it when she was young. That kind of abandoning people's secular ideas and moral constraints, just want the impulse of madness. At the same time, she had some embarrassment. She was already married. Although Walter had some things that hurt her, he apologized. In addition, she has children, cute little girl, has been in the ninth grade, she is no longer the young she, she has no crazy capital, the world is no longer her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment of heartbeat was pressed by her in the bottom of my heart, my eyes looked at the clouds at the end of the sky in the distance, and fell into silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most feared person is the comparison. What is more fearful is that there is a clear tendency in the process of comparison. At one time, Natiya’s heart is chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and turned into the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya will enter his core level, Kevin said very right, if he can not abandon some narrow nationalism, his future path will be very It’s hard to go, not even to go. But if he abandons these and returns as a hero, then he will get more than he imagined. In terms of interests, a controllable Natiya is a decision he must make. On the other hand, there are not many women like Natiya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very gentle, Du Lin likes her voice and the way she talks, and the attitude, the gentle voice can warm the heart, she also Have your own insistence, be a good girl... It’s a little older. Stronger professionalism can help Du Lin to do a lot of things. Her network of contacts in the South Commercial Bank is also a fortune. It is necessary to know that the most developed area of ​​the imperial economy is in the south, where Du Lin is bound to get involved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, I like this mouth, who dares to say? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for marriage? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the future, of course, he also needs to think about it, because after this time, someone will start to consider accepting him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After four days at sea, the ferry finally landed in the Federation, and Buddha once again proved that some people can play their teeth in the river and become sea. The correctness of soft-footed shrimp. From the moment of boarding the ship, from time to time outside the door of the Buddha, you can hear "vomiting...", "wow vowing..." and the sound of screaming in the smashing, hard work, and there is still a lot of time to be on board. After spending time, he will spit and vomit and will eventually get used to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Mr. Keller greeted and sent a son to follow Du Lin and his party, Du Lin and his party passed the customs very easily, they were not even Checking your passport is simply something that most people can't imagine. But the real society is so interesting, many things that are impossible in the eyes of ordinary people, it always exists, but the status of most people is not high, and there is nothing in the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the port, the two young people immediately ran over. They stopped at the time of five or six meters from Doolin and bowed. "Hello, Mr. Albert arranged for us to pick you up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert, who used to be in Irian, every morning when Doolin was relaxing in the cafe The guy who did not bother to sell things, his perseverance and perseverance touched Doolin, and he had half of the Guars' bloodlines. At that time, Du Lin decided to accept him and give him a chance. It turned out that he was a successful talent. He seized the opportunity and then Du Lin arranged for him to do things in the Federation. There have been people during this period, and more than a group of people are staring at him. After all, the money in his hand is a large number, from different forces, and definitely can't go wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did a good job, and Doolin didn't mind giving him a whole new opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people got on the bus. Most of the people who came here came to the Federation. They didn't have any curiosity about the Federation. Du Lin looked at it more. It is completely different from the empire, more free, more enthusiasm, and more cruel. Money is the only pass here, but it is just that this kind of thing has always been in the hands of a very small number of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
