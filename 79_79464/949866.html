			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Mayor, Mr. Vitor wants to see you!", the waiter stood at the table and bowed respectfully, on the edge of the table. People are not rich and expensive, and there are even more special characters like the mayor, who reveals his most perfect smile in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the waiter and said "I know, thank you". After that, he did not pick up the napkin and cleaned his actions. Instead, he continued to work with him. The people talked, "The whole profit of Otis will have a slow downhill for a long time. The reason for this process is that I think everyone in the room is also very clear." He finished speaking. The guests at the table nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic effects of the city of Otis in the past month like an explosion cannot be maintained for a long time, and the delicious and delicious food will have an annoying day, people Need to "cool down" and let the passion go to calm. After spending the winter, the economy of Otis will recover and go uphill. The guests sitting at the table are investors from the city of Otis. They agree with Doolin’s point of view and nod one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin manipulated the knife and fork to cut the fish steak in the plate, which is a fish from the deep sea. According to some biologists, they belong to the fish. "Dragon" class, with the dragon's lineage, as to why the dragon will have a relationship with a fish that may be more special, and broke the reproductive isolation and made such a strange fish who can not tell. In short, even if the mythical story is introduced as a real thing, there is no need to care about what the fish is, just consider its price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fisherman, who is about two dollars a pound by the sea, sold a super-high price of nine dollars and a half pound in the city of Otis. Although the price is very expensive, many people like it, just like some not expensive steaks can sell at the same price in areas where there is no pasture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So in the next period of time we need to find new economic growth points and keep the momentum of the rapid development of Otis, I have an idea...", he will The crispy fish pieces that are fried in the sauce are stained in the sauce. They are wrapped in the mouth and chewed. "My plan is to go public!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually It is very, very elegant and impolite to say that while chewing food, the airflow ejected from the lungs during the process of speaking may blow some meat out of the mouth, and it is also very unattractive. But no one pays attention to it. They are all concerned about the word that Du Lin just said - listing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling swallowed the food in his mouth. He put the knife and fork back on both sides of the plate, leaned back, took a cigarette from the cigarette case on the table, and a businessman sitting next to him immediately He sent a fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cigarette was lit by the flame, Du Lin licked his mouth and spit out a smog, "We will pack the city of Otis!", he once again slightly detailed When they explained their ideas, the investors at the table suddenly came to the interest. The act of packing a city into the market can be said to be unheard of in the Western world, but it has not happened without it. There aren't many guides before the first time, and there are always people who have to take the first step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We, including those who have not come, and all members of the Otis business group, can subscribe for a portion of the equity, and then we follow the city of Otis Based on the revenue and profits and taxes, the city of Otis is packaged into a company, a group company, and then promoted to go public. I think everyone can understand the benefits of listing...", Du Lin said here on the table The guests laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, they are very clear, listing means that their value will grow exponentially in a very short time, they will also be the first benefit The identity of a person gains a lot of attention, reputation, status, and wealth. This is a good thing for everyone. They have no reason to refuse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Once the city of Otis is listed as a whole, it will definitely be favored by the investors, and we have more money to develop the city in a short time. Developing your business. I don't know if you have heard of it, the cabinet intends to set up a new SAR, which threatens the status of the city of Otis, and we will face more challenges. Copying the 'Otis mode' is not In an empty talk, after the establishment of the new SAR, if we can't go far beyond them, we may face the problem of economic recession."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out The fingers tapped on the table and made a duoduo sound, making everyone's body more straight. "This will hurt the interests of all of us, so we must do everything before things happen. "Measures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When planning the city of Otis, I think this is a city of entertainment, so that everyone who wants to find happiness can be here. Find the happiness that belongs to them. The location of Diss is very special, located in the hinterland of the empire, it can be said that it is very close to the center, which is our advantage. For the entire empire, we are all recent! So we must strengthen our advantages and characteristics, Do not give anyone the chance to overtake us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In the future, I will plan three new districts. These three new districts will become a source of happiness for bigger, more complete, better and many more. And this is why we need to go public, we need more Money to accelerate development..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin talks about his own vision and development of the future of the city in the restaurant, outside the restaurant, dirty Vitor waited at the door. He can actually find a place to buy a new dress, which is not a money for him. However, he did not dare to leave. He asked the waiter to convey the request that he wanted to see Du Lin. The other party did not respond. He did not say that he was allowed to go in, nor did he come out immediately. He knew that Du Lin was looking at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he leaves this time, what if Dolin comes out? He didn't know where Du Lin was going next, and he didn't have much time to re-finit Du Lin. The bicycle that Princess Fergie was placed on the train smashed for more than 30 kilometers, which made him exhausted, and Miss Ferrika was still waiting for him to bring back the power of the rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he can only stand here, he wants Dulin to see him from the restaurant, and see him standing here, this It is the best way to find Du Lin for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This station, stood for more than an hour, standing on his legs seems to have lost consciousness, Du Lin took a group of people out of the restaurant. When he saw Doolin, Doolin saw him and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin made a stunned look and walked toward him. "I am very sorry, we just had a very important meal, I forgot." You are outside. Why, what happened?" He looked up and down at Vitor, revealing a smile with a look of excitement. "Mr. Vitor, have you encountered a robber? Why are you so embarrassed? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du...", when Vitor was just about to make his own request, he discovered that his nephew was very, very hoar, and there was The burning sensation of the tear of the strand allowed him to release the next syllable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go get a glass of water and let the poor gentleman run his throat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After taking the water from the waiter's hand, he took a sip. He smiled and thanked the waiter and took a deep breath. He bent down slightly and said: "Mr. Doolin, our train derailed more than 30 kilometers away... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin interrupted him rudely. "Is Ms. Felika injured? What is the situation there? What do I need to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vitor didn't expect Dulin's reaction to be so big. He stumbled. "Miss Felicia is not injured, but I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's too good If the noble lady is hurt, I am afraid that even God will not bear it!", Du Lin walked over to Vitor and patted the dust on his shoulder. "You continue, what do you want?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Constantly interrupted by Dooling to give Vitor a feeling of being insulted, because interrupting others in the education of the nobility is a very special act. On the one hand, as an interrupter, his behavior is very impolite. On the other hand, it also shows that the interrupter does not respect the interrupted person at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As everyone knows, he represents Miss Ferry, and Miss Ferrijia represents the Fatima family to a certain extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He snorted, his face was more humble, his torso and his legs were narrower. "I hope you can reach out." The hand helps us to get out of the current predicament!" When he finished speaking, he stared at Du Lin’s expression. He thought that Du Lin would find a reason to reject his request, or drag on a time, but he did not think of it. Du Lin actually agreed to it, and decisive people can't believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, I will arrange it right away!", Doolin let the investors take the first step, then he transferred a construction machine from the joint construction worker. I also brought two trucks with some very common things like food and some utensils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What made Vitor even think that Du Lin also personally followed and went together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about three o'clock in the afternoon, Du Lin met Ferguja. In fact, she has reorganized her instrument dress with the help of the maid, but the wolf is not finishing the hair, and it can be eliminated by tapping the clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Du Lin personally came, Felicia made more determinations about her heart. She smiled and greeted her. This time she did not mention her own skirt. But stick out his hand, "Now it's even!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
