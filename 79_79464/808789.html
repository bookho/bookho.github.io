			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin finally returned home after a round of the East Coast. This time tens of thousands of bottles of wine were sprinkled and not only paid for the money, but also paid a sum of money. Not a small tax. For this reason, he and the City Hall made a little bit unpleasant, because the price of these wines is "too cheap". Yes, it is cheap. This is that the mayor feels that he has been played by Du Lin. In his knowledge, these wines must be sold for at least 20 yuan a bottle, and Du Lin’s profit should be around ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What people didn’t think was that Du Lin reported a ten-dollar cost, but the price was only fifteen, which means there should be three More than 100,000 profits and taxes have become only a hundred thousand, and they are half lost! The mayor told Scott and Doolin to say this. Du Lin said that he was the price, and also faintly revealed that the wine was sold to "friends", so the price would not be too high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I didn’t get the answer I wanted, the mayor’s adult could only recognize his nose, and half of it was half lost, two hundred and fifty. Ten thousand, but there are more than one million, which is also a huge income. But after this incident, the mayor’s adult had left his mind on Du Lin. After Du Lin wanted to fool him, I’m afraid it’s not that easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than a month of sailing, Doolin finally returned to Ilyan, and at this time, Irian was already in the winter, and there were almost no pedestrians on the street. This is the winter break of Irian. Compared to Montreux, which is close to the Federation in the south, the climate there is much warmer than Irian. Even at this time there are more than a dozen degrees of temperature, and many people go there to find fun, it is still very lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the biggest difference between Irian and Monter, the first is temperature change, and the second is industrial change. Irian is a pure tourist city, Monterey is also, and Montreux has another industry that is also very developed, that is, the red light district. Compared to other places, Monterey's red light district can be described as a red fruit, and absolutely has nothing to do with "subtle". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Premiere?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freina came back from school at night, and Du Lin talked about this. The post-production of the film was completed during the time when Du Lin was out, and the reservation was held at the Imperial Palace on December 12. At this time, the eighth district has been completed for a long time. The core of the entire film circle defaults to the Imperial Capital, so the premiere will also be placed in the Imperial Capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first actress and producer of this color film called "Irian Love", Freina must be present in person, and she wants to call Du Lin together. The first is to deepen the relationship between myself and Du Lin, whether it is a cooperative relationship or other relationship, and secondly, I want to warn other people. She is now behind the gold master. Don’t put those thoughts that should not be thought of on her. Body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the film "Irian Love" getting closer and closer, many people have thought about the heroine of this movie. Watching movies, how can you be more vocal when you watch a movie and behave like a heroine in the movie? In addition, Du Lin, including Freina, did not explicitly disclose the "relationship" between the two. Some of the richest brothers frequently called Freina and wanted to invite her to dinner. It is best to sleep together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is even more to ask her how much money she wants directly on the phone. I have a chance to open a price and then I will pay for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This phenomenon is not uncommon in the film circle. Many female protagonists have become the targets of the rich and hunter because of the popularity of a movie. Woman, how can I bring a popular actress out to get a head? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena looked forward to watching Du Lin, she very much hoped that Du Lin could promise her, but Du Lin shook his head without thinking about it," I can't do this. I haven't had time to go to the Imperial Capital recently. I am very busy, do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not busy, but does not want to challenge the "those people" sensitive The nerves. Since he knows that these people have touched his little tail, he will no doubt have a provocative meaning in this time. Think about it, those people can't wait to get him to the emperor to interrogate immediately, but because there is no way to force Du Lin to take away from Irian without evidence, he took the initiative to go to the emperor, this is not to send Going to the door? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire’s judiciary hangs on fairness and justice every day, flaunts itself as a messenger of justice, a bright apostle, but sometimes they do things specification. Just making up a small problem is enough to drag Du Lin to the emperor and can't leave. This kind of thing is not without it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena’s disappointment was overwhelming, she opened her mouth and finally chose to keep silent. In this period of time, no one can change his thoughts, except for himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly thought of something, Freina said: "I heard that Juan is back, he was determined to be implicated by others, has been released without guilt. I heard that Irian is back today, there are still a few people to go Pick up at the station!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin, I didn’t expect Juan to return to Irian, but it’s not impossible to think about it. In the aspect of the development and cooperation of the cinema, Du Lin pitted him once, or said that his mind was not purely taken by Du Linkeng. This does not mean that his previous work is equal to white, nor does it mean that those who spend it. The money is completely gone. This is not the same as financial investment. Financial investment may be due to various "accidents", and people who do business never have a bloody return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is not worth anything, as long as it is a thing, there will be value, just the value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like the stock market, unless it’s a stock like DreamWorks, even if the stock falls to the lowest, it’s just a loss and a loss for the stockholders. "Bankruptcy", unless it is to find someone to borrow money, or take a usury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan invested more than 5 million in the front and back of the theater, and now it can still be worth two or three million, not to completely lose him. Even if it is said that, he does not know how many times more than the assets owned by ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He didn't come to me?", Du Lin put down the knife and fork, picked up the napkin and dipped his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena shook her head. "I don't know the specific situation, just listen to people talking about it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and got up and left. In the bedroom on the second floor, he picked up the phone and called Alexander. Alexander had a good relationship with Juan. One was to do the hotel industry, the other was to supply drinks, to have a cooperative relationship, and to be local rich, and the feelings were bigger than others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin asked about the matter about Juan, and Alexander said with a lamented voice: "He’s also fell a big head this time. I hope he can cheer up." There is a feeling of incomprehension in his words, and the facts are true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Juan was arrested, his negotiations with the George family stopped, assets were frozen, people were scared, and it was said that they were very embarrassed and thin. A circle. The things in his hands are almost clear to everyone. In addition to the movie theaters purchased at a premium, there are about fifty or sixty empty spaces in their hands. This is actually the advice that Du Lin gave him. He bought the land first and then slowly built it. It was not a lie when negotiating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now these lands have become a problem. At the beginning, Juan only followed the thinking put forward by Du Lin to make up the "quantity", and circled a lot of land in some second- and third-tier cities. When he bought it, he didn't care about the development and construction problems of those cities. When the sale was over, the problem came – no one was willing to take over. Spending money on buying a piece of land in a city that is underdeveloped like a country, it is better to add some money to a developed city to buy land. At the very least, the latter can appreciate quickly. The former is not a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 5 million investments can recover more than 2 million. Thank you very much, and it is estimated that there is still some that cannot be sold, plus the money he owes to the bank. There was no hope for it, and the cooperation with the George family was lost. This time his loss was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a friend of Juan, the imperial central bank’s Irian branch president James has provided him with as much convenience as possible, if he can’t lend in January As well as interest payments, his things will enter the process to start the auction. Where did he get the money in a month? Usually he and the rich in the city are good friends. If the capital turnover is difficult, then everyone can help. Now he is a crater, how much money is not enough to fill in, who dares to give him money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional farmer couple asked Juan to return the money to them immediately, now Juan is overwhelmed, even more terrible is that he can’t get money this month, he The villas that live in are taken away by the bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A decent and wealthy man has become nothing near bankruptcy in just half a year, which really makes others feel the impermanence of fate. Three months ago, Juan was still full of spring breeze, and even many people were envious of him, but after three months...not to mention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin and Alexander hang up after a few words. Although he is very tired now, he still has something to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to Juan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking a shower and changing a suit, with Dufo and Airlis, the three went to the villa in the first district of Juan. When the car arrived at the door of the villa, it seemed as if a dark cloud was over the villa of Juan, a bleak atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ringing the doorbell, the butler greeted Du Lin, and Du Lin waited for Juan in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
