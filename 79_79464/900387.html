			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Mayor, I am the new president of the Workers' Union Otis City Branch, Bryant, very fortunate to be able to get your interview. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian is a male who looks like he is in his early thirties. He has no special features and has a blue chin like the most workers. There is also an inch of scar. He has brown hair, is not short, looks clean and direct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers’ union was finally completely dismembered into three parts from the practice of Magus, the Workers’ Union Administration Department, the Workers’ Union Legal Department, and the Workers’ Union. The Ministry of Labor, with official involvement in all three departments, is no longer a purely workers' organization. In fact, this is not quite true. Official representatives can only exercise supervision and cannot control the daily work arrangements and actual work of the trade unions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some things that are not accurate. The two-track system itself is for a system that can maintain a good attitude and continuous work, but some people will always pass some methods. Drilling holes and gaining more power from it can not be said to be common, but it is not uncommon. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the main knife-claw of the workers’ union, the first thing after Bryant took office was to visit Doolin, and now the workers’ union has A consistent view is that the president of the city of Otis is not so good. I accidentally provoked Doolin, and maybe something broke. However, they cannot fully use a listener to be the president of the club. They also want to retain the final dignity of the workers' union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Bryant was sent over. This is a branch with a "position", he is a member of the New Party, and actively engaged in some society. activity. He had been refrigerated for a long time because of his "position". The purpose of enabling him now is to let him come to the drowning of the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the amiable person, Du Lin didn't mind releasing his goodwill. He reached out and Bryant and shook him, then invited him to sit down. "I listen." I said that your internal elections have just ended. I didn't expect you to come so fast. I just have some work that you need to cooperate with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said when the election Bryant’s face flashed a bit of awkward expression. The Foreign Workers’ Union declared that the election was going very smoothly. All the workers’ representatives were very enthusiastic and support the election. This is a very fair way to determine the highest leadership of the workers’ union, but in fact This process is not as harmonious as it is reported in the newspaper. All kinds of canvassing in the dark and in the end are endless, even his marginal people have several people who have stuffed him money, so that he must vote for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of the election, it should have been a public election vote. As a result, the door of the headquarters conference hall was locked in less than 30 minutes. The outside people did not know what was happening inside, but as a worker representative, and owned Bryant, who has the right to vote, knows that there is a fight in the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some senior workers’ representatives have a lot of contacts in the guild themselves, and some of the seniors left by the president after he was forced to resign Very interesting, the competition has become very intense. In particular, when a worker’s representative expressed his wish to become the president of the conference and all the participants, and how he would change after becoming the president, a senior executive could not help but stand up and question his program. And used very dirty words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of the conference became fierce in a moment. At the beginning, the cups and shoes, and soon the chairs began to fly, the whole venue was a mess. In the end, the workers' representative class, through its strong physical fitness gained through years of work, defeated the top of the trade unions who only sat in the office, and let a worker representative from Gallen Rut succeed in getting that position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there are dozens of people abstaining from the publicity vote. They don’t want to abstain, but their bodies can’t support them to continue voting. Stand to the hospital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said that when he talked about work, Bryant immediately expressed his determination and position. "Please tell me, within my scope of work." I will do my best to help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... you are a little embarrassed to say this." Du Lin’s face is not the slightest. Sorry expression, but the atmosphere is really good, he said with a smile: "I intend to apply for a labor certificate for all workers and brothers in Otis. You should know that there are a large number of migrant workers in each city, which strengthens the prosperity of a city. At the same time, there will be some uncertain factors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the construction of the city of Otis, it has happened in more than three months. More than one hundred thefts occurred almost every day. In the five years before the construction of the city of Otis, there were only two cases of theft. We need some means to manage and monitor these migrants, of course I There is no discrimination Not only is labor, all who live in the city of Otis, will have such a proof "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;“Residence certificate, ID card... and more proof, only then can I better manage the city and make the market more orderly.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Bryant listened very carefully. He didn't interrupt Du Lin's thoughts. After Du Lin finished, he asked: "So what should we do? This may encounter some minor troubles, really The participation in the management work can be found that the working class is not as well managed as imagined." In some cases, he must first clarify that even if it is a little shameful, it does not matter if he does not have ventilation first. Dooling’s plan was aborted, and maybe this stick would hit him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The majority of the working class are the bottom of the society without culture. Their legal awareness is weak, their character is rude, they lack knowledge and conservation. So we will encounter many kinds of species. Possibly, once someone stands up and does not cooperate, plus the spread of rumors, it may play a negative role." There is no doubt that if the workers are asked to apply for an unprecedented labor certificate, this will make them put some bad Things are associated with themselves, such as slaves. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the imperial monarchy, there was a sign on the slave's body with the name and teeth of the slave, as well as the name and contact of the slave owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought for a moment, "I will let some workers take the initiative and let the business people in Otis give them higher treatment, which may solve Your confusion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case, then there is no problem at all!", Bryant also remembered that Du Lin recruited a group of Guarts. Come to work, there are more than 50,000 people. If the group can get a labor certificate and get the benefits, then the rest will not need him to do the job. At the same time, he also realized that this is a good opportunity for him. Once he can apply this set of methods proposed by Du Lin to the entire imperial workers, it is helpful to restore the former credibility and prestige of the workers' union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how to do it, think again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin discussed some details with him. For example, after the resume of the worker is also part of the labor certificate, Bryant has offered to leave. He felt that Du Lin had nothing to say to himself. It was better to let Du Lin "please" himself to leave. He came here to do a good job of service, not to pursue the sense of existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
