			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natalie’s departure really made Dulin’s work busy, and he considered who should pick Natalie’s class while he was I didn't need the work he was dealing with. He has not had much time to pay attention to things outside of Otis, but outside of Otis, a thing that has not affected the ordinary people, but has changed an industry is quietly erupting - killing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;killing itself is not a trivial matter. The reason for being quiet is that these killings are often outside the eyes of people, never reported, and no one It is circulated outside. Occasionally, one or two drunks will talk about this, and they will soon wake up and shut up on this topic. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifteen wine merchants who received the patents granted by Du Lin, have been trained in Stan's, and have begun to use distillation purification to produce high spirits. At the same time, they also began to clean up the private brewing workshops around their sphere of influence. Whether or not they use distilled purification technology, as long as they are unlicensed private brewing workshops, they are within the scope of their clean-up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short period of time, the entire private wine industry is filled with strong blood smell, a large number of workshops disappeared overnight, and some are reluctant to give up their current trading. But they have all disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Du Lin hopes. He hopes that someone will replace the whole industry to rectify the whole industry and maintain the purity and institutionality of the industry. He gives The rules set by these fifteen companies will also become the rules of the entire industry. An orderly industry can make more money than a disorderly industry, and the risk is minimized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rule not only plays a role in high-alcohol brewing, but also gradually spreads it to the low-alcohol sector. Each region should follow Du Lin’s “ideal plan” has a workshop where you can make a high-alcohol, and of course these are your own. There are also three workshops that can make low-alcohol wines. After all, the market is very big. Du Lin and the people he authorized can't swallow it in one go. They use a cooperative approach to acquire, invest, and hold shares. The source of most regions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to monopolize an industry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to hold the source, you can monopolize the industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like the George family's monopoly on "news events," it is like the giants in Doolin's dream that have control over the resources and sources of the entire industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, they have already done a part, and are still doing the part that has not been completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, all wars are unlikely to be one-sided. During the Great Patriotic War, the Federation once reached the city of Otis, only two hundred kilometers away. The distance can destroy the core of this empire and declare the demise of an empire. However, these few hours have become a desperate road for federal people to suffer for centuries. The Imperial Army tore the supply line of the EFF in an almost suicidal offensive, and the Imperial Army was already insane in the face of anger and despair in the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They surrounded the main force of the EFF in the radius of about 50 kilometers around the city of Otis, and they could not find any supplies, and finally forced the federal government to go. At the negotiating table - the federal government is not worried about the lives of the soldiers. They are worried that if the soldiers die, the government will have to pay a high-priced pension, which may drag the federal government's finances, so they compromise. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire then took back all the invaded land, and the federation also found a face for itself - the tariff right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war in the private wine industry is actually the same. In the course of the war, some authorized companies, families, workshops have encountered More than one assassination, two of them did not let the children of the choir sing the sound of nature for them. This has also made the killing between each other more intense, and has already caused some people to be dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has a little bit of trouble, and should stop this 'war' immediately, so the war of no honor can only discredit our face.", inside the new party In the high-level meeting, Bowworth clicked on the name of Doolin. He glanced at Magus. Magus smiled at him. This smile made Boavos tickle. "According to local statistics, More than 7,000 people have died in this industry war so far. We are civilized, gentlemen, please take note of this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baowo Sis’s expression is very serious. This is in line with the image of his party’s whip. As the party of the ruling party, his power is still not small. He can not only supervise the election of the imperial parliament, but also interfere with some disciplines within the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Du Lin said that the patent is someone else's, he only got the authorization of the patent person to be responsible for the patent. Which one of you is not the old fox who has been immersed in politics for a long time, how could he not know the so-called patent person? But it is a firewall he placed in front of him. In the event that the patent goes out of business, he can push his responsibilities all the time, and the cost of the authorization is transferred to the "authorizer" account, and he has no relationship with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed not done well, and the killings of those people are almost overwhelmed. It is said that there is more than 30 years in Batu. The historic brewery was destroyed by an authorized capitalist, who had placed explosives in the capitalist's factory, causing dozens of casualties. Although the caliber of external propaganda has been unified and handled in accordance with security incidents, this is a bad sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these people who are excluded from the industry by Du Lin eventually no longer choose to be silent, when they choose to break out, there will be many social problems. Citizens will lose their sense of security, which will have a bad perception of the local responsible party and affect the image of the New Party in the eyes of the imperial public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether Bauvers had tried to attack Magus or Harry with the help of Rennes, only he himself knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the completion of Bowworth, there was some noise in the conference hall. People have long seen Dulin’s dissatisfaction, and at the same time, the most people feel Interestingly opposed to Doolin is not the politicians who were born of nobles or businessmen, but the politicians who were born in civilians. They are the people who have the most opinions about Doolin, and they are also the most resistant to Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​this group of people is actually very simple, they have their own efforts, even the sale of personality and dignity to have the status of today, for the power of their hands They have experienced the pain and suffering that many people can't bear, and they succeeded. To the world, they showed the empire the great power that the Empire Dreams embodied in them. Each of them is the elite of society and the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many civilian high school students from the Imperial Royal Academy, but now, a guy who has not attended school, and is still a smuggler, actually got the attention of Magus. They are richer, more entitled, and more promising than them. How can they accept this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Du Lin is a nobleman, they will not say anything even if they are declining. This is the son of a farmer who is riding a horse. The guys who are full of mud in the fields are already riding on their heads. If they can accept Du Lin, how can they be worthy of their bitterness and dedication for more than ten years or even decades? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
