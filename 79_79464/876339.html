			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas apologized and smiled at the woman on the bed, stretching her thumb to the doorway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman is not his wife. As a star officer of the Irian Naval Base, he has raised several steps for the income of the base, so he was given some privileges by the Major General. For example, you can be "visited" frequently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman sat on the bed in a slow-sleeved dress, until Thomas was a little impatient and took two dollars from his pocket and stuffed it into the woman’s Mariana Trench. At that time, the woman who wore the skirt immediately picked up the clothes and left the room. She also helped Thomas close the door very intimately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you think about asking this question?", Thomas took the phone and walked to the door to open the door, watching the woman leave the house before sitting back At the bedside, "The Major General will know the deputy commander of the warning zone. If you need help, I can tell the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Navy and The Army is not a system, but it is all military. It needs to graduate from the military academy. Like the generals of the older generation, they graduated from the Imperial Royal Military Academy. The school is divided into the Army Department and the Admiralty Department. It is strictly calculated that everyone is a classmate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are just ordinary soldiers, this relationship will become worthless and meaningful, but when they succeed in the peak of life, any Unremarkable relationships will be run by them into a huge network of relationships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is very satisfied with Thomas’s reply. Of course, he also knows that Thomas’s cooperation is not because of the relationship between the two, but in Du Lin. It seems that this seemingly iron relationship is the need to transport a large amount of materials to the Navy every month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone intends to riot in my city, I think about it, in the face of these evil mobs, what I should do is not to condone their arrogance, should not let them I hurt the empire but didn't pay anything...", this topic is a bit heavy, and Du Lin's tone is very low. "I hope to be able to contact the army of the warning zone and use the force to suppress these mobs when necessary." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas did not feel anything wrong after listening to it. The Imperial Army’s suppression of riots was not once or twice, but he was a bit strange. “People who use the police station will not do it. Why? Why should you involve the Army? You know, sometimes speaking is not very useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the number of people involved in the riots may be tens of thousands or even more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas originally intended to tell Du Lin that this is not a good errand, by the way A few small money, but when he said tens of thousands of rioters, Thomas knew that he could not intervene. This kind of thing will inevitably attract the attention of the top of the empire. Anyone who has a relationship with this matter will be stared. If he takes the money... no matter whether it succeeds or not, he may face the military. Court charges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way, Major General has not slept, I will talk to him about this and see how he responds to you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I will return to Irian when the election is over. When we meet, we will talk again." Du Lin hung up and the whole person was slack. Come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only noticed a faint fragrance in his nose at this time. He looked back at Natalie and noticed that she actually regained her Makeup. Although the makeup is very light, you can still see it. She also wore a short skirt and wore a white shirt, which was very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a woman gets makeup and dresses up before seeing you, this woman is interesting to you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin looked at her, she quickly avoided Doolin’s gaze. According to the normal script, she should now say some scenes, such as things. I should have gone after I finished it. But in another world, a woman who defeated six-eye flying fish gave her courage, she did not leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin realized that Natalie wanted to do something. He had learned about the woman’s past and naturally did not have any psychological burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and closed the office door and asked, "Have a shower?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;When I woke up the next morning, Du Lin felt that she was in the house, and sometimes the necessary venting was necessary. Natalie had gotten up and bought breakfast for Doolin, still a specialty of Otis - Ground beef with steamed wheat kernels and a fresh goose egg yolk. The beef is a little more than normal, and the soup is more. Each of the kernels is tightly locked by the thick broth, and the aroma of the nose makes the appetite wide open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just ate a little, and Dove took the breakfast. She looked at Natalie, who was packing up the scattered documents, and the breakfast Dulin was eating. She smelled the hormonal explosion in the air. The smell, suddenly know what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need me to clean up the inside?", Dove put down the breakfast brought to Doolin, isn't that the life of the rich? In her view, Du Lin is the normal Du Lin. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Natalie suddenly a little panic, "No, no, I like to clean up." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp Natalie, who had been in the body for a long time, was not crazy enough to be outside, and she quickly got into the rest room of Doolin. She packed all the sheets and put them in her hands. It seems to be ready to take home to clean one. After the Fan came back. If she didn't think she couldn't move the heavy mattress, she didn't mind bringing the mattress back together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin only thought it was fun. "Give Dove, she is my life steward, don't need to avoid her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natalie put the sheets on the table and turned and left. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Dove glanced at the sheets on the table, smiled and asked: "? Do you like older women" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and shook his head. In fact, he knew that Dove sometimes showed a special kind of information, but every time he pretended to be invisible, it was just a little embarrassing thing today. Du Lin felt it necessary to make it clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not that I like older women, but I am not a suitable marriage partner. I can’t even talk about feelings." He leaned back on the chair. I sighed. "If one day I can be the only voice of this empire, then I will get married, but before that, the idea of ​​getting married is not only funny, but also dangerous. You will not forget that Alisa happened. "What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dove smiled and calmed down in the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is a jerk, but he is also a bastard with his own code of conduct. He doesn't mind having a super friendship with others, but he really doesn't fit. Married, even love is not suitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a selfish standpoint, his marriage is worth a lot of money, and maybe it will become a bargaining chip to change his fate in the future. Marriage is not a rare thing. In many "worlds" that ordinary people don't know, marriage is strictly controlled. For example, those industry trusts, in order to avoid the loss of equity and power, before the owner does not agree, the people in the family choose the object of marriage, only to make people within the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cousin, cousin, cousin, cousin, it seems very confusing, but this stupid way makes the family's industry not go out. For example, Nasha, her future husband will definitely not be Doolin, unless Du Lin is willing to merge his industry with the George family's industry, otherwise Nasha's future husband can only be Arthur's child. Unless she gives up all her powers, she can go out and pursue her own love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Dooling doesn’t care for her. She doesn’t necessarily do it, and her father won’t allow her to do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing does not happen only in this world. In the world in Doolin’s dream, that is the most free transition, some big families are completely The paradise of close relatives, some insiders are even shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin intends to sell himself a good price, he will consider selling himself when he needs the most help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking about reasons that are not selfish, marrying him or falling in love with him is actually a very dangerous thing. Alisa's business is definitely not an isolated incident. People want to force him to do what he does not want by controlling Dulin's most important person. But Du Lin will not compromise, and this is destined to be hurt, or even death. Therefore, he tries to avoid such a situation, to make himself suffer, and to make people suffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he does not object to this demand, the body is honest after all, there is always a need for this, and this is what he now understands. Suppressing one's own desires only produces the urge to destroy, and only the release can receive the blessings of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one day someone uses Natalie to threaten him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can try it out boldly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dov can't fully understand Dulin's meaning, but she also has her own ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
