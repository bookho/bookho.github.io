			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff is a very ordinary imperial citizen, he has a natural curly hair, a large piece of hustle and bustle, and his big-eyed look makes him look at least Not like a bad guy, this is what most people know about him. In fact, Jeff is the most famous director and photographer in the private world and the owner of the tape company. Thanks to the booming tape industry, some people with dreams have the power to chase their dreams. Jeff It is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of tape, when it comes to TV or player, the first thing that comes to mind is that the family is happy to sit in the living room and watch various movies. Need to go to the crowded and smelly cinema to watch a movie with a group of strangers, not to endure the rude fart and lack of education in the film screening process. In addition, you can watch things that you can't see in the movie theater, such as the tape of the Empire Star and the Star Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, tape and player have become an important part of the middle class life, but this does not include the low class and the proletariat. The cost of expensive TV players and tapes constrained the access of the lower class and the proletariat to entertainment, so Jeff thought of a good idea to make money, and he opened a small-scale auditorium. He mortgaged his grandfather's small house to the bank and purchased five players and some tape to play in his own house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone only needs to pay 30% to watch the content for two hours. If you pay 50% for one time, it is six hours. Of course, if anyone is willing to pay It’s enough to spend just one dollar a day. When Jeff came up with this business, he didn't count on how much wealth this business could bring him. He only wanted to redeem his grandfather's house, and he could make a little money every month without him to continue working. Let him Have more time to think at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, his business is surprisingly good! Almost from morning till night, people watched those shows, so that he had to rent a larger warehouse nearby to expand his business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff earned money, and many people began to try to buy players and tape to make money, after all, the income of tens of dollars a day is really eye-catching, and The cost of investment is not large, and the rate of return is very high. More and more places have such a broadcast hall, and Jeff's business has also begun to decline. The gradual equality of supply and demand is the law of the free market. As the amount of money earned is less and less, Jeff is becoming more and more reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he still earns a lot for ordinary office workers, he is more eager to go back to the time when he earned dozens of pieces every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, he bought a tape of film, which is said to be quite large, to the extent that the heroine actually went out of underwear. The social atmosphere is actually very open, but this kind of opening has not been open to the extent that it exposes its privacy to everyone, so large-scale movies only reveal underwear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be a very ordinary day, but a complaint from an audience inspired Jeff - why didn't she take off her clothes, I spent money Is it to see her walking around in front of me in her pajamas? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flash of light flashes, tearing the dark clouds, bringing light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Jeff invited a few friends who also opened the playroom to their homes. They were all good friends, and although they robbed each other of their business, But still a good friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have an idea that will allow our playroom to continue to burst, guys, this is a genius idea!", except for the black frame on the entire face The glasses are the ones that slap the palms of the slaps. "We shoot some tapes to play, so the cost will be lower, and others don't have these things, and we can continue to make countless money!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Jeff, let's talk out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff looks at all People, with a smile of excitement, "We filmed the men who forgot to wear clothes and the women who forgot to wear clothes to fight for victory in order to fight for victory...", looking at the little friends who watched the dog stay in Jeff’s mind. The idea became more and more perfect, just like having a hand manipulating him and giving him a terrible complete idea. He walked around, waving his arms and saying, "We don't need any plots, or just a short story, so we don't need a screenwriter."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no fantasy or sci-fi content in the content, the framing is simpler, our bedroom, or garage, horse shed and the like can be used, which saves us money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actors... I believe that women who are skilled are willing to cooperate with our performances, because they can also drive their own attendance, only a small amount of money can be Let them work hard for us to perform at least forty minutes of the story."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to the above, we also need a camera, some video equipment, no more than a thousand! Guys, who wants to work with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, everyone had a little interest before Jeff said the last sentence, but when he said the words "to do with him," they all closed their mouths. A thousand is not a small sum of money, and they are not sure if this can make the business get better again. With the current profit, each person must invest at least 200 yuan. They will be white in the past two months, and the business is getting worse and worse. Maybe it is possible to go bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditorium also needs funds to maintain, especially if you buy or rent some tape, you need a lot of money. If you are a partner in business, maybe they can think about spelling their teeth, but with Jeff, it feels like they are paying Jeff to start a business and not to be his employee. Maybe Jeff himself is not aware. At this point, but how disgusting it is to say how disgusting. I don't know if I have a business to start a business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last meeting was a disappointment, and Jeff calmed down from the excitement. He realized that some things have been after they have a little economic foundation. I started to change my taste and I couldn’t find the feeling of the past. The next day he went to the bank, made a mortgage on his house, took 2,200 blocks and returned to the house belonging to the bank. Looking at the house that might not belong to him soon, Jeff forced I have enough courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day he entrusted the auditorium to Grandpa, and then ran out to purchase all the necessary products for all the video recordings, and spent One thousand seven hundred. This is much more than spending as he imagined. What is more troublesome is that women who are skilled have no interest in putting themselves in the tape to let others see. So, after Jeff said, Jeff hired one for fifty dollars. The widow who is doing this is willing to show her face on the tape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this widow has a requirement that Jeff’s content is only allowed to be used by Jeff himself and not allowed to be played. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everything was ready, there was still a problem - no male lead, so Jeff could only play on his own, starring in a big beast and beauty There have also been many accidents. For example, the little widow's fighting power and desire to win is too strong. For example, after half of the two people took the soldiers, they remembered that it was shooting, or that Jeff could not find a better shooting angle. In short, it took more than ten days to finish the film with a total length of forty minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
