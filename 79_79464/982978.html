			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald once imagined that one day he might become the master of the city of Otis, but he also knew that it was always just a fantasy, Doolin’s existence for him In fact, it is not just an object that needs him to learn, but also a mountain that can never be crossed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked himself if he was in another ruined city, how should he grow the city as fast as possible and let this The city is dazzling? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is no, he has no way to do this. The political experience of more than ten years has taught him that a city can start from the foundation As a city, the effort required can never be completed overnight. Many cities have been built for more than a decade and have had some success. It takes a year to build a city from scratch. It is simply impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this thing that seems impossible to him has become possible in the hands of Doolin. It took only a year for Doolin to make this deadly and ruined city a star of the middle of the empire, attracting people from all over the world to travel and staying here. People have always used miracles to describe the city of Otis, and also used the founder of miracles to describe Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this period of time, in fact, Donald has not played a role in the development of the city, not as the official propaganda, in the construction of the city It has played a positive role. He has been analyzing why Dulin and Otis can be a miracle. He summed up the points, the most important of which is to mobilize the enthusiasm of all people, to let them see the future at their fingertips, in order to seize the future, These people are concentrating on the development of the city. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Donald also believes that since Du Lin left the Otis City package listing plan, then the merchants who exclude non-Otis business groups are not Reasonable things. It is not because these businessmen are unwilling to withdraw from the Chamber of Commerce, they will not give them the opportunity to go public with the city. They also contributed a lot of power here, both in construction and in business, and they all have the shadow of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately caused a huge response after he spoke it out at the conference inside the city. The response mainly came from two aspects, the business group and Chamber of Commerce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the city business group thought that Donald was trampling on the "heritage" left by Doolin. He did not position himself well as a qualified heir. He thought It is inconsistent with everyone's interests to take the initiative to destroy something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chamber of Commerce expressed gratitude and expectations for the development of the city of Otis after the new mayor took office. The impact of an enlightened mayor on a city is absolutely huge. They are willing to cooperate with Donald's work during Donald's administration and maintain the current booming situation in Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May Donald, your mind and vision far exceed Mr. Doolin, I believe that only by all of us can we consolidate our cause And put this career to a new height!", Psyche stood at Donald's side holding a glass of wine, doing everything he could to praise Donald's contribution to the merchants' "lifting the ban." Heidele stood on one side with a wine glass, and said this with the governor of the commemoration from the Imperial Chamber of Commerce, and his eyes looked at Puxi from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Dooling left Otis, Puxi is the most active person. It can be said that Donald’s decision to let the members of the Chamber of Commerce join the listing plan is the credit of Puxi. Under his constant lobbying, Donald finally nodded in agreement with his vision and personally announced the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Chamber of Commerce members are surrounded by Puxi, who feel that Puxi is more reliable than Heidler. At least when they are in trouble, Puxi has been running for their interests. They have decided to vote for Puxi at the next election, so that he can be a member of the council, so active and enthusiastic about the interests. The people who are in the top will also have great benefits for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that your status can't be saved." The speaker and Heidele touched the glass, and the two took a sip of the wine in the cup. He continued. Said: "Some people have some opinions about your inaction recently. I feel that you have not fulfilled your duties. If there is no accident, you may be embarrassed when you choose next time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The election is an important activity for the Chamber of Commerce to elect Members. It will be held every six years, regardless of the number of re-elections. In most cases, the results of the election and the previous results will not be much. deviation. This group of merchants is very realistic. Who can bring business opportunities, profits and policies to everyone, and who they will vote for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Header has done a good job in this regard. The state of Cannes is remote, and the forces of the old and new parties are comparable. So he is the general meeting of the Chamber of Commerce. The staff is very important to both people. He represented the interests of Chamber of Commerce members in the state of Cannes and won the help and support of Heidler. At least in economic construction, it will not lose points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after arriving in Cosnas, the situation turned sharply. Everyone’s eyes were concentrated in the city of Otis. However, he did not get a little bit of benefit for everyone in the huge gold cave of Otis. Let the capitalists who are not accustomed to the "minority" find the gap of the firepower, and accuse Heidler of occupying a position of a member of the parliament but do nothing at all. He should be taken away and replaced with a capable one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler didn’t care about this. A few days ago, he was still considering whether to stand up and try to get some benefits for everyone, but he soon Changed my mind. His supportive attitude allowed Psyche to find an opportunity to represent everyone and to make him successful. Heidler didn't care about it because he thought that Du Lin could not have left so simply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has known him for several years. It can be said that the person who knows the most about Du Lin in the entire Chamber of Commerce is Heidler. Du Lin used it in the city of Otis. So much energy and effort to run here, it is impossible to leave nothing because of a recall order, and leave nothing. He must have left his back hand here. Whoever dares to reach out first will definitely cut the hand. If someone stretches his head, he will let the person lose his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heyle’s big capitalist who has experienced too many youngsters, such as Heidler, has long lived a stubborn stage, since Psyche wants to make a head bird, why After waiting for Puxi to be solved by Doolin, he has reservations and talked about these problems with Du Lin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speaker has been paying attention to Heidler’s expression. He is keenly aware that this old fox seems to be really slack, and the indifferent expression and the contempt in his eyes make him realize the possibility. There are other things in it. "It looks like you are not worried!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Worried?" Heidler laughed and asked, "Why? Worried?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I lose the position of a member of parliament, I will not feel terrible or sad. I have reached the age of retirement and should not be much. Enjoy the happiness that I have not enjoyed on the road of life. If I have not lost the position, I will not take the initiative to do anything, I will still fight for the benefits that can be won for everyone. So you say me Don't worry? Right, I don't worry at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very good, I am very envious, but you have to be careful, someone intends to get funding I am in trouble with the pool."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
