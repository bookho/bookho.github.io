			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fall of Colliers has made many people realize that the legacy of the railway tycoon will be divided in the war between his children and relatives. "The railway empire" will no longer be a piece of iron, and many capital forces are already ready to move. When Colliers decides to wake up, they sit on the table and tie the napkins, pick up the knife and fork, elegant and civilized. The moment to divide the Colliers heritage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, some smaller railway contractors have also found Du Lin, who hope to win the construction rights of these two railways. Millions or more of the project can bring them too much profit and influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the builders on the federal side have appeared in the city of Otis, intending to build the railway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of these intended contractors, Doolin gathered them together to discuss who would leave and who would leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the city hall of Otis can not take out all the costs of building this railway at once. Du Lin asked some professionals who gave Du Lin’s estimate of the cost of the two railways is about 25 to 30 million. If there are other requirements for the railway, such as being able to carry a heavier steam locomotive or wanting the steam locomotive to run faster, then the cost It will also rise sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building a railroad that is relatively high in the Western world, at least about 40 million, so the original quote of Colliers is not accurate, or There are actually other tricks inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is 30 million, it will take at least one year of revenue from the city of Otis to support the construction costs of the two railways, so Du Linyi At the beginning, I told all the contractors who planned to take over the project. They need to fund the funds. In the initial stage, they may need to pay about 10 to 15 million funds. This part of the capital city hall will be in the next 18 months. Returned monthly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is such a condition, some representatives of the contractor’s face are not so good, more than 10 million padding is enough to make many big capitalists feel hurt Bone, not to mention the vulnerable people they have been stepping on at the foot of Colliers? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representative of the contractor from the western part of the empire sighed and asked: "Mr. Mayor, have you considered lending to the bank or the Chamber of Commerce? I believe Both the central bank and the general meeting will be very happy to give you financial support. This is something that makes sense to everyone." He said that nothing is too much financial pressure, workers’ wages, Material settlement and various other expenses, if the City of Otis City can not return the cost of the funds on time, the company may collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These capitalists never pin their hopes on how trustworthy their partners are, especially for official partners, who are even more distrustful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unlikely event that the city of Otis really has no money, can you sue the city hall of Otis? Even if the prosecution is useful? The mayor patted his ass and the successor did not recognize the money. In the end, it is very likely that he will be able to climb in and out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the representative, most people have expressed understanding and approval, this is not a one or two million, but more than 10 million, risk too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have any suggestions?", Doolin nodded undecidedly, then looked at the contractor who was sitting in the last federal, only he has been Smiling. The guy named Klin stood up and expressed his respect to Du Lin. His voice was very loud and thorough. A very uplifting feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Mr. Otis, and representatives of the Yaoxing Empire, everyone. As you know, I am from the Federation, jointly built It is a large federal engineering company, we have the most professional designers, the most outstanding engineers and the most dedicated employees. We have completed many projects that are known as impossible, and this is why I am here today." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klin left the seat and distributed the brochure in his hand to each business representative. "We not only provide the best design, but also provide a certain degree. Financial plan, Mr. Mayor, please forgive me for the next arrogance. What you worry about is not a problem in my opinion. We can provide financial support of no less than 30 million yuan, of course, the interest rate will be slightly higher. The annual profit is 11%. Before you pay the entire construction payment, the railway operation right is temporarily owned by our company!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will be the last one Propaganda brochure issued to After Turin, he smiled and stood aside and did not care that business representatives Empire angry eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Colliers who suddenly lost consciousness, they wouldn’t dare to hang in the railroad of the Yaoxing Empire. Colliers holds the operating rights of more than 60% of the empire's railways, and can also intervene in the operation of the remaining railways. As long as he is there, there is no “third party” in the field of railway transportation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he fell, which also made the federal capitalists realize that this is the best opportunity to enter the imperial railway transportation industry in the past three decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rail transport itself has huge profit margins, but also has enough political influence, these are always capital chasing things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past year, under the influence of the Federal Business Coalition, federal capital forces have begun to rapidly invade the economic realm of the Empire, and the emergence of large-scale duty-free goods The local market of the empire, now they are no longer satisfied with the small fights, began to embark on the political arena of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin agrees to the request of the federal businessman, it means that the federal has broken the "zero" situation and successfully broke the ice. This is definitely not a piece. Good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Mayor, I think we should expel this federal man with evil intentions!", a representative stood up and made a loud request. "This is the territory of the empire. It should also be an imperial person to build a railway on the territory of the empire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klin did not look at the guy, has been watching Du Lin, he laughed and said: "Mr. Mayor, no matter what time you have enough funds, you can get back to the railway operation righttime and anywhere. This is just business, and has nothing to do with the great patriotic sentiments of the country and your gentlemen. The business should be pure, without any position, and we can indeed come up with a construction plan that meets your needs, what do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin slightly walked back and forth a few steps. He shook his head and said, "Ten percent is too much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinton’s surprise His excited lips began to pick up, it seems that Doolin is accusing him of providing Financial schemes unacceptable conditions, but it is in fact telling everyone that he would choose to do this federal businessman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of local representatives have expressed disappointment, and several people have left the meeting with anger, they know that they lost in this competition. At the same time, they also realized that in the near future, more federal businessmen will appear in the Empire and compete with the Empire Capital for market share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic recovery of the empire is like a honeycomb with honey dripping, which has already attracted many people's voyeurism, and this day will never be too far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Du Lin, this is no way. He is short of money. He can even say that he will always be short of money in the future. Those representatives of the Imperial position cannot give a better plan. He cannot be because of his hand. If the money is not enough, the railway plan will be dragged down. The city of Otis needs these two railways. It can be said that as long as these two railways are available, it is only a matter of time before the nano Lindes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't wait too long, and those investors can't wait too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe like the advice of those people, it is a good idea to borrow from a bank or a chamber of commerce. The problem is that the bank needs the city hall to pledge at least 18 months of tax revenue, which means that after the loan to the bank, every penny collected in the city in the next 18 months will be with Du Lin. It doesn't matter to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Chamber of Commerce, he just overwhelmed the workers’ union and turned to the Chamber of Commerce for loans. The Chamber of Commerce will definitely open an unbearable condition for the Chamber of Commerce. The influence expands into every corner of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are taken away by these people, the future of the city is not as good as the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things seem to be a foregone conclusion, Doolin let Natalie send away other people, sit down with Klein and talk about building the railway. In the next few days, more and more federal people have arrived in the city of Otis, forming a negotiating team and the City Hall of Otis to discuss the details of the construction of the railway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, Doolin puts forward a request and a requirement that must be met, that is, all workers must be imperial, and management must have at least three empire people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business negotiations involving tens of millions of funds like this can never be decided by a meal time. After 12 days, the two parties signed The final agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This construction company called "Joint Construction" took over the project of Doolin, and the initial investment of not less than 20 million, Otis City The City Hall needs to pay no less than 10 million funds, and all funds are subject to both supervision and supervision. After one-third of the project period is reached, the total construction cost is calculated, and then the City of Otis City will start paying interest and repaying the principal according to the fee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
