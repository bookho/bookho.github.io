			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darcy did not believe in leaving the training ship with his family and his family. He thought that even if he said it, he would be killed by Du Lin. After all, he The identity of this big man who knows is very special. It is very likely that Du Lin needs to destroy. But he never thought that Du Lin actually realized his promise and let them safely return to the land, it is like dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been swallowed by the dragon and waiting to die. I didn’t expect the dragon to get cold, so he licked a thin one—that is, diarrhea. Pull them out completely, should you thank him for this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the training ship that far away, what Darcy just wanted to say, his subordinates left in twos and threes, and this matter has nothing to do with them. They are also tired of Darcy's stupidity on the deck. Did he actually abandon the love between his brothers for his family? I want to know that when everyone formed a gang, they said that they are family members and they are more important than their families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darcy opened his mouth and finally said nothing. In the face of four women and three children, he could only sigh deeply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just... he mistakenly overestimated Doolin’s “goodwill” and underestimated Doolin’s “maliciousness”! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one minute after Doolin let them go, Colonel Thomas contacted the Irian Telegraph Bureau with a telegraph machine on the fleet and called the police through the telegraph office. The phone said that the gang members of the free front line escaped in the middle of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this alarm phone sounds more funny and funny, the police station accepted the alarm after Colonel Thomas confirmed his identity as a military officer and personality. Telephone, and applied for a wanted order to the State Police Investigation Bureau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone in the face of death will have an unparalleled desire to survive, so I can't judge whether Darcy is true or false. At the same time, I need to guess the person and the whole thing with the most malicious thoughts. Will someone give me a set and lead me in the wrong direction." Du Lin smiled and shrugged. "So we Need to verify whether the content of Mr. Darcy’s confession is true, or is he cheating on me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas’s stunned look is like listening to death The origin of the verses found in the crater, in such an instant, he had a slight doubt about himself and the world. Du Lin is too clever, or is he too stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Dudu has long been accustomed to it. In the understanding of the Buddha, Du Lin is almost omnipotent. He always finds the best solution at the most suitable time to find the best answer. Never worry about it and don't want to think about it. It's Du Lin's life. He just needs to be responsible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the person who kills Darcy is the same person as the person he confessed, or belongs to a same force, then what he said is true. If no one is chasing Killing him, or killing him is not the person he confessed, then it is very likely that what he said is fake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I gave him a fill in the blank Question, how much is equal to two, then let the 'examiner' tell us that he has filled in the right.", Du Lin looked at the Buddha, "Let our people pay attention to him, then inform Mr. Jack, We need some help from him." If Darcy does not lie, then he should be busy now. Du Lin's current intelligence network is in some first-tier cities and developed cities, and does not cover some remote cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this requires Mr. Jack to provide some help. Their network covers almost all the shady places. As long as someone washes money, they must have their tentacles. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throws suddenly tickles on the top of his head. He scratched and asked: "To tell the truth, have you given me a question?", Du Lin explained Underneath Thomas finally realized that he couldn't help but feel a cold sweat. Du Lin's mind was terrible. At the same time, he also raised a question, that is, whether Du Lin had given himself a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Thomas’s question, Doolin laughed. “Colonel Thomas, do you have a lot of money?” Thomas thought about it and shook his head, compared to The money in Doolin’s pocket, his money is not even money. Dooling asked again, "So you have a lot of power?" Thomas shook his head again. He knew that his colonel was fake, so he continued to shake his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Still say...", Du Lin smiled, and Thomas smiled a little creepy. "Or do you want to harm me?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible, why do I still harm you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's right!", Du Lin picked up the juice cup Taking a breath, "Since you don't have what I need, and don't want to harm me, we are still the best friends, then what do I have to give you a question? Mr. Thomas?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After landing, Du Lin sat on the steam locomotive that returned to Nano Lindes. After all, he is still a "wounded person" and he needs to be rested. However, his follow-up method did not stop at all. On the steam locomotive, the conductor sent him seven newspapers. The first three boards of each newspaper have an article with a very good content, and the content is even more shocking. In these articles, Du Lin was described as a very good business genius and a qualified mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a list of the industries and scales he can say, and the four-month changes in the city of Otis are described in detail. If you only read the first half of the newspaper, many people think that this is likely to be the foundation of the New Party in order to launch Du Lin. Maybe Du Lin will soon face a good job of promotion. All this is to make his appreciation of the value more reasonable, at least not to make people think that he is an incompetent person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the second half of these articles, Wen Feng suddenly turned around and began to describe the assassination of Du Lin. If the journalists of these press releases have this Assassination time to racial discrimination, the analysis is very different, even Du Lin looked at it and it seems that this is indeed the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the current Guardian who holds the highest position in the ruling party, it is both typical and wave. Some people like him, then there will be some extreme racists who dislike him. Under the influence and stimulation of certain emotions, under the sensational promotion and incitement of some people, there has been such a horrific assassination case, shaking The entire empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a very smart young man." John was lying on the bed, he put down the newspaper in his hand, and Mark sat at his bed. He raised his hand and there was a needle on the back of his hand connected to the infusion bottle. His recent physical condition has gone from bad to worse, and he has reached the point of needing treatment. Perhaps this is related to his concerns. The only reliable son has only one daughter. It seems that he does not intend to regenerate a few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other son is a bastard who is actually tied to his "outsiders" such as his brothers and sisters to seek his estate. He is worried about George after decades. The family will become a past tense, and all the glory will only stay in the historical literature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he is ill and needs treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John’s finger fell twice in the newspaper, and the newspaper made a crisp voice. “This is a very interesting young man. He is very smart and knows how to Use yourself as the victim's identity to get the most out of yourself. We all know that this is a political event, but ordinary people don't know, he keeps covering the lid while continuing to tout his gult being discriminated against. The theory of unfair treatment, which is very useful, shifts the people’s attention and makes them look even poorer, at least the public is willing to accept such news.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compared to the political scandal, they are more willing to believe that the political history is pure, look at it, and soon he will launch a new round of topics to manipulate public opinion and public opinion. The only uncertainty is how much his appetite is." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John has been in the news industry for a lifetime, and his political literacy is high. He may not know the details and the story behind the assassination, but he is keenly aware that Du Lin is using his sensational effects of assassination to seek greater benefits for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you put it in peacetime, he will not be interested. But now he said so, people will be interested, and will sympathize with him, after all, he is a victim, is a "weak." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark did not speak on one side, and his experience also did not understand Du Lin’s intentions, so he was very open-minded to accept the experience taught by Mr. John. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These articles are passed by Nasha?" John asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark immediately nodded, "Nasha just told me about it and asked for my opinion. We and Doolin are in the honeymoon period, so I don’t think it’s a good idea to help him. Secondly, the news itself has great news value and social influence, which is very helpful for expanding the authority and popularity of the George family in the newspaper industry and the public. I agreed with Nasha's thoughts and asked some articles below."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John shook his head after listening to laughter, "Mark, my son. In me When I first entered this line, I will use some news and clear positions that can scare people to grasp the audience. But we have already passed that stage, now we need a neutral position, not biased towards any party. , a politician. Only then can we continue to survive and there will be no deadly challenges."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This newspaper...", he I laughed, "You need to learn." There are still many places, and future reports should try to guarantee our position, unless..." His expression changed and he smiled at Mark. Mark lowered his head and prepared to listen to Mr. John’s suggestion, "unless he can accept Cannes." Sha, otherwise there will be news that deviates from this position, so don't send it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark suddenly raised his face and looked awkward, with some doubts in his eyes," Are you saying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
