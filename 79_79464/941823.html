			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the top floor, Vitor just wanted to say something, Ferry Jia looked at him with a cold face and saw him bow his head and go to his room. Vitor stood in the hallway and watched Felicia enter the room before returning to his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that Fei Lijia must be dissatisfied with what happened today. When he first arrived in Otis, he had a conflict with the local city hall, even at the expense of Sharpening the contradictions, as Vittor has an unshirkable responsibility. He is not a follower of Felica, nor is he a randy man. He will be Ferrari's big butler in the future. He must arrange everything properly, instead of having a planned conflict like today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his job, he is not doing well, that is his responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the room, Fei Lijia sighed and sighed. She actually didn’t want to have such a conflict with Doolin, and she was even more reluctant to intensify each other. The contradiction between. But from the family's standpoint, she must do this. Many times, some ordinary people always think that the rules of the big family are too much, too strict, too arrogant, and there is no way to do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any forgiveness and compassion are very good virtues for ordinary people, but for this big family, that is a principled mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don’t show your own thorns and a sharp fangs, others will treat your pity forgiveness as a low-cost warning, then they will Continue to deepen your mistakes until you are unable to be forgiven. When it comes to that step, people will only say poor ordinary people, despicable big families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since at the end of the day, you can’t please the people at the bottom of the society, why should you forgive them at the beginning? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it’s stupid? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened today is actually a little different. Du Lin is not an ordinary person. He is the authority of the City Hall of Otis. He manages the city. And have a certain position within the New Party. This conflict can make the new politicians who do not like the northern aristocracy even hate the northern aristocrats. There may not be any targeted political events in a short time, but after a long time, it will always be because of this. Ordinary things become less common. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next three days, I hope that the young Mayor of Doolin will be able to put his eyes brighter and let the conflicts between them end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferica, who had been entertained for one night, was already exhausted, and she took a break after she had a simple scrub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the maid rang the door and sent her breakfast. There are twelve dishes in the two dining cars, and almost all the dishes will be dumped only after a taste. Fei Lijia simply packed herself in her pajamas, sitting on the window and basking in the sun to eat breakfast, holding a local newspaper in Otis, Otis Daily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no too much political news in the newspapers. On the contrary, entertaining news not only occupies the headlines, but also almost fills the entire newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headline of the front page this morning is titled "The Seventh Lucky", with a photo of an ecstatic man below, Felicia carefully After reading it again, I realized that this man had successfully replaced one hundred and fifty pieces with the three figures of the highest rate Otis roulette in the casino with 150 pieces in the Golden Branch Casino last night. Five hundred and forty thousand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Otis Roulette is said to be a kind of gambling game developed by Du Lin that has never appeared before, which is particularly exciting. The game only needs a table for betting and a table with three roulette sets. The three outer wheels have thirty-six squares on the outermost side, from one to thirty-six, red and black. At the beginning of the game, the dealer will turn the wheel clockwise and throw a steel ball into the wheel in a counterclockwise manner. When the wheel stops, the grid where the ball is located is the final result. Second, the third wheel is similar, but the grid will be reduced. There are eighteen grids on the second floor and only nine on the innermost layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you press a number in the outermost wheel, you will have 36 times the reward, the second layer is 18 times, the most It is nine times inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, there are guesses and doubles, guessing red and black and guessing and the like, the odds are between two and one hundred and eighty times. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest odds for this game is 3,600 times. You need to bet on the final result of the three rounds before the game starts, guess one or The two double at a separate odds, but if all three numbers are pressed, it is three thousand six hundred times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lucky guy of this good fortune was so lucky that he pressed all the numbers, and he was mad at the odds of 50,000 yuan. The excitement was almost sent to the hospital by an ambulance. According to the reporter's interview, this guy runs a fairly good restaurant. It has been four days since I took my family to Otis, and I plan to leave the next day. Before leaving the casino, he put the last 150 chips in his hand on the last date of a family birthday, and actually made him bet.... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felika opened the second page, and she was very clear in her heart. If this person is not the person who Du Lin invited to play in this scene, then Du Lin’s people moved his hands and feet and made him a lucky one. Judging from the title, there are still six lucky winners before him. There is no doubt that these people may have won the maximum reward with very small bets. It is precisely because of the constant appearance of these lucky people that many people who think they are lucky have come to the city of Otis, and then leave all their wealth and leave with an empty wallet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very powerful marketing method, Fei Lijia’s face is quiet, and the heart has already recorded this matter. This is the biggest difference between the South and the North. It is not very good to do business in the north. Everyone has a very clear understanding of what to buy and what to sell. The traders are also more honest in the "territory" of the nobility and will not come up with such a gimmick. Compared to the lively business atmosphere of the South, the commercial atmosphere in the North is somewhat dead and needs to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second page, the third page until the last page is almost all attractive content, people can't help but need to gamble, Or go play some entertainment facilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put down the newspaper, picked up the napkin and dipped her lips, and let the maid put on her a very good set of clothes, she called and let Vitor came to her room to discuss the three-day trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Du Lin’s troubles are so unpleasant, and it’s impossible for him to take them with them, and they can only arrange them by themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Fei Lijia and his group went downstairs, someone immediately called Du Lin and they went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was slapped by them so painful, how could his character be more comfortable? Even the hymn consortium can't oppress him, can you change it even more? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also did not intend to use the violent way to retaliate back. Felicia could drop his face in a quiet manner, and he could return in the same way, and let them have nothing to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he stared at them, the yellow light on the desk lit up, which meant someone was waiting for him to answer the call. This small device was made by the Imperial Academy. It was mainly to solve the problem that some big people had unnecessary troubles due to busy business missed calls. In fact, there is nothing remarkable about wearing it. It is on the telegraph office. It is as simple as adding a few lines to queue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said a few words after hanging up the phone, pressed the yellow button, the phone line immediately connected to another line, "I am Doolin ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mayor of Doolin, I am Bren, I don't know if I should tell you...", Blaine's tone He showed a little hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are not sure what to say, then you must tell me, my brother!", if one can accurately distinguish A thing that has something to do with others does not need to notify the person, so his judgment is at least based on certainty. On the contrary, if you are not sure and can't find the basis for the judgment, this hesitation will arise, and this must be told to the parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brianon breathed a sigh of relief and told Doolin about what he found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two days, he suddenly found a lot of reporters in the city of Nano Lindes. If it was not a big news six months ago, it was the pearl of the empire's hinterland. It is normal for a reporter to come to the city for an interview. Without these reporters, it is not normal. But now is not the past, the decline of Nano Lindes is no longer news, people are not concerned about these things, and Brenen made people inquire about it, only to find that these people seem to be "investigating the case." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are looking for clues about the attacks that occurred some time ago. Blair knows some truth, he is not sure what the purpose of these people is, so Only have such a phone call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thanked a Brighton for his kind reminder. After talking a few words, he hung up the phone. He called the security company and let the Kina. Several people went to Nano Lindes, grabbed a reporter back, and he needed to figure out what was going on, so that things that had already subsided could be renewed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
