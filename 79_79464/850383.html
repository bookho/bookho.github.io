			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Peter’s egg has been hurt, and it’s a bit ugly, which makes him unable to have offspring like a normal man, but that doesn’t mean he can’t do some adulthood. What men can do. In addition to the terminal illness of infertility, he does not have any other functional problems, so he does not mind a little more other projects at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been said that he has several mistresses outside. In fact, these are people’s misunderstandings about him. He put all his energy and mind and body into politics. How can I have time to do something meaningless? The source of this rumor is actually from himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that if a mayor is too "far" away from the ordinary people, it will create an illusion that it is difficult to accept. He also needs the votes of these people, so he Must stand with everyone. Create some negative and negative lace news to entertain the public. This will not only affect the positive image of the damage, but also make everyone feel like a living person, but they don’t know each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will make mistakes, have a mistress, and occasionally say a few foul language, he maintains his image very well, if not Vivienne insists on divorce He will not do such extreme things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked the girl this question and the girl apparently stunned before answering him, "Sir, I am already an adult, you don't have to worry." I licked my lips and used my upper teeth to bite my lower lip. If it weren't for the exposed teeth, it was a bit yellowish. It was a bit fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter looked at her up and down, and finally focused on the girl's hand. Men look at their feet, women look at their hands, and even if they do some cover up, it is difficult to cover them all. I can see that this girl is also a teenager, Mr. Peter smiled, he likes young girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are with a young girl, you will feel that you are just as young. Young is a good thing, because young means you can make mistakes, meaning you have more More time and energy, he likes youth and doesn't like his age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his arms and shoved the girl into his arms in the girl’s low voice, and asked the bartender to have a glass of the same wine and hand it to the girl. Just as the girl was about to catch the glass, his fingers were lightly on the back of the girl's hand. The girls who are mixed in this kind of occasion are very clever and spiritual, otherwise they will become women with technology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl decisively stopped her movements, and then looked at Peter. Peter took out a banknote with a denomination of ten dollars from his pocket and shook it between the two fingers. "Sip down, this is yours." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s eyes are bright. Ten dollars in Tener’s place is definitely ten dollars. Ten dollars can do a lot of things, one ordinary middle class for one month. The income is more than 30 yuan to 40 yuan. Now she only needs a drink, and she has half a month's income from her alcoholic father. She immediately took up a four-ounce glass of wine and drank the spirits in the cup, and her face turned red, and a raging heat flowed along her throat into her stomach with a burning sensation. It’s like an earthquake in the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After about a few seconds, she took a sigh of relief, all of which was full of alcohol, and she looked at Peter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter stuffed ten dollars into the depression between the girls’ two small soil slopes and took out a ten-dollar bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the woman’s face has a touch of redness, and she smiles and picks up the glass that is full again. “You want to get drunk me? Then you have to be jealous!” After talking about drinking the wine again, Peter gave her ten dollars with great trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They only played for a little while, the girl has already shown drunkenness, and there is still a feeling of nausea. This was the case when the wine was drunk quickly. She struggled with a grin, struggled out of Peter's arms and ran to the bathroom. She needed to spit for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the girl’s wolverine Peter’s happy smile, perhaps this is the reason why those businessmen pursue wealth, but they don’t know, actually pursuing power The joy brought is far more than the countless times of using money to get happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the girl left, another girl leaned over. The girl is obviously a little higher, at least the clothes she wears are not so cheap, and there are some special temperament. She did not have the red fruit on Peter's body, but kept a certain distance, and asked with a smile, like many boys talking about girls, "One person?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peteru swears, "There is one, not vomiting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl did not speak because of Peter’s "direct" She was very interested to ask: “Do you mind three people together?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the banknotes and put them on the bar. He could feel some breathing around him suddenly becoming heavy. He liked the feeling. "Drink it, this is yours."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender pressed a glass of spirits on the banknotes. Peter gave him a tip of ten dollars. He likes smart people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl did not hesitate to put the glass up and drink it, and took the initiative to put ten dollars into his chest, making money with his skills, nothing shameful . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other girl is coming back soon, and the two are constantly fighting each other, as if their purpose here is not to want to earn anything from Peter. Not for the ten dollars in each cup, but to fight each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Played for a while, the two women were obviously drunk, and even when they had a big tongue, he reached out and slammed it on the bar and asked. One sentence, "Here... is there a room?", Peter took out another ten dollars for the bartender and the bartender nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the back door, go up the stairs and have a room, just one dollar a night.", many young men and women will have some impulse under the influence of alcohol, this Time needs to have a relatively convenient place for them to solve the physiological needs, but also to avoid these young boys and girls who do not choose the venue to indulge in youth, just find a corner to pollute the environment. After all, a bar wants to make money, especially making big money, and it is important to maintain a good atmosphere and atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only those middle-classes are willing to drink high-priced wines, and those in the bottom of the society can drink a glass of wine for one night! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter took two drunken girls out of the back door according to the directions that the bartender told him, but what he didn’t notice was the moment he left the bar. There are still a few people who have stood up and followed behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he pushed the door open into the back alley of the bar, suddenly there was a force coming behind him, pushing him forward, squatting The girl is also soft on the ground. The breeze blows, and the moment of loss of the center of gravity makes him wake up, and he stands against the wall. Three... No, four young people surrounded him, two of them holding a dagger in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colorful lights outside the alleys could not cover the cold light of the dagger. Peter raised his hands and did not panic. Instead, he smiled and asked, "What do you want? Money?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four young people look at each other, one of them nods and swears: "Yes, money, take out the money in your pocket!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter is not scared in the face of such things, not because he has had the power of man, but because he understands that everyone is doing everything in order to pursue a Specific purpose. As long as they meet these goals, they will not take the initiative to make some extraordinary things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out all the money in his pocket, probably about two hundred or so, which made the young people very excited. After they took the money, they searched Peter's pocket and found that there was really no money and threatened him. He immediately fled into the dark alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, Peter glanced at the two girls who had been intoxicated on the ground, and there was not much interest. He sorted out his clothes, turned and walked toward the alley, and while he was thinking about other things. Of course, these young people are sure to pay for their actions, but this is only a small matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was about to step out of the alley, he saw a guy who relied on a cigarette on the wall. He stood in the shadow of black and formed a strong contrast with the world of neon lights. The only one that could lightly illuminate his face was his cigarette butt. As he inhales, the fire of the cigarette butts becomes blazing and can see the vague shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter’s footsteps only pause for a few seconds, he continues to walk outside, just as he is about to pass this person, that The guy lost his cigarette butt and stepped forward toward him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only about one meter between the two. At this time, Peter has been able to see the appearance of this guy. The other person is very handsome and makes him think. I was young when I was young. The eyes of the two met in the air, no one gave up, and one thought, a quiet as a cold pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of silence only lasted for less than ten seconds. The guy laughed. There was something in Peter’s vision that moved abruptly. He looked down. The guy's arm, he saw a pistol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
