			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the four policemen who were smashed by their hands and looked up, and they all put away a smile on their faces. He slowly stopped in front of Dooling. "Would you like to hide?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood in the hands of Dudu In front of him, at this moment, in the eyes of the Buddha, Doolin's back is infinitely tall. Sometimes Buddha has a very naive imagination. He often feels ridiculous and embarrassed about this idea. He feels that if he has to have a father, then this father should be the older Du Lin. He will prepare himself for himself and his family, and will not let anyone be hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if some family members are injured, he will find a way to pay for the people who make stupid things. He is like a wise leader, a leader who never cares about the rewards and rewards of his family, standing behind them, sheltering them from the wind, or inspiring them to let them know that they are standing and walking. What is the feeling in this world. Everyone, not just the Buddha, forgot Du Lin’s age in the face of Du Lin, forgot his young appearance, and sincerely regarded him as a mentor who can lead himself to the light, and even The role of father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the hustle and bustle, Du Lin’s mouth glared with a smile, and asked with a powerful gas field that could not be said: “Hide? Why do you want to hide?”, Looking at Du Lin's indifferent expression and some... sly face, Buddha bowed his head and smiled. Even if Du Lin said that he would kill him, he would not hesitate to pull the gun... No, why is it like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, when Buddha looked up, he saw Du Lin raised his hands and walked toward the gate. The painting style became so fast that none of the Buddhas did. Keep up with his steps. The bodyguards saw Doolin choose to do this, so they naturally respected Doolin's choices and dropped the pistol, and raised his hand. The Buddha had been stunned for a while, and he couldn’t help but laugh out loud. The tears of laughter were coming out, and he raised his hands and followed Du Lin toward the light source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police outside the school finally breathed a sigh of relief. When the patrol car had no feedback for 15 minutes, the branch immediately reported the situation to the regional police station. This is also the change that Mason made after he took office. He made reference to the rules and regulations of the investigation bureau and some internal affairs departments, and formulated a set of rules and regulations different from ordinary police stations. There is such a case. In the fifteen minutes after the task is assigned and the execution begins, if the police officer performing the task does not actively contact the dispatching station to feedback the task information, the policeman who must support the task to perform the task must be immediately added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are too many gangs in the big and small, and the ghost knows that there will be some madmen who want to gain higher prestige by killing the police. This is not impossible. In the past, there were people who didn’t just shoot the police once to build their reputation for their gangs. This kind of vicious case against the police must be stopped. It is necessary not only to protect the life safety of police officers in carrying out their duties, but also to take into account the image of the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were eight police officers from the regional police station who sent four police cars to the school to reinforce the reinforcements. When the reinforcements arrived at the school, they saw four police officers being subdued. Under the teaching floor, and there are people watching them. The police officers immediately realized that this was likely to be a vicious and vicious case. The information from the scene was immediately fed back to the dispatching station, and the dispatcher dispatched a total of 25 police officers to reinforce it. Even the regional police chief Mason came over from home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that this case would set off a storm in the Tyrn area, he even prepared for the gun battle, but when he saw Du Lin, the bastard, holding his hands and squinting from the dark to the light, almost could not help but swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this bastard not in the west? When did you run back to Turner? And still doing something like this here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason licked his crotch while others were not paying attention. There was a thread that strangled the origin of life. He had a bit of pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went directly over the policeman and went to the school gate. A policeman behind him grabbed Mason’s arm. The policeman worked in the Tener area for several years. I have been working here since I graduated and have been working until today. He has seen the era of Director Prando, a dark age. Prando has laid down the rules of the underground world. Every month, every gang sends a black money to the police station in the name of paying a fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Prando will allocate half of the money to each police officer, and the other half is his own. At that time, the whole city of Tener looked very stable, there were no frequent criminal incidents, and there were few vicious cases, because everything was secretly solved in private. The tacit understanding between the gang and the regional police station even joined forces to let people living here see a false stability. He did not want to be confusing, but was excluded by the vast majority of police officers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was preparing to resign, Mason came. This sub-director, who looks like a fool, showed unparalleled financial resources. He was not corrupt, he did not accept black money, and he was very good to the police. Everyone liked him. After he was promoted to the head of the regional police station, he was supported by police officers throughout the Tener area. Of course, the police who had collected money were cleaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this police officer does not want Mason to take risks. In case of any accidents that he stood in front of him, it is a huge loss to the entire Tener area! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let loose, I know him...", Mason opened his hand behind his arm and strode toward Du Lin, at ten Under the illumination of several headlights, Mason walked up to Du Lin in front of the police car and lowered his voice and asked, "What do you want to do with this mixed ball? You are so passive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Linyi’s smile was two times. “Nothing, according to the process, it is to damage something, not a serious crime, even if it is the community volunteer service. "During the lawsuit, Du Lin gradually got a little understanding of how to sentence, as long as he admits his fault and positive compensation, the judge will forgive him. To know that he is just doing something wrong, these seemingly criminal acts are not criminal in the eyes of lawyers, and they have a way to offend Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the process is actually the easiest and most reliable method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure you are going to the police station for the night?", Mason asked again and again, after Du Lin nodded, he let people stuff them into the car. It was sent to the Tener Regional Police Station. It was just that Du Lin was not clear. He went to the police station and the most troublesome person who was not the police station, but the people in the joint investigation team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agent responsible for tracking and monitoring Doolin reported the situation to the investigation team, and the leaders of the investigation team immediately got a headache. If Doolin is arrested and imprisoned, Xiu En has just obtained the permission of Doolin to let him go to the west to find Du Lin after the end of the imperial capital. Does this mean that their work during this time has been done? It would be a bit too obvious to send Xiu En to the prison to accompany Du Lin. But if they don’t do anything, have they been sitting and waiting for Du Lin to be released from prison? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a view in the investigation team that people have not considered before, will it be that Du Lin deliberately wants to enter the police station or even be closed for three or five months? So avoid them. To know that Du Lin started his home in the city of Tener. In addition to the city of Otis in the empire, there is no place where the Bitnell Regional Prison is safer for Du Lin. He is not only threatened in the prison of Tener, but he can even control the outside association in the prison. At the same time, he interrupts the monitoring of the investigation team. This is not impossible. Du Lin is really treacherous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
