			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many wines did you brew in a month?" Du Lin pointed out that he was out of the factory and went out to the outside. He now has a wine taste. Alcohol is floating in the air, and I feel that my cheeks are getting hot. He is not particularly able to drink alcohol, so he is not very interested in drinking. He does not like things that cannot control his behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhodes sipped the puree in the cup and placed the cup on the side of the barrel. These barrels were dragon blood. Do, the original pulp will be poured into these wooden barrels. According to the required degree, after the stage is taken out, it can be bottled. The wooden barrel made of dragon blood can absorb impurities and water. Generally, the wine will be packed for about three days, and the higher one will have one week. After more than one week, the effect is extremely limited. Therefore, the method of brewing high-alcohol is to make the dragon blood wood into wood residue, and put it into the container and ferment together with the raw materials to directly absorb impurities and moisture in the process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed a few steps behind Du Lin’s body and whispered: “At that time, we could have up to 20,000 bottles per month, we supply About 70% to 80% of local demand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a place in Irian, almost consumed every day. A thousand bottles of wine, then the whole empire? Of course, there is no such thing as there are so many tourists here in Irian, but one hundred bottles a day can always be sold. There are 16 states and regions in the entire empire, more than 200 cities. If calculated according to this data, the empire consumes at least 20,000 bottles of wine every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this number is far lower than the real number, and in some prosperous cities, there may be more alcohol-containing beverages consumed per day than Irian. Excluding those areas where the relatively backward economy is not well developed, accounting for a quarter of the market share, it takes about 10,000 to 20,000 bottles a day, which is a very low conservative figure. The specific figures need to wait until the next batch of orders arrive, but Du Lin is very clear that this number is very low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue to expand the factory and strive to get 500,000 bottles of wine a month." Du Lin took out a cigarette and handed it to Rhodes. Dess even forgot to pick up the smoke in Du Lin's hands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One million bottles of wine a month? They used to produce more than 100,000 bottles of wine in the past year. Now the amount in a month is three or four times that of the previous year. Rhodes has a doubt. Can you really sell these wines every month? It is important to know that this wine is not the same as other businesses. Once the specific figures have been determined, it will be purchased in the market. This is a contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once there is a backlog of wine in a month, it means that there will be a backlog of funds soon. Because of the contract, those suppliers will continue to deliver the raw materials for the production of 500,000 bottles of wine on time and in volume. The food is very difficult to preserve, and Irian is still at the beach, the air is humid and cannot be stored for a long time. This means that even if their wine can't be sold, they have to continue to produce wine unless they pay compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his eyes moved, he realized that Du Lin had handed him a cigarette. He immediately bent down and said thank you, and put the cigarette on his mouth. Take out a box of matches for Du Lin to order first, then give yourself a point. After rubbing his arm, throwing the match and throwing it on the ground and stepping on it, Rhodes asked carefully. "Mr. Doolin, is this amount... will it be too much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then said: "And if you want to expand the factory, you need more land, at least four times now. We need warehouses to pile up raw materials and various things, small places If you do, you can't do anything. In other words, it is necessary to recruit more people to expand production..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin understood the meaning of Rhodes, one was afraid Wine can't be sold into a vicious circle. Second, it takes money to say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking back at the little land around the winery, Du Lin frowned. Whether it is the first district or the fifth district, or the middle of the district, the vacant land is already very tight. With the opening of the 8th district of Irian, and more and more people who are optimistic about the city, many vacant land has built houses. It is basically impossible to buy a large piece of open space. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can build a factory separately in several places, you can do it, but it does have a lot of trouble. Du Lin thought for a moment and let Rhodes go back first. Be prepared, he will go to the town hall to see if there is a better place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t say hello when he went to the City Hall, Scott wasn’t here, and the guy is staring at the eighth district every day. One is to supervise the construction progress, and the other is to coordinate some contradictions. With so many projects in the 8th District, there will be some contradictions or conflicts. For example, your family's garbage is on my side. His family's project blocks the sewage pipe of that family. In short, many things need him to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things seem to be very small things that can be handled badly and can easily become a big problem. Plus the workers' unions are all around the site, there must always be a talkative, and people with certain strength sit on the site to coordinate this. The mayor may not go, and only his confidant Scott went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he arrived at the town hall, Du Lin informed his name and the mayor immediately met him. As he thought, Du Lin has now become the biggest gold lord of the Irian City Hall in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s his jewelry store or a 20 million project under construction, or his winery, he can be a manager of the Irian area. Providing a large amount of funds to support their own governance concepts, Du Lin also can provide tens of thousands of jobs, and made outstanding contributions to the security and stability of the Irian region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayors of many places are obscured. They are not incapable, nor are they unwilling to do anything, but they have no money. For example, to build a road, it seems very simple to build a road. A phrase or a dozen letters can write this phrase on paper, which can be implemented and requires a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have money, for example, Irian, the mayor wants to build a road to build a road, and wants to repair a park to repair a park, then those poor, economically underdeveloped What about the city? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big Eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when I heard that Du Lin came personally, the mayor also personally greeted him. The last time Du Lin did not have such a good treatment, with his With more and more industrial layouts, his status is also rapidly increasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that you are busy, I will make a long story short.", Du Lin did not have any further chills, directly said the purpose of his trip, "I want to buy a little Land, used to expand the winery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor asked some doubts: "I didn't hear that you bought a large area of ​​land?" "Dulin's shaking his head is not enough. The mayor is even more surprised. "How many bottles of wine and barrels do you plan to produce each month?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin With one hand extended, he did not let the mayor to guess. It was a move that the idiot would do. "There are no plans for 500,000 bottles of wine and barrels of wine."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor’s eyebrows are picking up, and the face suddenly has some smiles. 500,000 bottles of wine, according to the principle of special tax payment currently implemented in the Irian area, he can do a little less tax, and calculate 50%, a bottle of wine earns 10 dollars, Du Lin must pay A tax of five dollars. There are 500,000 bottles, which is 2.5 million a month. Du Lin’s tax on one month has exceeded 50% of the total tax revenue in the Irian area. How could he be unhappy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
