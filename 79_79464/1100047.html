			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional things should be handed over to professional people. This is what Du Lin has experienced, but a woman who is as efficient and capable as Natiya is It is very rare. Doolin handed Mr. Jack to his list for Natiya. On the list, Du Lin had already contacted a few. Although he couldn’t say bad, he couldn’t say how good. To a certain extent, it is rooted in his insistence on the bottom line of the principle, but also lack of experience in negotiating with these international financial tycoons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These merchants are wild dogs that have been hungry for three months, talk to them about their ideals, talk about the big picture, and talk about the overall plan. It’s not meaningful, you have to see one by one. And verify that the benefits can really be handy to continue to talk. They are not politicians. Sometimes Du Lin thinks it is easier to chat with politicians. Even the most realistic and selfish politicians will have an ideal side. If they find their ideals and find the key points, they will bow their heads. Only these capitalists are different. Their only ideal and pursuit is to see money, otherwise don't say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya’s skills in this area are many times higher than Du Lin’s. She is the former Minister of Public Relations of the former South Commercial Bank and the former senior Partner, now the public relations department of the South Commercial Bank is almost her "student", her experience in the financial field is extraordinary, and the people that Du Lin handed over to her list can almost talk about it. Only one did not agree, but the other party did not say a word, saying that they can continue to talk, but the premise is that Doolin must be present in person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the problem with this person?", Du Lin looked at the information in his hand, and Natiya took more than two days to find the person's information. Out, she also has some friends on the federal side, including the previous relationship in the bank can still be used. In fact, this is not to say that Natiya has the ability or charm to maintain these relationships. People know her and make friends with her not because of her own, but because she is standing behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she said that she left the South Commercial Bank, but she is standing behind Du Lin, her value in this society has not been reduced by leaving South Commercial Bank. Those friends are naturally willing to continue to maintain this friendship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This customer is very good, called Sidel, the ship king tycoon of the Principality of Farolanco, holding more than 170 freighters in his hands, all over the trade routes Throughout the world, the entire import and export trade of Farolanco is almost in his hands. In Farolanco, his power of wealth was almost unmatched. Even the current King Lutheran VII of the Principality was not seen by him. Sometimes he would openly ugly to the kings of the Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourteen percent of the entire Farolanco Principality is private. It can be said that he has controlled a certain degree of national economy to a certain extent. It is not only a nobleman, but also has a good relationship with the military of the Principality. Close contact is a difficult role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a lot of spare cash in his hands, there is no place to use it, it is rotted in the bank, this time Mr. Jack of the Principality of Farolanco said this thing casually, this The ship king immediately came to the interest and expressed his willingness to join the game. In fact, it is no fun to make money for people like him. He enjoys the wonderful experience brought by the rapid secretion of adrenaline. Nothing can be more interesting than the finance of a country. It is straightforward. It’s just hunting, and I’m willing to spend a lot of money on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya talked with him briefly, but the effect is not good. First of all, this rich and powerful ball thinks that Doolin is not going to talk to him. Look down on him, of course, this is a common problem for the nobility. I always feel that all non-aristocratic classes are maliciously targeting themselves. He told Natiya that if he wants to let him in, then Du Lin must talk to him. What he needs is The principal of Doolin is not a cat, a dog or a dog. This is to respect his proper performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin listened to her while reading the information. At the end, she threw the information on the table and leaned back. She extended her finger and clicked on the information. How much is this guy going to invest?" A few days ago, he burned out two billions of federal shields for the sake of the game. If you can get a little more money, it is obviously the best. In the case where the overall situation has been decided, it is best to be able to draw more benefits! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natiya was a little hesitant, and said: "He showed me a copy of the 500,000 federal shield of the Federal Bank..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a sip of cold, 500 million federal shield, according to the current exchange rate, it is almost close to 150 million stars, this earth nobles actually So rich? His eyes quickly focused on that information. Perhaps this is also a normal thing. A nobleman has mastered one-eighth of the country's wealth, and it is not too much to get a 500 million federal shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, too much. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you simply talk about total assets, the Empire and the Federation have more than his capitalists and consortia, but can take so much cash without gasping, then It is really rare. The more total assets a company has, the higher the market value, and the stricter the control over liquidity. A company with a total asset of one million yuan should maintain normal operation, and the liquidity should not be lower than 200,000. In addition to the necessary expenses, there is a part of the risk of preparing for the risk that may occur whenever and wherever possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few companies that can take out so much money in one breath, except for banks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin indulged for a moment, and he decided to meet with the rich Nanda Road natives, and the time was agreed tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night in the corner of the city - a very federal restaurant with lots of fresh food, all without any cooking methods. Add a little spice or dipping sauce and eat the raw ones. This restaurant is said to have a history of more than two hundred years. The boss and the cook are in the same vein. The seven generations have been passed down to this day and have become a famous trademark and even a city attraction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This restaurant is located in the city centre, and it is very interesting that the restaurant is not in some high-rise buildings, but in an early architectural style. It is also possible to see some of the old houses unique to the Empire. This restaurant has only six tables, each in a separate room. This also allows many people to enjoy the food even if they have money, because they only accept "special people", or the right. Of course, in order to show their own people, every day they will draw three lucky ones at the number they want to dine at the front desk, so that the general class can also enjoy the food here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was able to book a table. Thanks to Mr. Kaile, Mr. Keller had a phone call and the restaurant agreed. They have prepared spare rooms and dining tables for the occasional needs. There are always some big people who suddenly want to eat something here. It may be a big deal for the big guys. For this restaurant, it is necessary. Prepare things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin arrived, the rich man had not come yet, the room was small, the decoration was very beautiful, similar to the style about a hundred years ago, from The period in which the empire transformation was derived from the process of belonging to the federal own style. There are some simplicity in luxury, and there are some euphemisms at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting for about ten minutes, Mr. Cai was late. He heard his laughter when he didn't enter the door, and he was full of confidence. The moment the door was opened, his gaze and Du Lin’s gaze gathered together. The two men looked at each other for a few seconds. The rich man immediately released his female companion and went to Du Lin. The two looked at each other. After some time, I just shook hands and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin doesn't like this person very much, he is too strong, too aggressive, but thinking of the money in this guy's pocket, Du Lin thinks he can still sit down and talk A chat. The two introduced themselves. This is the landlord of Alan Duy, who is from the Principality of Farolanco. He is forty-seven years old this year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
