			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is obviously not a joke, he has always done this, he believes that bullets are more binding than words, ethics, integrity, dreams, etc. because Human life is only once and still very fragile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha smiled and said nothing, she took the spoon and stirred the open mushroom soup that had just been sent, the rich milk and mushrooms and the aroma of corn. Together, it exudes a fascinating taste. She knew that Doolin was not a joke, but now she needs some help, and she has not much left. Although Nasha has not understood why her grandfather, Mr. John, has paid a big price for the theater, and his brothers and sisters have not given her this sect. The only thing she can do now is the handle. The two tape companies are operating well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure clear readability and higher recognition, another company has changed its name to "Star Empire Media Company" to face more and more Investors are looking at the pressure on the tape market. According to the financial report of the last quarter of last year, the profit of the two companies in each quarter has some obvious increase compared with the third quarter. The total cost of the tape is excluding various expenses, and the net profit is 270,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This number does not seem to be much, but the profit from value-added services is far more profitable than the simple tape business. The net profit brought by advertising and some special programs is about 620,000, which adds up to the one million mark in the first quarter. The management of the two companies met before the meeting. At this meeting, everyone thought that these incomes will have more obvious growth in the new year, and they will encounter more challenges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a good side, so naturally there is a bad side. Now there are 17 tape media companies in the whole empire. Some are looking for innovation and want to break through the current mainstream content, but some companies have given up their own innovation and copied the contents of the Empire Star. If it is in a new one. If you can't continue to lead the content in the year, you may encounter failure. At the same time, the tree of the George family was lost. There were some impetuous atmospheres on the top of the company. Some executives had the idea of ​​leaving the company. They were able to be called by Nasha as her subordinates, not because she had excellent ability to convince others, but behind her back against the big tree of the George family. Now that the tree has fallen, there are so many challenges and pressures. It is obviously normal to want to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not everyone is pursuing challenges to break through the limits, and some people only want a stable life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which side of the high-level personnel changes, it is very likely that a tsunami will swept the two companies, which is what Nasha absolutely does not want to see, she It is also necessary to rely on these two companies to revitalize the glory of the George family. So she wants to ask Du Lin, what can be done to manage her industry efficiently, but it is clear that Du Lin’s answer has made her unable to continue this topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can’t do it, she won’t have to meet Du Lin if she can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly changed a topic, looking out the window of the deserted street, and asked: "Where do you think the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Future?", Du Lin shakes the napkin over the neckline, picks up the spoon and sip a spoonful of mushroom soup. "If I were you, I would pack the two companies." Sold to those who are wielding checks who want to enter the industry, they will offer a price that will satisfy you for the two companies with good business and high market share. Then take the money and find some solid investment. Going to a small business that doesn't hurt the foundation, or simply looking for someone to marry a rich life, this is the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not optimistic I?", Nasha put down the spoon, showing a very serious look, she was a bit angry, she did not like Du Lin's statement and her "goodwill", could not help but retorted: "If this year's business situation There can be a steady improvement, as long as we can continue to operate, we will be paying next year. At the time of the listing, there will be more money to open up the market and fight against other companies. Maybe we will become the dominant party in this field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Du Lin looked very serious and nodded. "That's what you said!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very disdainful, Nasha sees Draw the figure that he doesn't care about in his eyes, why? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, because the emergence of cable TV will inevitably eliminate the tape, which has just disappeared in a few years, and is newer, faster, more and more accurate. As soon as it appears, the cable TV will be able to kill all the tape companies. Compared to the monthly fee of about one hundred dollars, in exchange for the tape that is updated ten days, cable TV can see new content anytime, anywhere, and the media that does not need to pay more for it is real. Mainstream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the magical world of Doolin's dream that has a kind of network, countless traditional media media have disappeared from the Internet. Only cable TV can develop healthily, and even in some areas, you can come to the Internet. I am fighting some. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that the value and potential of cable TV can be said to be infinite, and it has absolute dominance before the emergence of the Internet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he would not say that the attitude of Mr. John and Mr. Mark made him very disappointed, so he dug a pit and let the giant fall. Then the other giants pushed him down the abyss. He didn't get the wealth of the George family in full, but now he has been very satisfied with what he has in his mouth. He will not give Nasha for any reason, or give the George family a chance to turn over. That is a stupid thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin no longer speaks to Nasha’s complicated feelings that are difficult to describe, wants to know, and does not want to ask Du Lin, she can only use this emotion in Not a hearty lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha had asked some of Doolin’s attention to media companies and the new open source. In this regard, Du Lin did not mind telling her her own ideas. The destined failure will be more brilliant before the failure, and the more the value and significance of the new era will be reflected. Just like fireworks, people will always remember only the most splendid one, never think about how much money has disappeared under this beautiful scenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meal, Nasha invited Du Lin to go to the company for a turn, Du Lin was idle, and after considering it, he agreed to Nasha’s request. Nasha’s doing this is actually purposeful. She may not be able to do the same thing as Dulin’s saying, “I don’t obey the rules and die,” but she can use Du Lin’s prestige to make some people who are speculatively quiet. Come down. She does not need such a false silence to last as long as one year, one year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this year’s earnings report, she will submit it to several famous financial auditing companies in Xie Lisi Street for review, and then actively seek listing. Once you successfully list any one, the other one can follow the listing. With two listed companies and strong financial strength, Nasha is confident that she can win all the next wars in this field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time Dolin appeared in the Star of the Empire, many people have forgotten the work in their hands, and the opportunities for the old club and the new club are not at the same time. More common, especially they all know how much effort Du Lin put into this tape company, almost every project is proposed and perfect, but finally did not know what was sold to Nasha. In this case, the two people can appear together, and it seems that there has not been a quarrel. It really makes people feel shocked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
