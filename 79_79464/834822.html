			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mayor, recently came a lot of foreigners in the city, it doesn't look like anything...good guys!", Thomson is as much as possible The mayor kept his own demeanor in front of the adults, and did not say dirty words, but instead replaced them with good people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is right, the huge development value and potential of the city has been faintly revealed, especially when the Celi people have completed the tax certificate and After the documents were unimpeded and sent to the place where they were to be sent, all the smugglers were shocked. The original smuggling can still be played like this! Although it will lose a lot of profits, it will be more important to never be stable. One of the ten smugglings failed. The money they earned from the organization is basically lost. If there are two failures, they may be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like Selena’s delivery, the profit of a bottle of sixteen dollars looks very amazing, but in fact the money is not an organization boss Human, he must take the big head, others must take the small head, while also reserve a part to prepare to open some joints at any time. However, if there is a problem in the process of transportation, then only the boss is responsible for the loss. Other members of the organization may not "crowd up" a batch of goods to make up for the loss of the boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, although the profit has been reduced by half, the safe and stable channel has attracted everyone’s attention. If this road can be saved, at least for the next five years, they will not Need to consider expanding the manpower, and spend more money to get through the various joints, just pull things to Otis and pay a tax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a convenient channel, it is destined that the future of Otis is brilliant, so some organizations have begun to send representatives to Otis to occupy a place, so that There is a certain right to speak in this special world of the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are really not good people, can smugglers have a few good people? These guys who walk around the edge of survival and death often do not know what to do, and even if they kill people, they will not be afraid. At most, it is better to lift people up and find an inconspicuous place. Even if this kind of person pretends to be a kind of sly, there is absolutely no possibility of kindness and kindness, more like a hungry wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of these people disturbed the quiet life of Otis. Some people found Thomson who often went to the city hall. I hope he can talk to the mayor. Is it because these people are taken away? These people swayed around the street all day, and also played a little girl, so that some of the old people here were very angry. These people should not be here, they should be in the garbage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomson conveyed the "petition" of people very much to Doolin. After listening to Du Lin, he thought for a moment and said "I know it" and let Thomson leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the result of the local compatriots not cooperating with him. Since those people are satisfied with the status quo and are not willing to be manipulated, they can only endure this situation for the time being. There are still up to five days, and these things can be completely solved, because the Carter people are coming. But this does not mean that the good days of the locals are coming, the result will be completely opposite! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Thomson got out, Doolin continued to look down and looked at some of the things recorded in the book. He once thought that a city’s governing body didn’t have to The exaggerated building can only be understood when he is his own. When you stand in front of a building that is so solemn and cumbersome that you feel small and burdened with heavy pressure, and... standing in front of this four-story building that can be called a dangerous building, the state of mind is Absolutely different! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you are arrogant, you must converge on your bad temper in front of the former, even if you encounter some unbearable situation, you will endure With. But the latter... seems to be the place where such people preach their existence, and the unconstrained architecture will lower the value and grade of the workers in the building. Recall the city hall of Irian, and recall the city hall of Tenell, which is a solemn building without exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the first thing Du Lin wanted to repair was the City Hall, and he was fed up here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he is definitely not for his own enjoyment, absolutely not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the map of the city and looked at the messy plan with a little liver pain. To be honest, the current urban planning of Otis is chaotic, but it occupies It's a good place, it's like a reverse "D", the old town is at the bottom of the bowl. Whether it is light or wind or living, it is pleasant. If you re-open a new urban plan across the old town, it will not only cost a lot, but the environment is not as good as this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to demolition? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin touched his chin, and some of the scorpions began to poke their hands. After all, they are already 19 years old according to the age of the virtual, and they are considered adults. It seems that the guy in Buddhism doesn't have a long beard. He really admires the smooth chin and doesn't need to take care of it all day. Thinking about thinking, I started to drive the car. After a while, he thought of Mrs. Vivian and the child of the Buddha.... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not all of them push the door in, he may have to think about it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Du Lin’s face like a smile, he’s already laughing in his eyes, and he looks down at his dress and pats a few under. He stretched his hands and turned around, and asked inexplicably: "I have something on my body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin walked back to the chair while shaking his head and sat down He leaned back and looked at the Buddha. "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Buddha, even Keelen must knock on the door. Because the guy has not yet passed the certification of Du Lin, there are only a few people who are currently honored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Buddha went straight to Du Lin and sat down, rubbing his legs and throwing out cigarettes, "Andy brothers came..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andylin brothers are heterogeneous in the nano- Lindes, they are not smuggling, but their income and smuggling are closely related, simply they are the kind of rut. When you encounter a soft persimmon, you can pinch it. If you treat those who are more powerful than them, you will treat the other person as a grandfather. But it's just such a unpleasant guy, and it's very good at Nano Lindes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will not swallow after they have robbed the goods. After all, they have no channels to smuggle and buy, and they are not willing to do this business. They will draw a certain amount of income and then help the other party to send these things to their destination. To put it bluntly, it is an alternative protection fee. Many small forces are not willing to fight for the loss of the interests of the Andy brothers. They do not harm the interests of the big forces and they cannot see them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cleverly found a seam for themselves to fit, it belongs to the kind of guy who hates them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about thirty people in their hands, one of them is a savage person, and everyone is getting used to their existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people come to Otis, needless to say, just to find a place to live here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are smart enough not to touch the official transporter, they know that they can’t afford it, they used to live in the middle of Nam Lindes because there is Their source of intelligence can know who has loaded in what car. Now those smugglers are planning to put the smuggling base in the city of Otis. Some people even discussed that the smuggled steam locomotive did not stop at Nam Lindes, and then directly unloaded the goods to Otis, forcing them to transfer their positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Du Lin, he nodded and nodded. He randomly picked his fingers. "A few days someone will come over and arrange to stare at them. If necessary, you can warn them first." If the warning is invalid, send them back to the embrace of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this is the biggest difference between Doolin and other officials, other officials will still think about finding another group of people to check the gang, or drive the tiger Wolf, or killing people by knife, how can Du Lin be indiscriminate, the other party may just have to look at it and think about killing each other? Perhaps it is because Du Lin is so unreasonable, so it is possible to suppress these people before the rules are established. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dudu nodded and understood that he just thought about standing up, his butt off the chair, and sat back again. "What’s in the box? What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kinna tells him that he is a fish, and Buddha believes it, and thinks that Kea’s brain may not be very good. But the problem now is that he thinks that the box is not a fish, which is equivalent to his own brain is not very good, coupled with curiosity, he wants to know why Du Lin is willing to take the base. To know what they are doing, none of them are in line with the rules, which is destined to be difficult for outsiders to truly integrate into this group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to ask yourself and tell you a secret, that guy is not very resistant to women!" Du Lin kicked the ball back to Dufford. At the same time, I also want to verify whether Keina can get his own trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you say that Du Lin does not bring with him? It is because the Buddha has been outside since he was very young. He has seen a lot of scenes, and he has been sitting in prison. He is still very clever. Guess Du Lin’s mind is also very accurate. Therefore, Du Lin took him with him. Some things can be understood, but they must not be said. If he changed Jose, he might have been asking all the time. If he changed Ellis, he might really go find a few girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing to worry about! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, people who had just awakened from their sleeps came out of the house and saw the notice posted on the outside wall. The literacy rate in the city of Otis is generally not high, so there is a crowd of people crowded together in the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a notice..." Deville looked at the notice on the wall and read it to everyone in a way that everyone can understand. “The City Hall plans to rebuild the city, and half of the houses will be demolished and rebuilt... Start with the city center!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
