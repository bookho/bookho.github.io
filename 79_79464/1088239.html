			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jov watched his uncle pick up his arm to beat Diniya, but he also had a little gloom because his uncle said Now in this family he is the master of the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence made Joe very unhappy. Everyone knows that the home of the Hill family is a waste, except for the day when they are fooled by the technical women who are kneeling. Together, I have never done anything useful at all. In addition to his very good work in evading reality, what contribution does he make to the family? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, those skilled women are arranged by him, but his uncle can refuse, he is the owner of the Hill family but indulges I can't extricate myself, and I put everything on my body. At this time, I want to stand up and show my authority? Secretly sneered, Joe recalled his attention from the owner. Anyway, he was a waste. Compared with his "disrespect" on the verbal, his two cousins ​​really told others about their rebellion. Seriously threatened his authority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slap in the expectation was not drawn on Dini’s face, the door of the conference room was pushed away at this time, and the butler couldn’t help but squeeze out a strong laugh. Standing by the door, this group of guests was too fucking. Not only did he not follow the arrangement of the host family, but also beaten two servants and threatened him to enter the conference room forcibly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unexpected stranger let the owner raise his arm and take it back. Although he is a jerk, he is a fool who is not thinking about making progress and fooling around with women all the time, but the aristocrats in the bones. The thing has not been lost. He knows that if this slap in the face of an outsider, he will lose the decent appearance of the Hill family. This is the only thing they have now, he will not do that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the young man who was coming in with a sullen look. He knew this young man, Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s name almost resounded throughout the emperor during this time, as long as the individual has heard of the name. Although the Hill family has already lost, the people at home have always been concerned about the outside dynamics, and even more concerned than the ordinary nobility. They once considered the marriage with Doolin to crack the current situation, but the idea was finally abandoned by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is very simple. Although Du Lin has a good hand, it is not the person they need. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s business, no matter how fast or how much money he makes, is very messy and has no similarities with Hill’s family business, nor can he help from the front or side. To the industry of Hill. Secondly, Du Lin was born as an ordinary civilian. He did not play a pivotal role in the aristocratic circle and could not change the predicament faced by the family. In the end, Du Lin was a dangerous person. This is a comment on him in the aristocratic circle. There are even rumors that he created a derailment incident to retaliate against the princess of the big public. This is simply a lawless and arrogant, Hill home. The trouble has been enough, I don't want to find another trouble to come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea is finally extinguished, so they know Dulin better than the average person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s very rude to break into a place where someone shouldn’t be in someone’s home...”, the owner turned and looked at Doolin, slightly Holding his chin, his eyes showed an arrogant emotion. The nobility is a nobleman, even if it is a lonely aristocrat, it is far more noble than a civilian. "I don't care about your rude behavior, but please leave here now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Don't wait for what Du Lin said, Diana, who was afraid of closing her eyes, opened her eyes and saw Du Lin, immediately ran to Du Lin, grabbed his arm and hid behind him, revealing a head. Hate said, "He just wanted to hit me, you are really coming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This series of accidents is not the owner, even Joe It was faintly found that something was wrong. He looked at Diniya, who was hiding behind Du Lin, and screamed. "Is this your reliance?" The more he said, the more angry he was, the more normal things became. Unrecognized, his majesty in the family is constantly being provoked, and the two cousins ​​are also out of his control, and even more so that he feels terrible is the share of the empire central bank. If the two sisters do not transfer this part of the shares to him, he really has no way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, maybe he really wants to lose the position of the owner, don’t look at the uncles who seem to be very convinced and support him as the owner, but it’s really the choice. They will definitely fall to the side of interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many years of planning and preparations are in jeopardy, and Joe’s biting his teeth caused his two gangs to bulge. He pushed the chair up and stood up. Going to a place very close to Doolin, a slight squint, suddenly reached out and grabbed Diniya behind Du Lin. This is their family business. Du Lin is just an outsider. If he does not want to be a special group of nobles, he is best not to interfere with their family affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't look at the nobles who are now targeting their Hill family all day, but when a civilian stands up to challenge the order of the nobility, and even wants to break into the tradition of the nobility, all the nobles will stand up to deal with Doolin. At this time, he had a lot of excitement. He even had a chance to expect Du Lin to start. At that time, he was able to design and annex the industry of Doolin, and with the shares of the central bank in hand, the Hill family could immediately return to the peak! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, in the sight of Joe, there is a black dot getting bigger and bigger, the expression on his face is getting more and more frightened, a sole from Doolin quickly appeared behind and covered most of his sight... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, Joe knocked over one of his elders and sat down at the table, slamming twice on the tiptoe. . Now he wears leather shoes when he goes in and out. He doesn't think there is any inconvenience in the usual time, but when he just got out of this ankle, he felt that wearing leather shoes was far less comfortable than wearing sneakers. It was a little lame, and it still looks like it is still Change back to sneakers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a black bodyguard around Du Lin closing the door of the conference room, and Du Lin walked over to the owner, pointing to the vacancy left by Di Nija. "Please sit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The homeowner’s temples swelled, and he felt that Doolin was crazy, staring at Du Lin for a while, and came silently. Dinesa sat down in the position, and he wanted to see what Du Lin wanted to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Du Lin looked at the wolverine Joe, and Joe held half of his face, his eyes reflected the luster of resentment. The two looked at each other for a moment. He leaned back and regained his position. The situation is a bit strange, and he can't understand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe’s move made Du Lin very satisfied. He nodded and sat in the position of the owner. Although everyone thought it was ridiculous. But no one can laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am here to announce two things!", Du Lin duangduang's two feet on the table, a pair of unattended attitude, he stretched out Two fingers and one stroke, "The first thing, starting today, the home of the Hill family will be shared by Dinisha and Dini."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The face of the owner is more gloomy, making him look like a sick patient all year round, his face is extremely unhealthy. His sullen lips were smashed, his eyes covered with bloodshot eyes, but he was able to hold his breath, did not stand up and loudly refuted Doolin, telling him that he had no power to decide the leadership of the Hill family. Whose hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
