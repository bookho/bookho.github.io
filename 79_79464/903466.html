			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old veterans of the North are a force to be reckoned with. These nobles have lost their titles of nobility, but their social class has never changed. They just lost control of their territory and lost their lives and murders for ordinary people, but they are still economic and political, they are still former aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hot silver stamp on this document belongs to the hymn family and should now be called the sacred consortium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This family is said to have existed for a long time. Their ancestors were not imperial aristocrats, but pastors. As for why a pastor would become a nobleman, according to the hymn family themselves. It is said that their ancestors healed an acute disease that broke out at the time. In order to thank the pastor for his outstanding contribution to the empire, the emperor enshrined the priest to become an empire's nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the origin of the hymn family. It has been from the beginning of the aristocracy to today, and the wealth and connections accumulated over hundreds of years are enough to give them a lot of power. If it wasn't for Magus's success to overthrow the decaying old rule, perhaps they wouldn't need to "please" to Doolin and directly order Du Lin to give up a gambling card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a troublesome thing. The trouble is not that the other party has strong financial resources, but the relationship they have in their hands. Once Doolin decides to reject their request, they may find Harry's head, or even Magus's head, to put pressure on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some people have said, the nobility is always a nobleman, always wearing a pair of pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has some troubles to put down the file, it’s absolutely impossible to get a full gambling card, the gambling card and the rules he made for the city are maintained The fundamental of his interests is to maintain the foundation of the city in accordance with his planned route. There is absolutely no compromise. And some things are not because the specific content can not be compromised, for the sake of position, for their own decent and majestic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you compromise because today’s opponent is an old aristocrat from the North, what do people think of him? Maybe I think Du Lin is actually a guy who is bullying and hard-working. He can refuse the demands of the capitalists righteously. He also said that it is impossible to have a wholly-owned casino. When he turns around, he will give the gambling hand to the hymn, which will make him There is a gap with all the supporters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe there will be another large consortium asking for a gambling card tomorrow, and another consortium will appear the day after tomorrow. In the end, he will not only throw his face in, but his reputation will sweep the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in any case, you must clench your teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the situation is not bad to that extent, he is only the worst plan he is doing, with his plan agreed with Magus and others, Before the thorough implementation, Magus would not move him, nor would he give him too much pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other party is willing to follow the rules, he does not mind to accommodate a loud name into the core circle of Otis. But if the other party does not intend to follow the rules, he will also teach the other person how to behave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being let go of this document, he suddenly looked up and saw Dove standing on one side. "You can go find a news officer for us, as soon as possible!" Duron turned the second document when he watched Dove leave the office to execute his orders. This is a plan for the city's public transportation route. The public transportation company needs the mayor's final signature to be able to completely determine the route... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time outside the window behind Doolin, in the corner of the street, Hagson was sitting in a restaurant and was being interviewed by Alice. For Hargerson, there is a delicious complimentary breakfast in the morning, and there are also beautiful people on the side, it is definitely a pleasant morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think is the most distinctive place in the city?", Alice’s eyes sparkled with a glimmer of satisfaction, and it’s clear that this young man Mayor Doolin had to do a lot of work. Under her guidance, this young staff member has begun to cooperate with her ideas. Although I feel that this guy's temperament is a little different from the average person, it has been ignored by her during the interview with great news value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She still needs to continue to guide, this young man will keep up with his "rhythm" and say what he needs," I heard about the northern part of the empire Many people regard this as a new paradise, is that the case?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagson nodded with the cup of the coffee cup, "It is true, There are many opportunities here, whether it is a worker or a businessman, you can find the possibility to realize your dream here. The Empire Dream is not far away, just beside us, as long as you are willing to reach out, you may touch Go to it!", Hageson smiled and put the cup into the cup and saucer and licked some wet lips. "This is the biggest difference from other places. Anyone can find opportunities and hopes from here." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice’s awkward gaze woke up with the return of Harmonson’s voice. She thought that this young man would say something exciting, but he didn’t expect him to say such an official statement, which made her a bit suspicious. Is it wrong to lead myself, or this guy's brain has been washed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She laughed and continued to ask: "I heard some news that I don’t know where it came from. It is said that the mayor of the city is some Illegal business acts as a umbrella, and it is because of this behavior that they will invest more here, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagson reveals some surprises The expression, "God is on, I don't know where you heard these terrible rumors, but I think that with the reporter's IQ, you should be able to understand the truth of these rumors. This is simply impossible. The thing, as I said earlier, people invest here because it is full of unprecedented potential and hope. As for what illegal business you are talking about, there is no such thing here."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does not exist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice herself is a bit confused, she has said very well, even said something she should not say, can see the other party’s reaction... ..., did I get it wrong when I collected the information? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Alice’s brain was a bit confused. She decided that no matter what the guy named Hargerson said, she took a few pages before picking up the book. I found some stimulating topics and then asked: "I have read several reports and I have learned some facts. In the past, Mayor Doolin had instructed the police chief, Hai Te, to kill in the lobby of the Imperial Bank. Some innocent citizens, what do you think about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagson smiled and shook his head. "Ms. I think your interview position has A big problem, first of all, I must tell you that an ordinary person makes fake news, and a mayor of a city makes a series of fake news. The legal ruling is different. The former may only need to compensate some reputation. Loss of fees, but the latter you may face jail time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't come to Otis at the time of the incident, but I am doing this. Have a more realistic understanding, it is said that some deported citizens and The Director of the Bureau of Investigation, Hite, had a conflict and attempted to seize the Hite Director’s pistol and attack him. After the warning was invalid, the police officers around Hite’s police officers were not taken away to protect the pistol and the safety of the Secretary of the Hite. Those thugs." The expression on his face was very serious. He had no previous smile. "The injured person died on the way to Nal Lindes because of excessive blood loss and returned to the embrace of God. As for what you listen to. Those who say are just rumors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Alice was reluctant to continue to "interview", but Hagson did not give her this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the napkin and dipped his lips, then stood up, very politely owed the debt, "Thank you very much for your generous hospitality, my working hours." You should know that as a member of the City Hall, we have a strict schedule. In order to avoid being troubled by my boss, I have to take a step!", he glanced at the watch on his wrist, sly The diamond reflects the light of the hedgehog in the sunlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coffee is very pure, muffins are delicious, goodbye!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at Kazakhstan When Aegis left, Alice suddenly felt that she had made a mistake. When she returned, the waiter had already smiled and stood aside. "Respected lady, you are cash. Payment, or check payment?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the glaring number on the bill, Alice has a desire to go crazy, she flipped the handbag and put it in the end Several coins and a five-piece banknote were photographed on the table, and they stood up and walked toward the door. After two steps and then came back, I picked up the coffee that had not been finished on the table and the unsweetened muffins gorged and ate, and glanced at the waiter and quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is over, and even the tolls that have been returned are gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald was a bit strange when he met Hagson at the door of the town hall. The smile on the guy’s face gave a kind of...just like the thief stole the valuable The joy of property, he could not help but rely on the past to ask, "What is so happy?" After the two "relaxed" together that night, the relationship immediately rapported a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagson looked back at the restaurant in the distance, shrugged his shoulders, "I met a fool!", I couldn't help but laugh. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, Alice is a fool in his opinion. Although Hageson has his own arrogance, he also has a kind of arrogance that he can’t look down on, but he It was born of aristocrats and was born of a great aristocrat. He knows when to say something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can say Du Lin’s bad words, and then bear the consequences, and there may be problems with the family’s plans for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
