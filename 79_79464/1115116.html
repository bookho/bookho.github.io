			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck’s education is not high. After finishing high school, he did not continue to study. On the one hand, there is no shortage of labor in the family to earn money to support the family. Secondly, the family’s love is piled up. On this youngest son. Since he is not willing to go to school, then he will not go to school. Anyway, the eldest son and daughter will make money outside, and the younger son is still young, so it is right to let him play more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Buck used the time that should have been used in school, while other children were still studying hard, and they learned to sleep late at night. At the time, he talked to the young lady who had a feeling in the bar. When others can't wait to live in the library and absorb all the knowledge into their heads, he is driving a new car on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s even more ridiculous is that when other students graduated and found a good job, he has been in the city hall for more than a year, and Still have a little power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is life, fucking life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s clear that Buck is also clearly aware of the importance of learning. Managing a city is not just a matter of management, resource adjustment, policy The research behind this requires a certain level of expertise as the basis, and this is exactly what Buck does not have. He wants to join Du Lin's core circle, then he has to show his own value. People who have no value are not worth investing. He believes that Du Lin is also sure of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he feels that maybe he should go back to school and learn how he can better help his work now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told Du Lin about these words, Du Lin thought about it or nodded, and longing for knowledge is a journey that everyone must have experienced, though To a large extent, 99% of this knowledge is worthless in the future of life. At this time, there will always be some impulsiveness and ideals, which cannot stop him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After agreeing to help Buck to contact a school, Buck was very happy. After maintaining a certain degree of awe and Du Lin’s farewell, there was only one Dulin in the room. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He patted the leather seat of the sofa, he struggled in the city for more than a year, changing a city with almost no vitality It became the pearl of the hinterland of today's empire. He thought that this would be the starting point of his life stage, but he suddenly realized that it was just a blisters rising from the surface of the water. It always looked so real before the blisters burst, so it looks good and knows it slams. When the cracks become air, it makes people react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not enough solid foundation. The city of Otis is not enough to be the stage for him to display his ambitions. Therefore, he took the opportunity to leave. There are always some inexplicable embarrassments when returning here. Perhaps this is the common problem after people are old and like to remember the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of Lindes, not far from the city of Otis, Mr. Merlin was born to arrange their wedding scene with his fiancee, Ms. Su Rui. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin is more like a routine than Suri’s enthusiasm. He stood by the cold table next to the wedding scene, and some fruit and snacks were placed on the table, which were prepared for the staff. He grabbed a local fruit with a small thumb and watched Suri, who was directing the workers to set the stage. He couldn’t lift the excitement in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had thought for a while that Du Lin would not be right in everything, especially Du Lin thought that Suri was the best for his wife. The candidate is on this matter. After Suri's first abortion, they fell into a cold war, and Merlin announced a breakup. After living in this big city for two years, he is not the stupid guy who has just learned anything from the country. He has his own views on the city, on people's lives, on trends and fashion. He does not think that a woman who loves vanity will be her best companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he quickly plunged into another relationship, but unfortunately, this relationship quickly fell through. The reason is not on the woman, but on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin is a typical inner-slung scum male. He does not feel the performance of his scum male from the appearance and normal interaction, but the relationship is deeper. I can feel that he is not quite the same value as other male members of the Kemma family in dealing with women. He will have a stable female companion to support his positive image, then make more female friends and sway his hormones on the back of the sun. After his second lover found out that he was on two boats, he gave him a slap in the air to pack things away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if he sent some valuable luxury goods to the other party, even if he bought a car, these are not enough for the girl to change his mind and tell him on the phone. She was bitten by a dog, and this dog is still licking her now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the scum males will have a hidden potential machismo spirit, and the so-called fallen Merlin will naturally not be doing anything to squint. Then he found Su Rui, which is the most prominent feature of the scum, they are good at using spare tires. In the process of this exchange, Merlin had to admit that Du Lin was right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suri apparently knew that he would be confused with other women before going home at night, and he would remain silent and give him the greatest tolerance and gentleness. Does she really love him, of course not, as Merlin himself knows, this is just what they need. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to live in a high society, wants a rich life, wants envy from other relatives and even strangers, then she must maintain Live this relationship and marry into the giants. Therefore, even if Merlin had some places that were not enough to check, Su Rui had a blind eye and passed away. As long as she still had all of this, she still enjoyed and pursued it. Nothing was too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin had to admit that Du Lin looked very accurate when looking at the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was coming back from his face, his face was suddenly full of smiles, and he put his little fruit on the table and smiled and went to Su Rui. past. He took Su Rui's waist very naturally and kissed her on the cheek. "Dear, what's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suri seems to be unaware Out of the composition of Merlin's acting, she said with a slight hesitation, pointing to the stage, "Do you say that we use a light pink background, or a pure white background?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; In the envious eyes of the staff, this pair of formerly loving couples is really suitable, they are so sweet when they are together, maintaining such a high frequency of harmony, a truly enviable pair! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as it is what you like, you can!", Merlin is almost a true performance, giving a very appropriate answer, Su Rui is very happy to let the staff The pure white background was replaced by pale pink, and it was commanded for a while. The two went to a bench and made a bad moment and took a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Rui took out a small package of snacks from the pocket of his clothes, took a bite out of the package and suddenly asked, "You said Du Lin will come to participate." Our wedding, is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of Doolin, along with his viral propaganda, has almost made everyone in the entire empire know "Duringin Heroes" This new phrase also knows why he is called a hero. Although some details are slightly vague, people who can't stand some skills can infer how much Du Lin has learned from the Federation while he was a hero. interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he can appear at his wedding... Su Rui wants to be excited, knowing that there are many good sisters in her circle of friends who admire Doolin, and this one can really have a long face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin nodded. "If there is no accident, he will come early tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In fact, not only Du Lin will come over, but his sister will also come over, Mason commissioned someone to send a gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two discussed some details, and then left, the entire venue was completely closed after finishing the last thing, waiting quietly The arrival of the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning at 10 am, outside the ancient church on the outskirts of Nam Lindes, the wedding of Merlin and Surrey is about to begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Suri was surrounded by a group of little sisters. They all looked very bright and beautiful, and some luxury goods were everywhere on them. It can be seen that these girls are embarrassed to discuss the upcoming wedding, as well as the recent trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, the adventure of the old castle starring Kinsale is about to be released. She is going to attend the premiere at Irian, I got it. Five tickets, does anyone want to go?", a girl with a visor and a stylish and decent girl carrying a small Kun bag, holding a woman's slender cigarette holder in one hand, is showing off her recent harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kinsale is a female star who suddenly exploded in recent times. Several major producers are concentrating on this new debut actress. At the beginning of the first film, it has always been a big-cost production. In fact, the movie circle is simpler for people in the industry than people think. If you have money, you can have everything. Under the advocacy of public opinion, I paid for some titles such as new people, and soon Jinsell was accepted by the mainstream group. The appearance of Kinsale is still quite good, and the figure is good. Secondly, the acting has reached the passing line. It is no longer just to express emotions through blinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the most important thing is that you have money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a combination of factors, Kinsale’s popularity is a miracle, and it’s almost a household name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
