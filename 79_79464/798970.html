			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to the person of Kemma, Mennon’s eyes are slightly shrunk, and he has only feared two people in his life. The first one is Mr. Kesma, the fear of going deep into the bone marrow. At that time they were not called the Kadima Party, nor the Revolutionary Army. They had a horrible and romantic name called Blood Dawn. This is a small organization composed of many young people who can't stand the stupid aristocratic rule of the world. The purpose is to overthrow the rule of the nobility and usher in a new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This road is destined to be full of bumps and bloodshed, when Ms. Naes proposed the use of Scarlet Dawn as the name of the organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that special time, the Scarlet Dawn was defined as an anti-social terrorist organization that allowed aristocratic people to assassinate, incite, and uprising. At the end of the six-year period, at least 20 nobles with territories died in the hands of the bloody dawn. At that time they were still a group of young people who were full of blood. They still don’t know how to change the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the farmer’s door, Mr. Kesma has never shown any uncontrollable emotions. He always squints his face and does not reveal his inner feelings. He had no obvious expression when he was murdering, or when he saved the slaves who were abused by the nobility. He is like a beggar, working with precision, not being influenced by emotions, always being so rational. He once said a word - when we are not friends, we are enemies! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence makes many people feel fear, because Mr. Kesma’s friends are not many, and he did, let people pass death and blood Feel his attitude towards the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in Scarlet Dawn fears him and respects him. He is the banner of the whole organization, the leader, the core! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing that makes Mennon feel fear is the woman named Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the organization of Scarlet Dawn, it was often inexplicably hit hard, which also made people realize that people who might have aristocrats broke into the organization. . While Mr. Xmasma intends to eliminate the organization to find espionage, Walter and his family were arrested and publicly sentenced. Walter is the battalion commander of the training camp. Many members of the organization are his "apprentices". Everyone recommends to rescue his family. Mr. Kemas agreed to the request and planned a careful course of action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what makes people feel unprepared is that the woman named Anna, Walter's wife, is actually the secret of the empire into the organization. She killed their children under the age of two in front of Walter, killed his parents, and only wanted to get the real names of important members of the organization and family information from Walter's mouth. Walter watched his loved ones die in front of themselves but clenched their teeth without saying any words. His gums were cracked by huge pressure and blood flow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When angry members of the organization prepare to kill Anna and those empire agents, Mr. Xema finds the crowds around them, the most eye-catching There will be a small white flower in the place. He immediately realized that this was a huge trap. He immediately shot and killed Anna, rioting, and a bloody killing sang the last beautiful music of the bloody dawn! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer gave his arm a knife, wet his face with blood, and then lay down on the ground to escape. After the event, the bloody dawn was devastated by this ambush. Most of the important figures were killed in the "catastrophe", and this organization collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma found a place to live in seclusion with a few old men, and several other people have lived a peaceful life, but the doormen did not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tasted the taste of power, and how will he be willing to be calm and be a businessman? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to organize some people again and launched an uprising in the name of the "Revolutionary Army" in the name of the victory of the Great Patriotic War in an attempt to be in this empire. When the weakest, the empire was dried up. But he failed. Even if the empire is weak again, it is not something that thousands of people can shake. There is no doubt that it will fail. At the same time, the New Party took advantage of the opportunity of the revolutionary army to launch attacks from both the military and political circles. When the main force moved south to suppress the revolutionary army uprising, it implemented a premeditated coup plan, forcing the royal family to recognize the status of the new party and agreeing to establish it. Cabinet, a full replacement for the emperor to handle state affairs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that failure, the Mennon discovered that the original "rebellion" could still be played like this. After a lapse of years, he finally made a comeback and won three cities in one fell swoop. It became the party leader of the third largest party in the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his time, he is very convinced of this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the butler wrote to invite Mr. Kema to come to him is actually a superficial indication, a kind of self-willingness to admit it. Fear prompted him to do this. He was scared that Mr. Xema would come and even fear to see Mr. Xema, although he did not admit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Maxma refused our request. There was only one word in his reply - roll!" The butler snorted and raised his mouth and put it back. He wanted to laugh, but he still didn't laugh at the end, but his heart was still very happy. He is also a follower of Mr. Zema, convinced that they can bring change to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it’s not surprising that the butler is following the doorman. Without a leader who can be convinced and very strong, everyone’s ideas will Expressed in your own way, not in the will of one individual. This is doomed to the differences and conflicts. Some people think that the choice of the doormen is correct, and some people think that Shapk’s idea is correct. This is not surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer breathed a sigh of relief and showed a smile. "He is still the same, simple and powerful, although the word is not a good word, can be from the Sigma When the gentleman said it, he was very kind." The doorman was really relieved. Some people suggested that if you can't unify your opinions, please ask the "old leader" to make a decision for everyone. Let the group go to Mr. Xmas, and maybe Mr. Xema will come here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he can go, please, Mr. Xmasma will not come, because he does not like himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer knew this very well, and he didn’t like himself since he faked the old animals and sold them to Mr. Zema. He once thought that this was Mr. Zema's prejudice, but now he has to admit that prejudice can sometimes bring benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the butler leave the back doorman and go to the sofa to lie down, he likes to nest in this small place, which can provide him with more security . He hasn't slept in bed for a long time, and most of them are sleeping in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stumbled and sighed, hoping that his plan would not suffer from twists and turns! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Maxma, who was jealous of the leader of the farmer, has already arrived at Orodo, which also includes a hunchback old guy and two of him. Silly and strong son. It took only half a day, and they used the money Dulin gave to find the right house at the Alisa home and where she is now working. Similarly, after only half a day, they found someone monitoring Alisa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma sat in the room, he did not wear a canvas bib, but put on a clean formal suit with a round cap As the knife is engraved, there is a kind of imperceptible face filled with the traces of the years. He cocked his legs, carrying a silver ring on his index finger that he had never worn in the country. It was a woman named Alice who gave him, and the woman died in the catastrophe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His thumb swayed the silver ring, and there were some black and black inscriptions on the ring. It was written in the words of the Guar. The meaning was "When you fell in love with someone, that Man is your world." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Several people?", the two words spit out from his slightly opened lips, and everyone in the room was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., there are five people.", Martin, who was promoted to the captain of the seven-man team by Mr. Xema. Mr. Xmas lost a cigarette to Martin, and the whole person did not move except the arm. Directly interrogate, find out who they are and then clean up, try not to alarm other people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin said in the mouth that he left with his own people, The little old man with a hunchback touched his white beard and asked with a smile. "Leader, arrange some things for my children, and finally enter the city and let them see and see the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xe Ma snorted, "Take Alisa's usual route, and protect her at close range."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At this time, in addition to Mr. Kemma's arrival in Ordo, Dulin's people are also in Orodo, but his goal is not Alisa, but the young man called Dave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to Orodo, Dave’s attitude towards Alisa clearly showed some changes. He didn’t know how to face Alisa, and For yourself. If Alisa has forgotten and has not seen the man again, Dave is acceptable. But when I met the man in Irian, he found that Alisa had never forgotten the other side, which made him a little bit savory, and there was a sense of awkwardness that could not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not care about being a taker, I care that this disk is still green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day he was languid to finish the class, did not go home directly, but chose to go to the bar to get drunk. Orodo is also strictly implementing the Prohibition Order, but there are always some bars that have a liquor license and will sell some slightly higher alcohol. He selectively forgot the words of Alisa to explain him, so that he should try not to stay outside and go home as soon as possible after work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
