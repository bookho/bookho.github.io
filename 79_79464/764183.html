			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although very excited, Freina knew very well that if she could not do what Dulin needed, Du Lin would change someone to take over her job. . She may still be the heroine of the film, but she can no longer be qualified for the work of the producer. Perhaps it is easier for many actors to see a starring than to be a producer, because even if the movie cannot be sold after the release, the actor’s problem can only be ranked second and third. The first in the reprimand is the production. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she doesn’t think so, her ambition is not only that, she not only wants to be a household star, but also wants to be a qualified system. Filmmakers, and even in the future, have their own film and television companies in the film industry! So she cherished the opportunity that Du Lin gave her. She looked at Dove's body. "I have an idea. Do you know if Ms. Dove likes to perform?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?", Dove doesn't understand why Freena will bring the topic to her. She is just a maid, although sometimes she is temporarily acting as a female partner of Doolin. However, she never learned to perform, nor did she ever want to work in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Freina’s invitation to Du Lin, she understood that she thought that Dove’s relationship with her was more intimate than she had seen. Way to return Du Lin. This is a very smart girl, but she obviously misunderstood her relationship with Dove. However, this kind of thing, still have to ask the party's good, he looked at the Dove standing on one side and raised his chin. "How, want to be a female star?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duff shook his head. "I like to watch movies, but I never considered myself to be a shadow on the screen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders. "Hey, this little plan has failed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freina is not a bit embarrassed, she is very careful Obviously, there is nothing to be seen when it is seen. "Well, I will contact the formation crew as soon as possible, and try to shoot the movie in the first time. Your help to me, I will never forget it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin puts his hand in his hands. "Thank you for what you remember in your heart. It may not be possible to say it. I only have one request, that is, to reflect Yili as much as possible." Ann's style, but also can not lose the core of the film. Do this, as long as I am satisfied with the City Hall, not ? & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp there may be no second, third, you understand me "<br <br /> & nbsp />;Freina used a bit of a bit. She had already planned a list of all members and contacted them. It would take five days for everyone to expire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at his watch and stood up. "You do it quickly. I will go see you when I have time." You can continue to live here.", he said, he nodded. "I have nothing else to do with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freina When I got up and sent Du Lin to leave, I swung my fist hard. It belongs to her age. If nothing happens, it has already begun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin himself drove a two-seat sports car to the bank’s conference hall, where East Coast Entertainment’s equity auction will be held, and he kicked the meeting When the door was opened, the entire conference room was already smog. He walked over to sit next to Juan and sat down, took out the cigarette case and took out a cigarette and put it on his mouth. "I didn't expect you to come so early."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Huan smiled. "I don't like waiting for people, but I don't like people waiting. I don't like how others treat me. I don't do the same thing to treat other people." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at Juan with some surprise and couldn’t help but praise: "Do not let yourself be the person you hate, you have noble character!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hua haha ​​laughed, this is why he knows that this mistake may have something to do with Du Lin, but still likes to chat with Du Lin. He always can say the most appropriate words at the right time to make himself happy. This ability is really rare and terrifying. He thinks that Du Lin will definitely become a big man in the future, at least a big man who is better than him. Then it doesn't matter that even the evidence is not suspicion. As long as it shows sincerity, he believes that Du Lin's character can definitely be his good partner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premise is that there is no conflict of interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some people coming in and out. When the time arrived at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the door of the conference room was closed from the inside. The manager invited a professional auctioneer to come. The young man who is hosting the auction and he is a relative, he will receive a one percent commission as the host of the auction, and the bank will charge a commission of 6%. Everything is ok. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think should be the final transaction price today?" Juan asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin gave him a psychological price of about 800,000. The actual value of the East Coast Company is about 600,000 to 700,000. The reason why Du Lin has such a judgment is because the three plots in the first and second districts have a large appreciation space. If these plots do not consider the continued operation of the theater to build a home or any other building, the value generated is between three and four times the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the reason for not taking this price is that it is necessary to invest in rebuilding the building in the theater. It is already the limit to make a profit of around 200,000. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the beginning of the auction, the price continues to increase, saying that it is the entire auction, it is better to say that it is a three-party camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, Du Lin and Juan are counted as a camp. Some small and medium investors are a camp. The most surprising thing is that the little old man who proposed to buy it before is actually alone. One person is a camp. Du Lin whispered in the ear of Juan. "What is the old gentleman's head? I didn't take a long time to come to Irian. I don't know him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Juan is also a question mark, and Irians who have heads and faces have known him, but they have never seen this old man. Because of his face, he can only vaguely say that this old man may be an investor from a foreign country, perfunctory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Du Lin not know this old man, this old man is Ivan, half of Albert’s teacher. The reason why he was here was also arranged by Doolin. If another group of people could not copy the price, his plan would have failed completely. Dooling wants to minimize the liquidity of Juan. Once he starts to contact with the George family, Juan has less liquidity in his hands, and the lower the proportion of future cooperation, he may even be excluded. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to seize this rare opportunity, he must pledge some industries to the bank, or withdraw funds from certain areas, for example, he is in the eighth District investment in shopping malls. Whether he chooses to mortgage or choose to withdraw funds, the ultimate beneficiary is Du Lin undoubtedly. At that time, even if Juan knew that all of this was a ghost of Du Lin, he must continue to hold on to the scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t continue, the money he has invested in is equal to the flooding, and for these investments he has mortgaged those industries to individuals or banks. Unable to recover, all the business was ruined almost instantly. So he has to keep going, even if he knows how long he can hold on, he must hold on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As designed by the script, the price finally reached 800,000, and the winners were Du Lin and Juan. The two each had a total of 420,000 to acquire the entire equity of East Coast Entertainment. It’s funny. Du Lin bought the company that belonged to them with Juan and other people’s money. They also thanked Du Lin for spending so much money to buy East Coast Entertainment Company and let them return a little. this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witnesses signed the final agreement under the witness of everyone, and immediately sent people to the General Chamber of Commerce, the Irian branch to register the replacement of the shareholder. From this moment on, the sixteen theaters owned by East Coast Entertainment Company belong to Juan and Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, we will implement the second step in our plan." After the meeting, Du Lin sat in Juan's car and talked about it. Regarding the work of intercepting the work before the George family completed the layout, "I have two proposals for this part."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You say, let me refer. Juan, he nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first proposal, we each set up a company, and then build a theater around the enclosure, the final negotiation is also divided into three parties. The second It is proposed that we continue to inject capital into East Coast Entertainment Company, re-allocate the shares according to the amount of capital injection, and finally negotiate with the George family separately. Both methods have their own advantages and each have their own shortcomings. As for how to choose, I I want to hear your opinion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Du Lin said, Juan fell into meditation, as Du Lin said, both methods have It's a bit of its own, but it also has obvious drawbacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first method is financially independent, and neither party can pull the opponent's hind legs, regardless of the speed of either party. But the downside is that the two sides are not a whole. They may not be able to guarantee that everyone will use the greatest strength to develop the number of theaters. In the process of negotiation, it is very likely that they will be divided by the George family. In the end, neither side can get what they want. The second method compensates for the shortcomings of the first method, but there are also obvious problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Juan has more capital injections, then Juan will become a major shareholder, but if Doolin is investing more? Although Juan investigated Du Lin, he did not know how much liquidity Du Lin had. From his series of large-scale operations and the provision and planning of the plan, Juan felt that Du Lin had absolutely large sums of money in his hands. Once Doolin has invested more than him, it means that Du Lin will dominate in future cooperation, which is exactly what Juan wants to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
