			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivienne quickly left the Tenel Police Department, she did not like this place, there was a "slow" thing everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that there is something here that makes her feel sick, and no one can dare to make indecent moves to her, so-called for her. "Underflow" can be seen as a collection of negative descriptions that are not influential, vulgar, ugly, dirty, etc. She is like a spotless sacred silverware, clean and holy, but it is full of filth and annoying things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Mrs. Vivian’s car is gone, Prando’s stunned squat in the chair, has arrived at work, a minute ago he Also, Xiaoqu is going to change into a casual dress and go to the bar to relax. But after a minute, he could only avoid swearing out of his mouth as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, the city of Tener is very small, but there are definitely no more than three or five people, or thirty or fifty people in a small city. This is a city, not a kindergarten. The ghost knows what the three portraits on the table are called and where they live. And that slightly twisted lines... Prando can't find adjectives anymore, he thinks that if someone can grow into this ghost, then they must all be the sons of the devil, their mother is the devil, because people are It is absolutely impossible to grow into this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone else told him, he still had a chance to perfuse the past. After all, he is a director. There are a lot of things. It is not normal to transfer the commission to the men. ? When the other party finds it again, and then pushes a small police officer who looks at his disappointment to the black pot, things are almost solved. Everyone is a smart person. He shows that he can do nothing in this way. Forcing him, that is to deliberately find fault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking for a police chief? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh...! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mrs. Vivian is not the same, neither her husband nor her own power and energy, nor is he a regional police chief in Prando. Perfunctory. He can guarantee that if he can't find these three people in the short term, he will definitely have big trouble! Trouble with this thing, everyone doesn't like it, because trouble means loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a possibility of losing money, it is possible to lose the police cap, and it is also possible to lose something else important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Prando called two police officers to frown together, Xiuen, who just woke up, yawned from the second floor, he While walking, licking the eyes that are wet because of yawning, and also slightly dry eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sleep is really comfortable, he is still intoxicated in the perfect sleep before, falling asleep in the sun is definitely a pleasure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was about to leave the police station, he was attracted by the lights behind him. He hesitated for about 0.5 seconds. His original plan was to find a bar, and then find a more open girl. After playing all night, he came back to sleep late. After 0:5, I didn't know whether it was a conscience discovery, or because of curiosity, he went to the office of the police chief who should have closed early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment he opened the door, he smacked his mouth, and Prando showed two police officers who were familiar in their forties but could not name them. Taking advantage of the three portraits that he stood on the desk, the eyes of the three people were all red, and there was a pile of cigarette butts on the ground, still smoking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? Master's work?", his curiosity is stronger, can't help but sound, walked over, went to three people and portraits Between, after careful reading, stretched out the little finger and rubbed the ear with narrow and slender nails. "You invited a new artist? If I were you, I would let him go immediately, if not I know these three. Oh, I don’t even know that this thing is a person!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Xiuen only feels that he seems to speak at an instant at least two inches He slammed Prando's hands tightly against his collar. "Let me down, there is something we can communicate with. I just stole a few bottles of wine, can't you do this to me?!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando glanced, subconsciously looking at the wine cabinet. His wine cabinet is shaped like an x-shaped fence made of wood and holds a total of thirty-two bottles of wine. Before Xiu En came, he remembered that every room in his wine cabinet had a good wine that someone had sent him, but now... he counted and there were eleven bottles left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why didn't you find it before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This damn guy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
