			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss, I have already checked, Mr. Doolin spent some time in the city of Tener, and settled in Irian more than half a year ago..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Nasha heard the word "Ternell", she couldn’t forget what she had encountered at Turner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John had three marriages before and after, and each marriage brought him a child. He has three children, two boys and one girl. Probably because of the unsatisfactory marriage, the two children in front of him had a bad relationship with him. When he was an adult, he took the initiative to leave home. When he was studying, he became a couple and married with the second generation of steel tycoon. Going home to see John, the contact is quite rare, and the relationship between the father and the daughter is very poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the eldest son, Nasha’s father, left the family after John’s first marriage ended, when he was only sixteen. He always thought that John had abandoned his mother because he was greedy for a young girl. This was a betrayal of the family, so he left home without hesitation and went out alone. He goes to school while doing temporary work, and his academic performance is very good. He can get a full scholarship every year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of studying, I also met my favorite woman, and married Nasha. After the marriage, Nasha’s father became a teacher and taught in a school she had studied. If he had no accidents in his life, he should change after John’s death. As the eldest son of John, he will inevitably inherit a large amount of his property, as well as industry and power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is here. John’s third marriage is for a very young actress. This young woman likes to have fun, even during pregnancy, she often plays in the middle of the night or even in the morning. She also has a smoking hobby and often drinks. The age gap and John's growing age made him not have the energy to restrain his third wife, which led to the frailty of the child she gave birth. This problem is not a big problem for a big family like the George family. They have enough money and resources to make up for the innate lack of children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like Juan’s son Cullen thinks that some of the money in Juan’s pocket is his own, and John’s brothers and sisters also believe that the wealth of the George family has them. Half of it. In particular, Arthur, the youngest child around John, has developed the same temperament as most wealthy families. After eating and drinking, he is not willing to do anything. Their desire to master family wealth and power is even higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such circumstances, John took the initiative to find Nasha's father, hoping that he would be able to return to the family to share part of his work, but also to shock those family members who have unrealistic fantasies. The teacher who has never relied on the family and has serious contradictions with his father has his own stubbornness. He refused John’s request and insisted that he had nothing to do with the George family. He even changed his family name to his mother. The last name to sever the connection between each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid Nasha's harassment and influence, he sent Nasha to his mother's hometown of Orodor, to avoid John. Nasha, who does not know the truth, does not know that she is one of the heirs of a billionaire family. She thinks she is just a child of an ordinary teacher. One more thing happened during this period. Nasha’s mother fell for the second time in five months of pregnancy. The situation was very serious and she had symptoms of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Nasha’s father didn’t have enough money in his pocket to get his wife to receive the best treatment, so he had to pick up the phone and contacted the most The person who arrived, John. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a connection between the two and the link was maintained. It may be that I feel the growing oldness and sorrow of my father. The hatred of ten or twenty years has also been resolved unconsciously. He finally accepted his father's request and returned to the George family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a dog-blooded script. Arthur, who grew up in the touts of the uncles all day, faced the brother who suddenly came in. Shows full hostility. His uncle told us that if he could not kick his brother out, then the property he could get in the future would be split in half to his brother. Arthur, who has never done anything right, began to work hard, and with the help of some uncles and uncles, he began a struggle with Nasha’s father to “have the courage to fight”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole family is filled with smoke, and at this time, Nasha returned to the family... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never imagined that Nasha, who has such a status, almost collapsed. She feels that her whole life is a scam, everyone is She is deceiving her by hurting her, and she is more autistic and indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first direct family member of the third generation, Nasha received far more attention than his father’s attention, and even attracted a lot to her father. Firepower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until John sent her to Irian, in addition to letting her out of the heart, it was also to avoid being targeted by family members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she didn’t think that she left the whirlpool center and actually met the word that reminded her of the most painful things in life – Tyne! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a feeling that Nasha has a feeling that Doolin must have something to do with his own experience. She knew very well that she had never seen Du Lin, and it was even more impossible to talk to him, but the familiar voice lingered in her ear for a long time, as if...had heard his voice somewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will attend the food festival tomorrow, you will help me prepare.", Nasha is a brave girl, otherwise it is impossible to go to Oro alone. More strange places to go to school, since she is confused, then to solve this confusion. And as one of the main parties to the original, she thought that there were too many unreasonable things in it, she wanted to know the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bit strange that Nasha’s request to participate in the food festival suddenly, she said this before, the City Hall and Alexander have invited Sha, she was rejected by her one by one. But now suddenly I want to go, is there anything wrong with this? Chris thought about the possibility behind Nasa's attitude change, and she agreed to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food festival has played a certain role after a period of publicity. From the sudden increase in the number of passengers in these days, it is necessary to continue this activity. of. The City Hall is very satisfied. If the food festival is finally closed, the word-of-mouth effect of these tourists will become the focus of publicity, attracting more tourists to Ilyan. Alexander was also very satisfied. As a organizer of the food festival, he also received enough attention, which created a good condition for him to expand the hotel industry from the Ilyan region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the flags are fluttering in the air, and the colorful balloons are flying in the sky. The cruise ship that the port is constantly stopping will leave the full load of tourists and immediately leave. The location allows the cruise ship that has been waiting for the unloading of tourists to be docked offshore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin holds a small bowl in his hand, and the bowl contains something weird. These things are oval, orange, and have small finger sizes. The extremely thin outer wall can be seen inside a small fish that has been formed and is constantly swimming. This is a deep-sea fish caviar. It doesn't require any sauce to make people intoxicated. When you bite the outer wall, the extremely delicious juice immediately blasts, and you can feel something on the tip of your tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of fish requires five dollars an ounce, although the taste is not something that everyone can consume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are too many people!", Du Lin sighed, it was only a moment of enthusiasm for Alexander, but with the help and promotion of the City Hall, now The effect has exceeded the limit that Alexander can imagine. Obviously, the mainstream newspaper will definitely report the grand occasion of the Irian Food Festival tomorrow, which is one of the achievements of the City Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freina, who walked around Doolin, nodded. She pressed her hand on the pale blue sunhat, and the green gauze was blown away by the sea breeze. , revealing the white feet. The film crew did not have a holiday, and the location was on the beach. This is what Du Lin promised to be in the big, and Philip paid 50,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes lit up, pointing to the area surrounded by people in the distance, "Hey, it’s a big stomach king game!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked in the direction she was pointing, and at first glance she saw a huge belly and the owner of Alexander, the giant belly. The guy’s laughing mouth couldn’t be closed, standing on the stage and hosting the first game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone can participate in the Big Stomach competition, without any cost, the game is a kind of sausage made from fish, from the cost control point of view Toys are much cheaper than bread. After the long table, there are already ten contestants who are from all over the Empire. They may feel that they are more likely to eat, so try to challenge the "title" of the big stomach king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to complete the event, Alexander is also racking his brains. He has opened a total of nine activities, in addition to the big stomach king game. There are games like buckets and belly. The titled player can have 15 days of free check-in at the hotel, which can be taken apart or continuously, and can be accommodated at any time of the year. More importantly, each champion has a bonus of 30,000 yuan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is anything you don’t need to work hard, just eat something delicious, and if you drink something good, you can make a lot of money, then these are the games. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Want to try?", Du Lin asked casually, he heard two things in his dreams, not knowing the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
