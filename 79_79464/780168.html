			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke came to Irian without thinking about investing here or working with others. He came to find his face, but he didn't come to pay for it. Unfortunately, the last face was not found, and the money was thrown away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be a bit of a problem, but it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, if you transfer your financial adviser and lawyer from the west, God knows how long it will take, did not listen to Du Lin, if there is no problem If you want to sign an agreement the day after tomorrow, the day after tomorrow! No time, Luke directly touched the attention of his friend Garfield. This old friend has his own financial consultant and legal counsel. It should not be a problem to borrow it. It is really not good to give them money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a nouveau riche, if the three words do not pull out a "money" word, the extent of the outbreak is not enough. Luke also knew that he was a good luck speculator, a lucky one who was overwhelmed by God. He never denied that he was a nouveau riche, he is rich! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Garfield, the boss, his two employees also gave face, when Luke detailed the results of his discussions with Du Lin, The legal counsel raised a small question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can understand that Du Lin gave up Luke’s direct investment in what he is now, and it involves some commercial problem. To give an example, for example, the equity owner of the second-ranking transportation company "Chopbo Transportation Company" is not a cut-wave, but another person, but people think that Chobo is the boss. In the current position of the lawyer, he believes that Du Lin's work is in line with a sincere partner. This is a good way to avoid people's inherent belief that the owner of the Eastern Star must be Doolin's misunderstanding, thus ignoring the facts. There is also a Luke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Du Lin can think of avoiding this problem, why choose Luke to register a company himself, instead of registering with two people? Didn't he know that once Luke registered the company, he would use his own company to buy shares, even if Luke's shareholding distribution did not have him, would people think that this company is Luke? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the company did a good job, the first thing people think of is Luke, not his Du Lin. Lawyers think that they are very transparent to these capitalists. They have only three purposes for any behavior, either money, or name, or power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke stunned for this problem, his expression became serious, his knowledge was not very high, and he admired these knowledgeable people, so he really took the lawyer's doubts seriously. He thought about it and asked: "So is this good or bad for me? Is there any trap in it that will drain my investment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer is too familiar with this situation. After all, he is doing this. Garfield told him that Luke’s education is not high. Some things need to be explained more, and he has to explain it clearly, so he is also very serious. The analysis gave Luke, "Mr. Luke, let's just say that the company you registered does not change its shareholding in the future. When people go to the company, your name will always be the first, and You will also be marked as the founder of this company. As for the equity share, it is on another page."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are many entrepreneurs with good ideas because It’s very unpleasant to fight for the name of the first person, and even if the company is not established, they will set up the company separately. So I think this is a very strange thing. Mr. Doolin gave up and can say that it is very important for a company. Something. And your Words are like branding and will be firmly engraved on this company. Regardless of whether you have equity in this company in the future, you will always be the founder of this company, and your name on the non-equity share page. It’s all first.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke is a little surprised, he doesn’t believe that Du Lin will be so good, people who are thinking are always feeling that others’ hearts are also dirty. Dirty, "Is there any trap here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer shook his head. "This is just a matter of honor and does not have any practical meaning, just like When people talk about the Irian landmark building, they think of Mr. Alexander. Even if Alexander sells the hotel in the future, many people will think of Mr. Alexander and even ignore the fact of ownership transfer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard that Luke basically understood, he rewrote the complicated concept on the one side in a way that he could understand. "This is equivalent to buying a horse with Doolin, in order to let others know this. Who is the horse, so I want to be in the horse ass Hot a mark. Du Lin now gave up this power, then I burned the mark that belongs to me on the horse's buttocks. Even if I gave this horse to Doolin, the first time someone saw the horse Will it be my horse, does this mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer smiled and clicked, Luke waved his hand. "There is no problem, When I signed the agreement the day after tomorrow, I hope that you can go with me. Do you have time on that day?" The lawyer nodded. For him, it doesn't matter who he is serving. Anyway, he charges according to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon a message was circulated in the high society of Irian, and the speed of the rumor spread was amazing. It is said that Luke, a mining tycoon from the west, officially wants to cooperate with Doolin. The two partners to establish a new company and accelerate the promotion of the south. The establishment of the cinema. The news did not know where it came from. Juan knew the first time to actively verify and got a positive reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s better than a few days, the mood is getting worse! He thought he was winning the game. Didn't he think that Du Lin actually found another foreign aid? It’s like a boxing match. Juan stood up uneasy, not to mention reading at this time, that is, he could not sit still in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Dulin had expected, when the previous two million-dollars were thrown in, he did not hurt Juan’s bones. He did not feel any burden. But after investing more than three million and mortgaged many industries to the bank, he felt that there was no way out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far away, even if he wants to let go now, he will buy back his own industry with more money, but the other five or six million will equal Hit the water. When Du Lin put forward this idea, he told him that it would not be impossible to build a movie theater in the best place in the best city, but the speed is definitely too late. And Du Lin proposed to implement this set of plans in some cities, but other small cities can buy a bit of land, mainly quantitative issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The George family will look at the resources in their hands, but who can really see the specifics of each cinema? And the so-called investigation of this kind of thing is still their own initiative, they can take them to the model city to see those model cinemas. Choose a few representative to let the George family inspect, and after the successful cooperation, the rest will be slowly built. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the idea put forward by Du Lin, Juan saw the possibility of working with the George family, otherwise there were twenty or thirty cinemas in his hands. Why do people work with you to form an industry trust? I am afraid I will waste time even if I look at it more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides a few cinemas, others are built in relatively cheap and remote places, not to mention the original price to sell, even if there is no interest in discounts, it is difficult to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of five or six million in one breath is definitely hurtful. The more troublesome thing is that the money in the eighth district has also been pumped out and all of them have been invested. At this time, the call will stop and his loss will be an astronomical number. This includes the cash that he has lost, and he holds a large amount of non-performing assets that can't bring in profits, and the income that can be expected in the future. It takes at least ten years for him to get rid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
