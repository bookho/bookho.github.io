			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin told the Buddha to do it, and Coster laughed, laughing a little. He slowly raised his head, and he had already climbed some blood on his eyes. He looked at Du Lin with a slight squint on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you!" This is the first sentence of Coster. "You are the mayor of Otis, a famous new politician, in the newspaper. Also said that you are a 'minority'. I have also heard about your deeds on the East Coast. It is quite scary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin pick The brow turned and looked at him, slightly decapitated, let him continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if he broke the can, or for other reasons, his words don’t seem to be asking for mercy. “Do you want to catch my family? Do you "Is there no family?", his tone looked very casual and very contemptuous, but he was a threat. "I believe that you also have family, parents, brothers and sisters. You can catch my family, don't others Will you catch your family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Doolin, how do you treat me today, how will someone treat you tomorrow!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin couldn’t help but scream and his body shook a bit. He stepped forward to Coster, and one hand broke into the pocket of his clothes, just one step away from him. When he was away, he suddenly broke his hand into his pocket and put it on his back. Then he punched him on the gang of Coster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the slamming sleeves, the windy lake that hangs up when it hangs quickly is a muffled sound, and Coster’s head squats to one side, and the blood scatters instantly. One place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin released his hand and threw the blood-stained key to the Buddha. He pulled out the white handcuffs in his jacket pocket and wiped the blood on his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kinah pulled back from the hair behind his head, and asked Coster to raise his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His scorpion to the corner of his mouth was torn apart by a keyhole, and the lower half of the skin and flesh were pulled down, revealing the teeth and gums covered with blood. . His eyes were a little dim, but he still looked at Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of character Du Lin has not seen it. It is the same as that of Gotall. It is the same poison, but in the end he did not get a good end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While rubbing the blood on the back of his hand, Du Lin glanced at him. "The difference is that when someone has this idea, I will first You kill him in one step. And you, after only the idea that has been implemented, you will only be verbally tough. Mr. Coster, no matter how hard you behave or refuse to cooperate, it doesn’t matter to me. You It’s just a fish in the pond, you are not a pond, you are one more, one less one, you have nothing to do with the big picture.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the white handcuffs on the Cowes On the face, "Guess, will the person behind you be a full-scale war with me because of a small person like you?", his hand clenched the jaw of Kooster's nakedness and pulled it hard. A soothing snoring, Coster’s chin was dislocated by Du Lin’s. “Oh, I almost forgot, you can’t talk. Sometimes shutting up is more precious than thinking without thinking.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, Mr. Goodnight, you will be able to see your family tomorrow, the last side of each other!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Coster is struggling, but what is the use? When he tried to use the means of threats to check and balance Du Lin, Du Lin’s mentality had changed, no longer curious, but killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion must kill all those who dare to offend their majesty, and only then will they be able to guarantee their supremacy in the hunting area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a dog growls toward a lion, it can only be a lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the forage warehouse, Du Lin and Dufoy got on the bus. As he finished his clothes, he said, "Let Savi come over, almost one year soon." Now, it’s time to take a look at the results of their training.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Would you want to go to war?”, both on the driver’s vehicle while passing through the inside of the car. The mirror glanced at him. "Who is the other party? To what extent will the war be achieved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sorts out the clothes and looks out the window like the city that illuminates the sky Lantern, chuckled and said: "A very powerful person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, if Coster’s home is an ordinary force, he would not hesitate to sell the other party in exchange for his own safety. His ability to stare at Du Lin's many titles is still not so cooperative, indicating that he has a kind of emboldened. This kind of qi is derived from his home. He believes that after he disappears for a few days, he will find out that someone will come to negotiate with Doolin, and then he will be safe. He was convinced that Doolin was the politician and gang leader he had seen, but he ignored the most important point - he had not dealt with Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who have dealt with Doolin know that he is a very good speaker and a very difficult person to talk to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially when a person violates his interests, he will never compromise, or even give up part of the benefits, he must fight with the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people might think this is a very stupid act, all for money, for power, what can't be talked about? Those who say such words are definitely the kind of people who have no worries when they are young, and at least the middle class. In their worldview and values, there is nothing in this world that cannot be resolved through communication and negotiation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that there are not only, but also many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom to offend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dignity that cannot be trampled! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insulting personality! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps in their eyes those who make a murder case for one or two swear words are ridiculous, but at the bottom of society, this is not a ridiculous thing, this is Serious things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence along the way, all Buddha did not speak, he was a little inexplicable in his heart. Doolin is rarely a bit erratic or dysfunctional as it is today. This shows that the person or organization that makes the counterfeit currency is very powerful, so he will be somewhat rude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Zhongdu Buddha sent Du Lin to his home, he returned to his room and called Savi to let them pack things tomorrow, to Otis City is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Du Lin returned to normal, he actually considered it for a while at night, and finally decided that if the other party did not pay any price, then he built This golden cave will become a gold cave for others. Today is a problem with tokens. It may involve the shares of the casino tomorrow. In the end, maybe all his game rules will be trampled on. Only by letting people know his determination can they be vigilant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you dare to reach out, you will always die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next afternoon, Mr. Coster’s family from Nano Lindes has arrived, adding up to a dozen people, and some relatives are still on weekdays. There is no connection in it. These dozens of people are people around him, close people, people who often contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They initially thought that Coster really invited them to play together in the city of Otis, so there was no one who drove the Audis reception car to pick them up. question. Everyone knows that Coster is a jerk. He likes to taste fresh everywhere. If something has fun, he will definitely check it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Otis is right next to it, he can’t possibly stay with such a big thing, maybe he found it really fun, and it’s rare to be generous once. These people also got on the bus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This car is not so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car did not stop at any reception station in the city of Otis, but directly into the warehouse area behind the ranch, parked outside a forage room. When a man with a gun in his hand let them get off, they realized that they might have made a stupid mistake. How can you invite them to come here to enjoy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s a bit late to wake up at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the straw room, Coster saw his relatives, wife, children, cousins ​​and uncles and wives. These people were frightened and stood up, and the people around them gave them too much pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cester’s eyes were filled with desperate colors. He thought that Du Lin would come back and give him a last chance. He will tell Du Lin everything he knows in exchange for a chance. Now he regrets very much, because Du Lin, this guy, did not follow the rules, so that he could not keep up with Du Lin's rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He yelled at his head, and Kea knew that he wanted to talk, but Doolin did not tell him to let him speak again. He didn't press Koester's chin off his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gentlemen, ladies, I am very sorry to bring you to this less beautiful environment. Because Mr. Coster used to sell on Mr. Doolin’s site. The fake and inferior tokens produced in private have seriously damaged the rights and interests of Mr. Du Lin and the general citizens of Otis. Therefore, Mr. Coster was invited by Mr. Doolin, hoping that he can explain clearly."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
