			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was Mr. Doolin!", Sandra smiled and nodded, and sat back again. "Since Mr. Doolin wants, I won't argue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this sentence is Sandra's compliment on Du Lin's face. In fact, it can be said that it is a bit sinister. Du Lin took Mr. Andorra's mining area before and sent Mr. Andorra back to the embrace of God, so that many mine owners of the West Mine have a great opinion on him and have already had a prejudice. At this time, if Sandra shows the hegemony of the agent of the Orvili Group, it may be able to save some "images" for Dooling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same enemy is always the weakest one to distinguish the most intuitive things of the companion, Sandra blood washed six mines to say that no one hates this woman obviously not Possibly, everyone does not like this kind of person who is unscrupulous for the sake of profit. If she competes with Du Lin, Du Lin will become a little weaker in the eyes of these people. After all, Du Lin has only washed a mining area, and has not shown more desire for aggression until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can Sandra's active avoidance instead set off an illusion that she was afraid of Doolin, and continued to expand Doolin's "evil" and hide herself. It is like she is not guilty of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even she is offended by Dooling, how many people here can offend Du Lin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fedley coughed a little, wanted to say something, explain the truth of the matter, after all, Andorra is wrong, Du Lin is just self-defense Counterattack. He has also been operating in the west for some years. He has mastered two very valuable gold mines and gemstone mines, and he has certain power and strength. His explanation, even if people don't believe it, will shake their existing ideas. But Du Lin quietly held his leg and let him swallow the words he was ready to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat with a blank expression. He knew that Federley was kind, but sometimes good intentions might not be able to change back to a good situation. When he first arrived in the west a month ago, the people here looked down on him from top to bottom. Only when the people here noticed his evil began to fear and hate him, if the things between him and Andorra really After the explanation is clear, people may still resist him and hate him like this, and there will be no big difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepted? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s impossible, although the west is big, there are many resources, there are more people who can live here, and people living here on the top of the tower welcome the world. Fertilizers everywhere moisten the soil in the west, but they do not welcome those strong people to divide their living space. Anyway, it doesn't appeal to people. Why not let others be more afraid of themselves? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra’s performance made this auction come to an end, and Doolin took the mining rights of the copper mine for three million. He only needs to register, and after the relevant mining procedures, he can be exploited on a large scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auction was caused by the appearance of Doolin, and there were not many participants in the cold meal after the meeting. The main members of the West Mine were almost gone, they had to find a The place to open a small meeting, only the self-contained forces represent here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra has been paying attention to Dooling, just as she is preparing to say hello to Du Lin, Henry first passes her by, stretching Going to Dulin. This gesture is actually very...hemily, a bit shameful, but neither Henry himself, Sandra nor Clylandf feel that Henry is too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not pure Westerners, they are representatives of major group companies and even large consortia, and they are more aware of what is happening elsewhere in this empire. Doolin on the east coast, this is the prefix that people add to distinguish between Du Lin and other people called Du Lin, along with a series of legendary deeds. In the eyes of these people, Doolin has three of the most valuable things. The first is his perfect smuggling channel maintained in cooperation with the Navy on the East Coast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the city of Otis, the most popular cash cow in the empire he built. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and most powerful force is the fellowship he has in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they won’t treat Doolin as a humble little person, who have used to living in shopping malls and more, have already treated Doolin People with the same status, even those who are better than themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least he is the leader of an interest group, and the Sandra tributary is only working for interest groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been listening to Elena to mention you..." Henry laughed very sunnyly. According to his personal information, he is 36 years old this year, but his hair is somewhat bald like a fifty-six-year-old man. However, this does not hinder his noble temperament and a little smile that does not understand the cheerful smile to infect others. "I am very fortunate to be able to see you here. I heard that you came to the west and want to invite you to go there. Turn, Elena's craftsmanship is good, you will like her meals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very direct invitation, because the family feast is in the Western world. The meaning far exceeds the general social etiquette, can bring the feast into a deeper meaning, and at some point can even be regarded as a further temptation, such as alliances. Only companions who trust each other and have extraordinary values ​​and meanings will be invited to the feast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a moment and then remembered that this Elena should be Mark’s sister, Nasha’s aunt, who nodded quietly. I reached out and held it tightly with Henry. "Me too, after we have dealt with the things in my hands these days, will we have a time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Anytime, anywhere!", Henry shook his arm, then smiled and looked at Sandra, who had already walked to the side. He turned back and said to Du Lin: "I still have something, leave one step, I will let the secretary take me. The phone is for you.", after talking about his simple farewell to Sandra, he once again looked at Doolin and turned and left quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s eyes stayed on Henry’s back for a moment before turning back to the beautiful woman in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Du Lin has seen many beautiful women, what kind of beautiful women are there, especially in the world of dreams, he almost read all kinds of worlds. woman. Here, there have always been beautiful women around him, whether it is a Dove who has cultivated a certain temperament, or a beauty like Freina, he has seen a lot, but it is rare to see a woman like Sandra. Her temperament is very special, her eyes are very smart, she does not need to let the facial muscles adjust according to their own ideas, just the change of the eyes can let people know what kind of expression will appear on her face in the next second. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very weird woman. When you look at her, she thinks she will laugh. The next second she really laughs and laughs comfortably. It is also amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like she is looking at Du Lin now, her eyes are not scarred, the cold and bloody behind the nickname, but rather gentle, just like the moonlight The stream flows like a stream, and people can feel good when they are unconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just pushed off Claref's invitation, you have to ask me for dinner." She laughed a few times and looked at Du Lin, who had no change in expression. "You made me lose a feat, it shouldn't be Is compensation for me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Know, Sandra, Sandra Di Plessi, agent of the current West of Orvili Metal Group , I am fully responsible for all the things of the group company in the west! I am very glad to meet you, Mr. Doolin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s eyes moved from her face to her On the hand, then she reached out and shook her hand. The woman's hand looked very soft, but actually gave Du Lin a very "hard" feeling. The two men's hands were loosened and they were released. "Du Lin, you know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the founder of the miracle, the entire empire is Discuss the miracles you and you created, and if you can, tell me how you thought of turning a ruin in a Gobi desert into a bustling metropolis? I am very curious!", at this time, Sandra If you only look at your eyes, it is like a little girl who saw his idol when he was sixteen or seven years old. His eyes were full of inquiry and curiosity, and there was a trace of worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was very surprised when he was so observant, and he was able to read so many complicated information from a person’s eyes. Zhen Zhen came back to God. "This title sounds awkward. As for how I did it... of course, it was forced out." He said, laughing, and his keen perception made him aware that someone has been Staring at himself, when he looked in the direction of the gaze, Clifford, who was eating in the distance, took his gaze and looked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s gaze also spurred Sandra’s turn. When she turned around, she whispered, “Mr. Clivef is in the west. There are not many friends, and Mr. Andorra is one of his few friends." She seems to be explaining the "interaction" between Doolin and Clilan, and actually tells Du Lin a potential message. Clilan is his enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy's friend is also the enemy. The concept applies to any world, in any environment, and here is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin knows that this woman is provoking the relationship between herself and Clyland, who has only seen one side, but has to deny that this provocation is effective, at least Doolin remembered Cleinf as a person, and he will pay attention to him for a long time in the future and whether his actions will cause trouble to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
