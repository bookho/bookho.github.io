			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the two thousand dollars on the desk of the branch secretary’s office, neither Totti nor the parents of the deceased did not take it, nor did they say a word. The director of the branch office also looked ugly in the chair. Fowlers father and son were really too much. It was too much to kill an innocent pedestrian who was only willing to pay two thousand dollars. The police are also people, the bureau chief is also a person, they are not considered high-ranking figures, barely can only be regarded as the middle-level elite, so they have the same indignation, and hatred and contradictions between classes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Totto is seldom smoked, but at this time he is holding a pipe made of simple wood, and after taking two, he spits out thick smoke. After the smoke, the blood-stained eyes flashed a trace of something that others had not found. He slowly stood up and everyone's eyes focused on him. He looked at the parents of the deceased and only said three words - follow me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is blocking them, and no one is following them. They don’t know what Totti will do to solve this problem, but they want Totti’s approach. it works. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just got up from the bed, and the teacher he invited was here yesterday. Not only are Savi, they are learning, but he is also following the serious study. Cultural classes, combat classes, and a variety of bizarre courses made him exhausted, but he felt that learning these things would be useful, and even if he had no chance to use it, he could improve his literacy and strengthen his physical fitness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having eaten a little Duff prepared for breakfast, this is the first time in more than half a year that Doolin did not go to have coffee and snacks. The arm, today, apart from the teacher of the culture class, they have a rest day. After eating breakfast, I plunged into the swimming pool and stretched my body to swim back and forth in the sparkling swimming pool. When he was ready to go ashore, he saw the Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo is also quietly returning to the manor yesterday, Eric should now wrestle with sharks about ten nautical miles from the shoreline if he can Hold on for three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of Buddha in the pool means that there is something that needs Du Lin to decide, he sinks into the water, then squats like a swordfish Out of the water. Pressing both hands on the edge of the pool has already come ashore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doff gave the bath towel to him. He wiped the waterdrops on his head with a bath towel and walked toward the interior of the manor with Dufo. Eric is back?", Fondton couldn't help but laugh, Du Lin smiled. Everyone knows that Eric has become a food for marine plankton through the shark's stomach. He can't come back. . This is just a little joke, "What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Totti came to the door with a couple to see, they are now in the eccentric hall, do you still see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Totto? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s footsteps, thought for a few seconds before I remembered the old Guart, he nodded immediately. “Of course I want to see them, let them take a break, I Change your clothes and go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a big difference between seeing guests in the office and seeing guests in the lobby. The lobby will not talk about being too serious or important. The topic of privacy is not formal enough. Only the study and the partial hall were enough formal, and Totti was not qualified to enter Du Lin’s study, but the partial hall was just right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Doolin, who changed his clothes, pushed the door of the hall, the Totti and the couple sitting on the sofa stood up. Du Lin smiled and raised his hand and walked to the main seat and sat down. He tilted his leg and took out a cigarette from the cigarette case, and he immediately set fire to him. After taking a sip of smoke and spitting it out, Du Lin asked: "Mr. Totti, I haven't seen it for a while, don't know if there is anything I need to help you to go to the door today?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Totto slammed his head hard. His expression was very serious and very serious. "Yes, Mr. Doolin, I am asking for you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin made a gesture to say, Totti immediately said the original taste of the bar, and said nothing, including their attitude, including the Fowlers father and son Attitude and tone are all imitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell the truth is very sympathetic to the couple’s encounter with Du Lin, but it is only sympathy. The Guarts are very prolific. In Irian, most Guar families have at least two children, and some have three or five children. The death of a child is indeed very distressing, but it is not necessarily true that it is really painful to live. So many children, who can guarantee that every child is the favorite of their parents? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One less will only be a little sad, and it will be fine in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he wouldn’t say it, first asked a question, is this couple a Guar? If it is, he will take a little control. If not, then he can only help. After all, the hatred and hostility between races have never disappeared. He does not need to use his power for the cancellation of a population of other races. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are, they are the descendants of the great first king, we are the guar race!", the old Totti's voice is powerful, and also hammered his chest, "I can guarantee this if you find them Not a gult, you can dispose of me at will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat on the sofa for a moment, his eyes were always in Totti and the pair The couple kept squinting back and forth. During this time, he was busy pulling Juan down and handling the East Coast Entertainment Company, slowing down the development of the fellowship, perhaps this is a very suitable opportunity! The finger of one hand pressed against the arm of the sofa, his fingers gently pinched his earlobe, his body leaned back slightly, and looked up at the couple with his head up. "What do you want us to do? It is to get more. Money? Still need me to do something else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Totto was surprised when the sentence came out, but the couple’s faces were shocked and distorted. Surprise, they ignored the threat of Buddha's eyes behind Du Lin, went to the front of Doolin and squatted down, looking down at the pair of white rhinoceros shoes on the foot of Doolin. The man's body is tight, but the woman whispers with a low voice: "If... if I can, I hope they get the retribution they deserve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The atmosphere in the whole room solidified at this moment, and Totti swallowed a sip, and he knew what the woman meant. She doesn't want money, she doesn't want her daughter to come alive, but she hopes someone can take on the "retribution" for her daughter's death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, retribution, not responsibility, retribution, blood retribution! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Totto’s eyes looked at Doolin, who hoped Dulin would agree to this request, but did not want Du Lin to agree to this request because it was too much It is. Already an innocent girl has left the world, is it still necessary for a boy who is not guilty to die to leave the world? But he can't say what he said in his heart, because he is not the deceased, he has no right to decide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has become a bit slow, and the couple’s breathing has become extremely urgent. It seems that after a year, the voice of Doolin came from the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Swear in my name and the glory of the gods..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The husband and wife are covered Huge, crouching on the ground, they moved their knees to the front of Doolin, hands with Du Lin's left hand, and the couple kissed the rare purple-red cat's eye gemstone ring on Du Lin's index finger. Then they retired some distance, kissed Doolin's leather shoes, and then kissed the ground. The two men's heads are tightly attached to the ground, and the wife has already burst into tears. Her husband is too excited to be himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
