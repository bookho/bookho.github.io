			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the statue, he raised his wrist and looked at the watch. At the end of the auction, there were still more than a dozen auction items. Du Lin did not have it until now. It is not true that the participants did not express their dedication and love for society. Of course, he can also shoot the latter things, he flipped through the album, and most of the latter are things like art paintings. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prices of various artworks have grown by leaps and bounds in the rapid recovery of the economy in the past few years. In the past, only two or five hundred second-rate artists were allowed to work. Now it can be sold to thousands of people. Naturally, these second-rate artists have also turned into first-class artists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The art market is beginning to show clues. Compared to those inexplicable paintings, this statue looks pleasing to the eye. He lifts the sign in his hand, and Turned over one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young auctioneer immediately shouted out with a high tone in a high-pitched tone. "Oh, wow, Mr. Doolin has two thousand pieces. It’s really a big bomb. Such a big increase is very rare in this charity auction!”, it’s not a big deal to change from a thousand dollars to two thousand. The way the teacher said it gave people a kind of exquisiteness of Du Lin's true stepping horse. He really had the money to step on the horse, and he really felt the big money of the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a rich man is doing something, others will only look up to him, but when one of the group of rich people stands out from the crowd, it will inevitably be stupid. Want to try, especially this time the price increase is still stepping on someone else's face and shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cardinal sits on the sidelines and pays attention to the auction, and he is really excited. These things that are not very important in the church inventory can actually Selling so much money, you can consider cleaning up a few large warehouses after you go back, and you can't find something unimportant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the auctioneer’s ignorance, no one has refuted Du Lin’s face, which is one of the biggest features of the charity auction – a higher increase The furious price means that the bidder has a strong desire for the auction, which is mostly seen in the auctioneer's shooting of the items he sent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you send a piece worth one thousand pieces to participate in the filming, when the item arrives, the owner of the item will shout out two thousand or three. The price of a thousand pieces means that this thing is mine. I will donate several times the price to buy this stuff back. Don’t grab it with me. This is my beloved thing, and my face is beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are exceptions. There are no shortage of people in the world who have unique ideas and like to break the rules. Most of the time, they use the upstarts as representatives of this kind. I took it to the original owner several times or even ten times the price, or left it myself. Their shouting is not entirely to destroy this rule or like this thing. Sometimes it is to hold the original. The master's scene, but they do not know, this will not only have a good effect, but will make people feel that they are not polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this item is excluded, because the church people have no price, others are relatively free, but Du Lin still shows his will Others also smiled and looked at Du Lin, closing his mouth and congratulating him in advance for the statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three falling hammers, the statue belongs to Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was not much turmoil until all the items were auctioned, and Du Lincai and Cardinal and two aristocratic representatives boarded the stage at the charity auction. Then there is a charity fundraising, which is linked together. Otherwise, how does Du Lin donate hundreds of millions of properties to the city hall in the face of so many celebrities, how can he show that he is a socially responsible person? Young entrepreneurs? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two humility, the microphone was handed over to Doolin’s hand. After he smiled and nodded to the cardinal and noble representatives, he took a step forward. “Thank you very much for taking the time to participate in this charity event, thank you all...” After a round of applause, he thought of something interesting and suddenly smiled. “My origins are known to everyone. ......", this sentence makes people realize why he laughs, and he laughs with his heart. "Yes, I am a farmer's son. I never avoid it because I think this is Not a shameful thing, I will be proud of it, I will tell everyone, I am the son of a farmer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I was young I have tasted the taste of poverty. I have experienced the rancidity of despair. I deeply know that in a corner of this society that is not being noticed, there is a group of people who need help in the black desperation like death. Decay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;"They need our help, maybe just a few dollars, they can save a father, save a mother, or even save a family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and spit it out, and his tone became deeper. "The sun can't reach them. No one can help them. They can only fall into the abyss in despair and rot in the corners of society. "He paused a little while talking about it, brewing the atmosphere, and then suddenly the tone became violent like a volcanic eruption, "but we can!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Sunlight can't warm them, we can!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Faith can't make them full, we can!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as we lend a helping hand, we can save countless families in this society, let them deviate from the most miserable track in life, let them get a new life, and be able to re-enter the warmth In the sun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This hand of aid is called charity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Individuals have the power to live, others can't give them, let's give them!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today, the contribution of each of us is not meaningless. This is not for a decent topic when you are chatting, because we are doing good deeds. We helped. Others, this should not be a kind of talk, it is an insult to charity, this should be a kind of pride!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I helped with the way I could. More people are out of the woods, I can see the tears on their faces when they are redeemed, and I can see their bright smiles when they go to a new life. This is a great power, a kind of deep shock to the entire human race. Great power!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Some stupid people say charity is a hypocrisy, I cast aside them, I despise them, there is no higher in this world than we are. People, because we don't ask for help, because we are kind, kind, and awe of life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to understand how to understand To be a person, you must first understand how to fear life. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what we have been doing and will continue to do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Du Lin said that there was some slight asthma here. He was roaring almost all the time. He was roaring, and the whole lawn was silent. Only his voice was spreading and he was taken farther by the wind. He paused for a moment and his voice was calmed down. He once again showed a smile, a glaring smile, really like a smile like a flash. "I donate a million here in my own name. The money is used to help all those in need, and I will set up a charitable foundation to invest millions of dollars in charitable causes."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I may not be able to help everyone who needs me, but I will do everything I can to help everyone I have the ability to help them. I am not noble or pure, I am just for the peace of mind and for life. Awe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He succumbs to everyone and salutes, "Thank you, thank you for your patience to listen to me, and to everyone who is caring. The care of the disadvantaged groups, you are all angels."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dooling returns to the back, everyone gets up and applauds him, and he may not have spoken too much. Skills, but enough to shock people. The long applause is the best comment on what he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reporters on the side are crazy. In the notebook, I recorded what Du Lin said just now. The spotlights are repeatedly lit up, and all the reporters know that tomorrow. The news is going to burst! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Du Lin’s words, the cardinal’s throat slipped twice and decided to shut up, then handed the microphone to the two noble representatives behind him. The two aristocratic representatives always maintained a decent smile. The two looked at each other and no longer spoke any words to resonate. They just followed Du Lin silently and donated 500,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such an opening, all the people who participated in this charity event were generous, with a thousand and a few thousand, which made the cardinal The bishop must laugh at the mouth, and this time I really made a big profit. As for Du Lin’s words, I slammed the question of faith a little... Is that a problem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course not! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the fundraising, everyone is about to end, Du Lin once again came to power, and announced a message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be engaged to Miss Ophelia Timamont in the near future. This invitation can also be used as an invitation to the engagement ceremony to attend my engagement ceremony. In addition, in order to thank God for bringing my dear Ophelia to my side, I will donate 30% of the estate in Otis..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
