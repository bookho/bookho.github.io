			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s group discussed the next year’s work in Henry’s estate, and outside the manor, the agent of the Organized Crime Investigation Bureau, Agents from the Police Liberation Bureau of Veril are sitting together and chatting. They haven't been able to buy any of the Guarts who can participate in such high-level meetings so far. Those people's minds seem to be made of stone. No matter what the government promises, they are not willing to cooperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that they even issued a "special pardon order" that promises to forgive all crimes and a "criminal license" that cannot be disclosed to the public. As long as they can help the Anti-Organizational Crime Investigation Bureau find Du Lin’s evidence and take Du Lin’s arrest and arrest, then the person who made the outstanding contribution will be allowed to “legally” in a certain city. A criminal act that causes harm to citizens. For example, smuggling, opening a casino or operating some illegal entertainment projects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, no one is willing to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Analysis Office believes that this may be related to Doolin’s high-pressure fear. More than one person was alive and peeled in the process of Du Lin’s family, and they tried to pass The limited guar literature found relevant ceremonial penalties, of which peeling is the most horrible punishment. In the cultural and historical context of the Guars, any person or organization that sells the interests of the Guars, any Guart has the right to peel and expose them for three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cruel lynching runs through the history of the Guarts, except for a guy who has no name and is known as a "faceless". After three days of living, thousands of people who have been subjected to skinning will no longer be alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Anti-Organizational Crime Investigation Bureau and the Security Committee and the Military Intelligence Service, the deception of religious beliefs is supplemented by fear and interest, that is, Doolin maintains this organization. means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now they are getting more and more jealous...", this time a small leader who was responsible for taking photos on the spot while drinking coffee, said and chatted, " We find that these people's criminal methods are more and more concealed, and the most troublesome is that their criminal behavior is rapidly decreasing, which will become one of the biggest obstacles for us to break the Doolin criminal group."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fight between fellowships and agents has been reduced a lot. After all, this criminal group has already passed the initial stage of its founding. In the beginning, they had to rob more market share and sales from other offenders through violent means. No one would let their own interests be harmed by others, and there would be no second type other than fighting. Solution. This has allowed a large number of big people in the underground world to emerge frequently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, "Black Widow" Ms. Sophia, "The Executioner" Mr. Budi, "Blood Butcher" Mr. Adams..., and so on, there are dozens of clubs or agents with their own resounding names. However, with the stability of the business of the township associations and agents, Du Lin began to advocate “peace trade” and began to transform internally. The number of crimes committed by the township associations and agents began to decline sharply. Some city associations and agents We have not engaged in any criminal activity for more than a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people even took the initiative to participate in charity evenings, often donating large sums of charity to win a very positive evaluation in society, plus Dooling in public opinion Always maintain a positive image. With Du Lin as an example, more and more fellow villagers will begin to participate in social charity activities, such as helping poor families and providing free medical care for poor families. The activities have won the support of many poor people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that Du Lin’s smuggling channels have begun to transform quietly. Now it’s not just the rapid circulation of Doolin’s private liquor in these channels. There are other wineries that flow in Doolin's channels, and in addition to Doolin's vegetables are transported to the Empire through this channel. It is said that a retail giant has recently planned to negotiate with Du Lin about the intention of cooperation. The retail giant has taken advantage of Du Lin’s cheap transportation costs (marine shipping) and perfect network coverage. He hopes to cooperate with Du Lin to build his own shopping mall. All of Doolin’s smuggling network can reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the transformation is completed and there is no strong evidence to pull Doolin down, it is likely that this criminal organization will become a business group, they are distributed in the empire Everywhere, doing the right trade and work, at that time, the difficulty of catching them will multiply! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the reason why the upper level is almost annoyed recently. Du Lin is too embarrassed, too treacherous, too much to step on the horse, honestly a crime Is the organization leader not good? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers of the Anti-Organizational Crime Investigation Bureau have a deep understanding of this, but the detectives of the Van Lier Police Investigation Bureau have a little doubt, "Why is this why? When you don’t have some evidence in your hands, you can catch those who can be convicted. I don’t believe that a large number of middle-level backbones will be arrested and will not hurt any of Doolin.” His idea is very Correctly, any organization that truly maintains is the middle backbone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an organization, a force, or even a company, high-level changes will not trigger any crisis in the company. Changes in equity are common and there is no Which company went bankrupt because the board had one more shareholder or one less shareholder company. The same is true of the organization. It is normal for the more high-level group changes like this to be more normal. It has become a regular phenomenon. It is only a matter for the leader to add a high-level figure. The following will naturally take the initiative to adapt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case at the top, and the bottom is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grassroots is the most important part of the country, but the lowest level of membership is not the most important part of any organizational power, because as long as there is With enough appeal, they will be able to get a steady stream of underlying supporters. In this ever-changing society, there are always people who add to these forces for money, power, or something else. This is common. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only middle-level cadres cannot be changed frequently, but this is not important for Du Lin’s fellowship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if we catch a hundred middle-level cadres, there will be one and one middle-level cadres tomorrow. The president, agent, and team leader will be the system of the association. It’s just a symbol, not a complete power, and the symbol is given to Doolin. People believe in Doolin, so it’s no good to catch more. Now I can only hope that Du Lin’s mistakes in decision-making will give We found the opportunity to defeat him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside people are discussing the recent development of Doolin, and in the manor, Du Lin is also discussing the next year. development of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So far our power has covered 50% of the empire, this is very good, but not enough, still need to speed up the surrounding cities Infiltration, strive to expand coverage to 70% or even 18%!", Doolin's hand wrapped in a white long scarf, a faint smudge in the long towel. He stood in the middle of the restaurant, and the attention of the people around him was concentrated on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than 200 cities in the empire, excluding some villages and towns and settlements. The current agent system has covered 100 cities. It can be said that In every two cities in the empire, there is an agent. But Dooling is not satisfied with the current disk. He hopes to make more progress and increase the coverage by at least twenty points. Once the agent has stabilized, the fellowship will follow, which means that the city's Guarts have entered the network of fellowships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-two years ago, in the empire’s demographic report, the Guars occupied about 15 percent of the total population of the Empire, and at the end of last year the Empire official In the total population statistics, the total population of the entire empire is 217 million people. According to the official, the total population of the guates should be about 30 million. But in fact, the total population of the Guartes is far lower than this figure, because in the federal war of the Great Patriotic War, that is, in the Civil War, a large number of Guars were forced to enlist in the army and participated in the fierce battle. war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
