			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original imposing innkeeper’s eyes were rounded, and when she was about to open her mouth, the colorful things in front of her attracted her attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s twenty, no, because the smell of the ink on the piece of paper and the lines that are mysterious art pieces are all manifestations. The value of Zhang Xiaoka. The lines on her face softened in an instant, and the eyes burst into a seam. She tentatively extended two fingers, pinched the corner of the banknote, and gently pumped it. The banknote was immediately transferred from the hands of Hanler to her fingertips. There was a flash of surprise in her eyes, and she smiled and nodded her head and took two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, young people are always so enthusiastic, I can understand that I also experienced such a thing...", she glanced at Han Le's block and the thickness of his arm, the active understanding of the atmosphere, and then turned and snarled loudly against the corridor. De, it’s time to raise your rent!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hotel was quiet again, Hanler closed the door, closing the door was like a signal, the two immediately Moved up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Anna’s understanding of Walter, Walter is balanced in all aspects, there are no particularly powerful projects, and there is no obvious weakness, but he has a Stunt, that is the flying knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His flying knife is not necessarily accurate, but it must be very fast, his hands and wrists are wrapped in twelve flying knives, a total of twenty-four There are many. He used to shoot twenty-four flying knives in four seconds, enough to imagine how much effort he had made in this regard. Moreover, Walter practiced these flying knives together with Anna. When they were together with a group of metamorphosis, if they were invariant, they felt that it would be difficult to integrate into this abnormal circle. He always added something to himself to keep himself in the same place. The "circle" did not throw out, and finally, at the proposal of Anna, he began to practice flying knives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to shoot, only to shoot fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is not big, the flying knife is very suitable, Anna does not dare to care, directly pull the trigger continuously, and also quickly avoids no connection with Walt Any obstruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullets are very fast, but the flying knives are also very fast. People are people, not monsters. Anna’s shooting method is very accurate. Walter has two shots. However, Walter's rate of fire is not slow, even this time the head is surprisingly high, and Anna has inserted seven different flying knives. The two stood on the sides of the table, panting with a big mouth and a mouthful of time, just enough time for their physical strength to drop rapidly. After all, they are not young, and all aspects of the body have been on the downhill road for many years. They are no longer young and can hold high-intensity battles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ansie smiled and threw the pistol on the floor. She had four flying knives on her chest. Each of the flying knives had more than half of her body, the lower abdomen. There were also three inserted in it, almost completely immersed in her body. She knew that she was dead, and if such an injury could not be treated immediately, it would take only two minutes for her to die. It seems that these people are impossible to call her an ambulance, and the ambulance seems to be too late, this time is different from the last time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, she does not intend to continue to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She held the chair and sat down on the front of the chair, her face showing a painful look from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her opposite, Walter stood facelessly, his shoulder and arm shot, his face did not change, but his eyes were cheating He can't be human, he has a different idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Anna is not aiming at his key points? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we let the couple talk about the conversation?", Anna snorted with a spurt of blood, turned to look at Layton and he was rumored to be green Son, "just for a moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Layton nodded, he has confirmed that Anna must die, no one can violate the principle of black posts, so he must Make sure that Anna must die before he can leave for a while. Finally, looking at Anna sitting in the chair and Walter standing in the cold, Leighton sighed with a son and turned away from the room, leaving the last time to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they left, Walter said: "We are not husbands and wives. It is an enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Anna smiled and squirted another blood. After the internal organs were exposed to an open injury, the air entered the abdomen. Some organs, for example, the intestines began to swell, and some blood in the body would be sprayed when the internal pressure rose sharply. The way to discharge it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, we are husband and wife, we have a wedding, we must be a husband and wife...", she said, slamming her head, holding a letter knife on the table and inserting it on her lap. The severe pain caused the newly rising sense of drowsiness to fade away. "Time has taught me a lot of things. I have been looking for you for so many years...", she said she pulled the necklace around her neck and put it on. On the table at hand, "This is my most precious thing, I always want to give this thing to you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She vomited with a big mouth Blood, suddenly there was an abnormal blush on her face, which made her look like she had some spirit. "I think every night, I am remembering..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you just want to say these nonsense, I don't think it's necessary to continue." Walter glanced sideways at the wall clock on the wall, and there were dozens of seconds until twelve o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, listen to me!", Anna suddenly squirmed in the squat, this screamed over her strength and life. After she vomited a few mouthfuls of blood again, she calmed down and her eyes began to dim. "It’s too late, too late...", her eyes slowly rolling, like the old man of eighty or ninety years old. It was extremely difficult to move my eyes. When her eyes finally fell on Walter, there was a ray of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been chasing you for more than 20 years, but I just want to say sorry to you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The leader said that after the death, the soul will be redeemed, I will die in your hands, then I can see them after death and say sorry to them? I miss him!", Anna is full of expectations Looking at Walter eagerly, just watching, even if Walter is cheating her, she can satisfy. But she just looked at it, just looking at it... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt did not answer this question, he went to the table and took the blood-covered pendant in his hand, opened it and put it in his pocket. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the twelve o'clock bell rang and echoed over the entire city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can understand Walter’s fear of Anna, he has feared almost... No, he is already mentally ill. He has serious hallucinations and illusions. Once he is drunk with alcohol, he can see Anna appear in front of him and then plung the knife into his body. But now Walter has a strange feeling that can't be said. The person who should be arrogant and revenge is scared. The woman who should have been his nightmare has chased him for so many years not to kill him. He just wants to say sorry. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men sat in the car and opened the area outside the city. Walt looked back at Tener in the dark from time to time, and his mood was very complicated. He doesn't know what Anna has experienced and can become like this. Maybe people will always change? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there wine?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laiden helped him bandage the wound and took a bottle of unopened wine from the co-pilot's storage box and threw it to him, "If you want Let the old guy yell at you, you can drink a little more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whit smiles and unscrews the lid of the bottle, filling it with a big mouth, he just wants now Drunk is unconscious. At the same time, two soldiers who had just assisted a girl who had lost a student’s aid to the school returned to the hotel. At the moment they opened the door, two people The body is obviously shaking. Because they saw their chiefs in the blood sitting on the chair and lost their lives, even an ordinary colonel’s inexplicable death here is enough to make the Imperial Army shake, not to mention that Anna belongs to the most special department of the empire. And the position is very high, this is definitely not a trivial matter, enough to be treated as the most advanced crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, people from the Southwest Military Region arrived here. In addition to investigating and collecting evidence, they also placed a black envelope and card with blood. In the suitcase, it was sent to the Ministry of Defense. Two soldiers who came with Anna have been restricted from personal freedom and have been severely interrogated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This empire is never as simple as it appears on the surface... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not aware that the biggest crisis for himself has been quietly resolved. He includes Mr. Xmas and other than Walter. Everyone outside will not know that the woman’s pursuit of catching them behind their buttocks is not as simple as it used to be. She does not want to use Mr. Ma’s head to exchange power. Status or wealth. She just wants to find the man through Mr. Kesma and then say sorry to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The years are a magical thing, no one can stay the same under the erosion of the years, everyone will change in the years. From immature to mature, physical changes, psychological changes. No one knows what Anna has changed over the years, she has any thoughts, but it all disappeared with her "plan." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
