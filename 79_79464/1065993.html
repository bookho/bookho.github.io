			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Torn Valley game today is awesome because there is a woman on the court. The female warrior is obviously more attractive than the killing between the male warrior and the predators. People always have the sympathy and recognition of the weak, and hope that the female warrior can smoothly clear the customs, kill all the predators, and have a deep desire in the heart, eager for those predators to tear the female warrior Fragmented and swallowed into the belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contradictory mood makes people pay more attention to this fight, Henry is also the same, his emotions have long been mobilized, and even plan to spend 100,000 Let people lose some weapons and equipment, so that the female warriors can overcome those predators. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When being disturbed at such an important time, Henry must have been unhappy. He sipped a few words and walked behind the believer to a room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charles, I need an explanation!", Henry looked at the decoration in the room, he went to the wine cabinet and took out a bottle of wine to unscrew , poured a cup for himself. The battle just was very intense and exciting. The female body is far less strong than the male in the battle. There are always a few thrilling moves in each fight, and the heart is always hanging. Now just drink a drink and suppress the tension and ease the tension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles smiled and pulled Du Lin into it. He was sure to become the elder of the Mother Earth, but the ceremony was not held yet, now his Position is second only to God, and it can be said that there is a high weight in the Tushen. It wasn’t the time to come to him. The person who introduced Henry into the Tushenism was not him, but recently everyone knew that Henry and Doolin were very close, and the things that happened this time were a bit tricky, so the last decision was to let Charles Talk to Henry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check out where the problem is, now it’s OK to identify the woman’s intelligence agent, and find records from the items she carries with me. Part of the list of the party members, this list alone can explain the problem, and people also found a special pistol disguised as a cigarette case. This discovery made the gods and listeners very headaches. They worked here for decades to disintegrate all the stubborn persistences, eroded all the important local figures, and began to gradually expand the Tushenism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result has not been expanded for a few years, but it has been discovered by outside intelligence personnel and has also penetrated into the party. Once the Tushenism is exposed to the public, it is likely to be hit hard by the empire. Decades of hard work will be destroyed, and it is not allowed to do such things up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina was temporarily detained in the dungeons of the Tushen, and now they have to make sure that there is no relationship between Katrina and Henry. If there is, it means that Henry is also a problem. Although Henry is the son of the tycoon, they have the means to let Henry disappear. Instead of killing him, he was put under house arrest in some way, so that he could not be free for three or five years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Henry had no problems, they needed to know who Henry brought Catalina into here and then found the person in question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outbreak of anything will definitely have a node that must exist. Catalina can’t actively approach Henry and ask to come in without knowing anything. There must have been something that they didn't know, but it was necessary to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Henry...", as Henry lifted his glass and prepared to drink, Charles went forward and pressed Henry with a glass of wine. In his hand, he smiled and was as gentle and kind as before. "I don't understand a few things. I hope you can solve these puzzles for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry For a moment, this move was very rude. He lifted his arm hard, but he was very embarrassed to find that his power was not as good as Charles, the little old man, laughing and putting the glass back on the table. He looked at Charles. Asked, "What happened? What can I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles also took back his arm, he always kept a kind smile," Your female companion, do you know her identity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean Catherine?", Henry asked, then shook his head. Said, "No, I don't know what she is doing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is her own Come here, is someone please you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry immediately realized what, "Where is she, what happened?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Answer my question, Mr. Henry, this is very important!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry at this time has realized that Katrina’s There may be problems with his identity. Although he doesn't have a good brain, he can still guess what these ordinary people should know. He looked at Charles in amazement and said a lie. "I don't know. I met her at a dance last time. I was drinking too much. You know that men drink more and then in front of beautiful women. I want to brag about it, I said I know a better place..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles squinted at the corner of his eye. He believed that Henry could do such a move. It might even be that Catalina was attracted by Henry’s previous boast, but these were not only to prove that Henry was a strange creature without a brain. It can't prove anything else. There is also a possibility, there is a third person, otherwise Catherine will not seize the opportunity so accurately and Henry mixed up and came here. Charles organized the language and asked, "You recall, in the process of knowing Ms. Catalina, is there anyone else involved, or is it that you are going to pursue her?" Positive thoughts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry shook his head after meditation, and Charles sighed. "Mr. Henry, Ms. Catalina has some problems. Just now she tried to steal our valuable items and we found out that we had expelled her. Next time, Mr. Henry, don’t bring this unclear person here next time. This is my advice to you. The apostle is very angry. If there is another time, we will deprive you of your identity and will not allow you to come here again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry listened The world is really incredible, and the woman that Du Lin pushed to him is actually a thief? God is on, Du Lin must have been deceived by this beautiful woman. He nodded his head at this moment. "Do not worry, I will not bring people here afterwards."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles smiled and nodded, then poured a little wine for himself, and took the initiative to touch Henry’s glass on the table. "A drink, relax, do what you like." Do something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Henry left, Charles sat for a while, and after a moment he shook his head and stood up into the cave. There is still a space in the deeper places, and the tops of the Tushen are here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, ask what is the situation?", speaking is the god, the top of the structure of the Tushe is the god, or the apostle, he It is the messenger of the Austrian will and is said to be able to communicate with the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles sat at a round table and he shook his head. "I didn't ask anything of value, it should be this called Catalina." The woman took the initiative to hook up Henry, and then let Henry take her to come here, Henry should be unaware of it." When it came to this, Charles couldn’t help but add a sentence, "With his mind, he can’t do this. Things, I suspect there are other participants, but we have nothing to discover now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
