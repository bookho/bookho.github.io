			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Codor is angry at this time, but also extremely fearful, he can't believe that Prando will lie to him to the window and tell him The boss of the big boss came, and even more afraid that Prando would not hesitate to take out the pistol and fired a shot at him. This gun does not kill him. It is difficult to threaten a person's life with a shoulder injury. This is the knowledge he has mastered through countless times of practice. He could clearly feel the bullet in his shoulder, and it was because of the tremendous power generated by the bullet in his shoulder that he lost his balance - by the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear of slanting and stagnation made Godor struggle, but it also speeded up his fall from the window. He rolled over and fell from the window, and the wind whistling and smirking in his ear, like those tyrannical tycoons in his eyes, which made him particularly unhappy. The atmosphere of the earth is getting thicker and thicker. He has already smelled a hint of earth in the frenzied wind. The next second, slamming, everything is calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a frightening look at the hind heel stepping on his already broken head, and the slanting slanting of the body was slammed on the floor. Even if Gothor's head is hard enough, when his heel can step on his head, his ending is already doomed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood splashed far away, and some white flowers were scattered like the milk that was put at the bottom of the bed for a few days in the summer, and the trembling swayed out. Very far away, contaminated with dust and dirt. The red thorns when the hot blood was scattered broke the black and white picture. After a short silence, people burst into screams and angry shouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Codor is dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando looked indifferently to the window and inserted the pistol into the holster. He used his own sizzling eyes to break his eyes. The last bit of mercy. In his heart, he constantly looked at the singer, like the same pile of rotten meat, and the only thing in his heart disappeared. He felt that this was not the fault of the boss, nor was it his own fault. The fault was that he had himself. He doesn't live up to expectations, isn't he? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are just tools, and when the tools are not easy, we can only change one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect it, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of a slight voice Prando’s heart shook like the wind that happened when Cedore fell from the window. I don’t know if there is such a process when Cedore falls. His scalp was slightly numb, his neck was stiff, and the pistol that had just been inserted into the holster was pulled out. But before he turned back, one arm was pressed against his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a side face, the guy who is a Xien. At this moment, his mind flashed countless thoughts, his eyes gradually smashed, his eyes were insidious and determined. Just as he wanted to make a decision, Xiu En turned his head and looked at him, greeted his gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to marry me?", Xiuen laughed. "Is it really interesting?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando, who was stunned by the mind, was drenched with a bucket of cold water. He did have this idea. If it was Xiu En, he died in order to get some information. Undoubtedly the perfect ending, people will make up enough motivation for all these things - Xiu En is a detective of the Police Investigation Bureau in the city of Tener, maybe he saw it from the Chowdor Returning to the opportunity of the center, regardless of others blocking the cruel confession of the singer. The tight-lipped Gedor chose to use death to keep the secrets of his stomach in the face of the brutal torture of Sin, so he took the initiative to jump from the upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Prando can clean up the troubles of his own, and at the same time let the big boss know that he really is doing the work seriously, while still Can you push Xiu En to the opposite side of some big bosses, isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shen has seemingly doing nothing on the surface, not being fooled with the hot girl all day, drinking and intoxicating, but Prando has never relaxed the alert to the grace. Be alert. The little things he can pretend not to know, let the chaos come in chaos, for example, stealing his drink, such as stealing his paradise, but in the big things, he is absolutely strictly guarded. Even Prando sometimes suspects that Xiuen’s current appearance is his true performance, or that he is waiting for the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, Xiu En was a big man. If he did something big, he was taken to such a place. He must be unwilling to do so. Some people think that the city of Ternell, which belongs to the old party's sphere of influence, is the breakthrough point for breaking the old party defense in Cannes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not impossible. If you can use this opportunity to plunge into the Xien, his superiors, whether they exist or not, will definitely be disappointed with him. Instead of abandoning him, he will gradually disappear into people's sights until they disappear forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plan is perfect, at least in the last second, but after being shouted, Prando doesn't think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come you have this idea? We are friends!" Prando inserted the pistol back into the gun bag. The smile on his face was like a flower in the midsummer, and the brilliant light reflected the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a meaningful pat on his shoulder and leaned over to look downstairs. At this moment, Prando had almost an instant suppression. The urge to live, he wants to push Xiun. But after all, he didn't dare to do this because Xien is really different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Guards and Defense Investigation Bureau is not the same as other institutions. In fact, there has been an unspeakable situation in the empire since the feudal monarchy. That is, most regions have a tendency to get rid of central control, faint independence, but there is no real independence. At that time, the power of the nobles was too strong, and the history of one aristocratic ruled one area can often be traced back to five or six hundred years ago. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a long rule, people living in aristocratic territories often only recognize the aristocracy's rule over them, not from the emperor's rule. In order to change the situation in which the royal family began to feel fear, there was the predecessor of the Imperial Police Investigation Bureau, the Imperial Emergency Special Operations Team. The work of this team on the official level is to deal with the relief work of some natural disasters and the prevention of natural disasters. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the actual function is to monitor the aristocracy around the country. Once the nobility has created an independent or rebellious sign, it is necessary to assassinate the nobleman as quickly as possible. The Imperial Emergency Task Force has completed many missions for more than a hundred years, the most surprising of which was the death of the former Duke of Gwalen. In the newspaper and the official height of the unity, the Duke of Gwalen took his family to go out in the wild after the rainstorm, accidentally met the mudslide, and then the family returned to the embrace of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Operations Team rescued the grandson of Gvalen from the disaster. For the next twenty years, the grandson’s grandson was gambling because of eating and drinking. Proficient, unfortunately died early, completely ruined the name of Guvalen. As for the truth, it is not important. What is important is that the deterrence of this department has long been rooted in the hearts of many big people. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the New Party’s “rebellion”, the Imperial Emergency Task Force was not banned, but was absorbed by the Imperial Guards and Defense Investigation Bureau, so that there was such a One saying is that the "rebellion" of the New Party is actually acquiesced by the emperor and the royal family. Their purpose is to change the increasingly dangerous situation and prevent the collapse of the empire. As mentioned above, what is the truth is no longer important. It is important that Prando knows that even if he is a meditation and a jerk, he can't do anything about Xiu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
