			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris is a stubborn gang who has been a gang since he was fourteen. He has been in prison for three times in the past two decades. The first two times were due to murderous fighting. In order to climb up, he was detained for two years and three years for the crime of assault. For the third time, there were some problems within the gang. When dealing with the traitors, they were accidentally witnessed by the ordinary citizens and reported to the police. He sinned for the gang’s big boss and closed for six years. It can be said that since he joined the gang, almost half of his time has been spent in prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allowed him to accumulate a very old qualification and also established his position in the gang, especially when he helped the big boss to sin. At that time, a total of four people died. According to the imperial law, Morris should be sentenced to hanged. However, it was at the time when the war was about to erupt, and the whole society was paying attention to the war, not to the gangs of a certain country city, and how many people died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big boss of the gang is moved by his own men or by Morris for his charge, he must make a boss. thing. He spent about 20,000 pieces before and after, bought a judge from the City Council of Tener, bought a prosecutor, and bought a state prosecutor. Eventually Morris was sentenced to "justifiable defense" and "manslaughter", plus The lawyer's clever tongue and the Jin Yuan offensive, Morris was sentenced to 10 years in prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the last day of his sixth year in prison, he was allowed to be released on bail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving the prison, the boss decided to arrange a good job for him, that is to raise funds for the gang. This kind of work is called a fisherman in the gang, and Morris is also very grateful. Before he came out, he thought that he should almost be abandoned by the gang. After he came out and gave three or five thousand pieces, he would find a place to fend for himself. Unexpectedly, the big boss actually remembered him, not only took him out in advance, but also gave him a good job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris’s self-motivation has been exhausted in the prison of eleven years, and he is very satisfied with the work of getting such a pension. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of this work, he has shifted his hobby from getting higher status and power to how to make himself happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to mention here that Morris joined the gang at the age of fourteen because he fell mad and liked a girl, then The humiliation of the beggar. The girl came from a big city, her family was good, and she was well educated. The reason why she came to Tener was because she didn't know where to go during the summer, and she came to Tener with her classmates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the girl raised her head arrogantly and looked at Morris’s slightly dirty clothes with a scornful look, the dusty cheeks, and then mocked him with a careless tone, Morris felt himself What should be changed, not backwards in the girl's eyes full of aggressive eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tells himself that he is not wrong, he just likes beauty, and he is not wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there is Morris today, and I like to use my own way to conquer those girls who seem to have culture to fill the hearts of their youth. shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also very sensible, because he never touches those who seem to have money, because he knows that he can't afford to be rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he slowly raised his hands, his eyes dripping, and he wanted to find something that could be reflected from the walls of the surrounding room. When I look at who is behind the scenes, he looks for opportunities and slows down his tone. This is not the first time he has experienced it. A few years ago, when he drank more people and went home, he also happened in an alley. Such a thing. And he was able to stand here today, which shows that he did not have anything to do at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This friend, if I have inadvertently offended you, I apologize to you for my fault. If you just want to improve your life, on the hanger There are my clothes on it, there are almost a hundred pieces inside, you can take them all...", he slowly talked about turning back, just at this time, a slamming sound, a blunt instrument The sly cockroach was on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back of the human brain is very fragile, not as hard as the forebrain. After being stunned, Morriston felt that two heat flows down the nose and went outside. Drill. And he himself was also beaten forward, bent down and lowered his head, half a squat on the ground. He touched his nose and looked at it, not blood, but a transparent liquid. He felt a bit inexplicable, but he didn't know that nosebleeds were far better than flowing this transparent liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that thing is called cerebrospinal fluid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief tense, there was a burst of pain in the back of the brain, and the brain swelled and swelled. He was just about to stand up, and a huge force fell on his ass and threw him on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrestling is not comfortable, especially at this time, Morris is still naked, the skin that has just been bathed is like the most effective brake pad, rubbing and making a loud noise. There was a heavy footstep behind him, followed by a dirty boot that he had looked even lazy before, and he stepped on the back of his hand. He just shouted out, and the corner of his eye was I saw a black shadow, and then the whole head was kicked and picked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his consciousness has begun to blur, someone turned him over, his eyes suddenly stunned, on the sofa not far from him, Sitting a teenager. He met this boy three days ago. In the bar called Golden Crystal, he remembered how he refused the good intentions of the other party and pushed the other side to the Jedi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the situation is reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe Morris feels that he is a gang after all, and there are also big bosses to take care of themselves, some of the fame in the city of Tener, the previous weakness suddenly became When he got stronger, he snorted and yelled: "Are you crazy? Are you crazy for more than a thousand dollars?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mad?", Doolin shrugged his shoulders. "Maybe. When someone blocked my financial path, I was already crazy. I don't know if you have heard of a guar slang - when you When you cut off the financial path of others to get money, it is like you killed his parents by yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf's forgotten stepping on Morris's palm Du Lin glanced at him and then recalled with his muscle-filled head. It seems that he had heard of this sentence, but he could not remember it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murris smiled after listening to it. "A land of more than a thousand dollars is also a financial road?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head, "It’s 100,000!", just as Morris was horrified, Du Lin stood up from the couch, walked to Morris, and took a photo of Morris. Maintenance of the face, "Goodbye!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment of saying this, he picked up the empty bottle at the table, sly Kneeling on Morris's head. A muffled sound, like the sound of the bowstring being pulled, the bottle broke open, and then Du Lin took the pointed end and licked it into Morris's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
