			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After paying Kevin’s commission, Du Lin returned to Otis alone. He just returned to his butt and didn’t heat up the chair. Dove’s coffee was still Without overshadowing the cup, Natalie knocked on the door and came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?", the car that had been sitting for a long time made Du Lin feel a little tired. He leaned back in his chair and licked the temple that was too a bit sullen. Look at Natalie standing at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natalie’s lips moved, I don’t know how to open it, and the guys who took Du Lin’s over-compensation traveled in Nano Lindes. came back. They want to find a place to live close to the city center and are now negotiating with the bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial central bank is not sure what Du Lin said last time is to play, or really intend to expel these people, not let them return, So I have been looking for an excuse to postpone the matter. Just as Du Lin came back, the bank called Natalie and asked her about Du Lin’s attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very simple matter, it is not allowed to buy a house directly, but the imperial central bank governor of Otis is like a scavenger. I haven't seen the money back in a few years. Now someone is willing to buy a house in his hand, which is also very important for the bank. Banks rarely play long-term investments, and they earn short-term through dismantling and lending. It’s rare to see a few hundred in a house like Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s less common that those houses not only did not raise prices, but fell down every year, and the president was crying out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone is willing to make him a little more comfortable now. He really wants to sell all the houses in one go, and then make a report to get rid of this bastard. But Du Lin opened his mouth in front of him, and the bank president did not dare to violate Du Lin’s meaning blatantly, so they wanted to test Du Lin’s attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin was just a moment of anger, they signed it immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin is true, it can only be reluctant to push the customer out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Natalie seems that this problem is not very good for export, mainly because the attitude of the bank is a bit problematic. I have to wait for it and come up with so many troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Du Lin’s re-examination, Natalie opened her mouth. “You expelled those who did not want to move out of Otis, but they came back the day before yesterday, and they plan to continue to settle in Otis, and are negotiating. The thing to buy a house."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s brow suddenly screwed up, this is not a trivial matter, it’s related to what a mayor said is not a question. It is related to the issue of the credibility of the City Hall in the minds of the public, and it must not be perfunctory. He shook his finger and clicked on the cup at his fingertips. Dove immediately raised his mouth and retreated to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you forgotten what I said last time? Let Hite drive these people out! If they don't want to go, grab them. Tied up, thrown on the steam locomotive, and sent them to the farthest place. In any case, no matter how I do it, I don’t want to see them again.” Du Lin was a little angry, he wouldn’t do anything if he’s not in this group of bastards. What? They should not be allowed to get off at the beginning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natalie was fired by Doolin, a little wronged, biting her lip and turning out. After she conveyed Doolin’s opinion to Hite, Hite immediately rushed to the bank with a horse. For Hite, the police chief, or any other identity, is only behind. His true identity is the leader of the fellowship, and this is his job. Du Lin told him his mission, that is his first task, everything else is not important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen horses run quite a bit on the dusty and muddy streets, and the dust is like a cavalry decades ago. At that time, many people have hid aside. Not afraid of being hit by Hite, but afraid of the dust that rises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they got outside the bank, they rushed in directly, and they saw that the 30s and 40s were crowded in the bank’s rude hall, and the two receptionists were still giving them Refill and send fruit. When these people saw Hite, they didn't mean to be afraid at all. Until Hite came to them, they realized that Hite came here to find them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at some of them standing up, Hite didn’t panic. He looked at these people up and down and left and then asked, “May Doolin As I said it last time, you have been expelled from the city of Otis. You are not allowed to enter the city of Otis without a pardon of the mayor of Doolin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Some people have a scared expression on their faces, but some people laughed and laughed. One of the sturdy men broke free from the arms of the woman around them and went straight to Hite. This guy is very strong, his sleeves are tight with his arms on his arms, and his face looks unbearable. He is half a head taller than Heite, and the two are almost already stuck together. He suddenly turned his nose and licked his nose, rubbed some sticky liquid left on his bones with his fingers, and slowly pressed it on Hite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I lived in Otis for the rest of my life. For the first time I heard that someone would not let me go home?", his tone was full of disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy has some cows and sheep, and some dogs. His profession is a butcher. Because of the nature of his work, his body is very strong, and often killing animals, so that he has a strong suffocation. Hate looked down at the small trace of his chest and then took a step back. I can say that this guy is laughing, "Apologize, then take out with your family, I don't want to do it in front of so many people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The butcher seemed to regard Hite's action as a concession. He stepped out and the wife behind him grabbed his arm and shook his head in pleading, saying that he advised him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that this guy has a bad temper and think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature and mentality of practitioners in such industries are not good, and the hard-working animals, especially cattle and dogs, are smart. The creatures will definitely have some feelings in the long-term relationship. In the end, he had to kill these "old buddies" one by one for the sake of his livelihood. He also shredded them and sold them to different people. The character could be blamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost slammed his wife out of the air, and then stepped straight to the front of Hite, raising his hand to fly the hat of Hite, and in him The chest pushed a bit. "Mayor? The mayor counts something, can you manage where I want to live? Get out, you annoying black-skinned dogs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; The police uniforms in Otis are dark, so he called the policeman Heit as a black-skinned dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hite was pushed by him, shaking his head and picking up the police cap from the ground, patted the dust on it and put it on his head again. "The last time I warned you, I will leave with your family immediately..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t finished talking yet, but the butcher has caught up and raised his fists. Playing Hai Te, when the butcher's fist is less than ten centimeters away from Hite's cheekbones, a shot is like pressing the pause button, so that everyone in the bank is fixed in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A policeman behind Hite fired, and the bullet was in the butcher's chest, probably to influence the problem, so he did not shoot at the butcher's head. The butcher squinted and looked down at a small mouth that had been torn on his clothes. After about five or six seconds, blood began to emerge. The erythema appeared on his already yellowed T-shirt and was spreading rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His body swayed a bit, and when a forward cockroach was ready to hold Hite, the gunshots rang again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gunshot finally restored the pause button, the cry of the woman’s heartbreaking resounded throughout the bank, she fell helplessly sitting on the ground, crying stand up. The faces around him were extremely ugly, and in the first few seconds they still had a lot of people gloating, seemingly waiting for the butcher to give the police a good look. But in this second, they are like the dead people at home, and they can't say the grayness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heite looked at the close, the butcher who had to hit his fist and hold his shoulder to keep the other person from falling, he was right Being his own police cap, a smile on his lips is looming. "I will inform you now that you have been attacked by police, refused to arrest, violently resist and threaten the lives of police officers. After three warnings, they refused to cooperate and use force against the killed..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and swept away the palm on his shoulder. The muscles on the butcher’s face trembled and twitched and fell to the ground after losing support. It made a loud noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hite squinted at the ground and swayed, the butcher who had been stunned shook his head, then he pulled out the pistol in the holster and took it. In my hand, I smiled and looked at other people. "If there are people who think that the city of Otis is the same place as before, it is a place where you can let the wilderness. Please stand up. If you are willing to cooperate, please take the latest steam locomotive to leave. The city of Otis, and is not allowed to come back before getting the mayor's pardon order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my last goodwill reminder and warning if someone tries to challenge The credibility of the City Hall, challenge the prestige of the police station, you can try it a little, certainly will not let you down.", he re-inserted the pistol into the holster, once again correct his own police cap, the badge is mapped to the outside The sun is particularly glaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notify the hospital and send others to leave here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people are unwilling, even with The frustrated guy took the steam locomotive for more than an hour after several police officers' escorts and left the city of Otis forever. They didn't think that one day they would leave their hometown for decades. At this time, perhaps they realized that it was not necessarily a good thing to have this money. It was not as honest as the order of the City Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
