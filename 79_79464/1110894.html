			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of gunpowder between the Empire and the Commonwealth is getting stronger and stronger. According to fairly reliable news, the border crossing between the Empire and the Commonwealth has been closed, suspended all bilateral trade. Except for a handful of businessmen who are dissatisfied with this, most people still have a positive and supportive attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m eager to retaliate back, and this time I finally got the chance that the entire imperial society is actively planning an unprecedented victory to wash the federation. The humiliation that once brought to the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal side has also performed very decisively. Mr. Sail, who has been promoting the development of this matter, has finally surpassed the joint ruling group of the United Parliament, with a kind of master. The tone of the tone, launched a war mobilization order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that he is going to fight, Du Lin is still on his journey. He has been restricted by the federal and some small countries, so the journey has become much shorter than planned. After receiving Natiya, the group continued to go south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s worth mentioning that in the Republic of Tolivia, Doolin participated in a very famous auction and found a very interesting thing. a coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coin doesn't look like the more common gold or silver coin, more like an alloy, almost as big as an egg. There are some symbols of ghosts around the front of the coin. There is a biological upper body that looks like a dragon and is not quite like a dragon. It has a bit of abstraction, and it can look like a dragonfly. Even if the triangle eyes are not modified, it gives a kind of The feeling of being inexplicably stared. The reverse side of the coin does not have any known symbols or letters that represent numbers. There is a circle of patterns that are complicated and aesthetically pleasing. There is a pattern in the pattern that looks like... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know why the world can actually see the word, but if he remembers it correctly, the pattern is actually a kind of text, not the text of the world. It is the text of the world in his dreams - the dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the reason for his interest, he is not sure if his opinion is correct, but at this moment, he would like to buy this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auctioneer on the stage is introducing the coin, which is also introduced in the auction brochure of Du Lin’s hand, but there is no more detailed content by the auctioneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a coin from the big break. The amount of unearthed is very small. From the first coin discovered in 1979, six pieces have been found all over the world. This is the seventh." The auctioneer looks very young, looks like a 30-year-old, and has a good instrument. In some large-scale auctions, it is rare to see older auctioneers. The reason is that the auction process is very long. If you are too old, you may not be able to stick to it, even if there are several breaks in the middle. Secondly, when people are older, their memory will decline, and it is difficult to recite the contents of the auction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So large auctions are often hosted by young people, and older auctioneers either host small auctions or change into Experts of various titles sit on one side to provide customers with a certain degree of authenticity services. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of the auction items by young people, many people have opened another booklet for recording the contents of the auction, of course, more People still choose to listen to the auctioneer to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Some experts in the field of archaeology and world history agree that this is a non-circulating currency before the period of great disintegration, it is more like a kind of Artworks, or medals, etc., are rewarded by high-ranking figures to their men for their appreciation. After many scholars and experts have researched and guessed, this coin is finally called a 'dragon coin'. There are some records in the handbook of the ruined period. There was once a monarch named 'The Dragon Emperor', the ruler's vast country, this is an evil monarch, and eventually he died because of his own madness."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This coin is something that he rewards his men with similar medals representing glory. So far, four of the first six dragon coins have no idea of ​​whereabouts, and One of the two was made into a jewelry and became a small toy of a big man. The other one was set in the scepter of a ruler to set off a huge jewel. We refer to the last dragon hard The transaction price, combined with the current currency purchasing power, the price has been listed in the manual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to this, I also revealed a gossip, said to each There is a huge secret hidden in the dragon coin, which has a certain relationship with the disappearing dragon empire. If someone can find the treasure of this emperor, it is no longer a temptation to buy the next country with wealth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World history is basically recorded from the beginning of more than 100 years of AD. There is not much detailed record before, even people don’t know until now. What is the great destruction? Why have there been many brilliant civilizations that have suddenly suffered a devastating blow, and why there is no complete written record before the period of great destruction. Now people's speculations about the big shatter are from some incomplete handwriting, plus some logical conjectures to restore the high civilization that once existed in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of things have been destroyed, but there are also things that have been preserved, and these things have become treasures in people's eyes. It is often reported that the treasures that have been found in a certain place have become rich and enemies, or the treasures that were bought at a large price have been faked, and they cost a lot of money. Nothing found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting price of such a coin is converted into a star, that is more than 61,000 pieces, and the fraction is not counted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use four currencies to settle here, in addition to the national currency and stars, there are two other common local settlement currencies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin gave a brand and quoted 100,000 stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money is not an important thing for him now, it’s just a bunch of numbers, and he’s not willing to take a five-figure price. It is the ladder price of 3,000 blocks that has to be tempered for too long. It is better to lift it to 100,000 in one breath and screen out some people who plan to fish in troubled waters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auctioneer did not expect to enter the theme so quickly, and the auction house would have a simple assessment of the products that participated in the auction before the auction began. What is easy to sell, what might happen, and some measures. Dragon coins are a good thing for them, but they may slap, even if someone is involved in the auction, the price will not be too high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this thing is particularly remarkable. It will be a thing that represents the medal, and it will be something that was destroyed before the emperor. The objects that the big men put in their hands. In the end, the value of this gadget has not been accepted by people. Uncertain historical background and meaning, without any current representativeness, is not an orphan, and there is no proof of the side, the starting price of 60,000 stars is not necessarily acceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, there are people who placards so quickly and push the price to a very high level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the auctioneer preached for a while, no one followed, which made him a little regretful drop hammer, and then the hand was handed over to Doolin. He started playing the silver coin without wearing gloves. If he had some knowledge of the world's languages ​​in the dream, including hieroglyphics, he would have found out from the chaotic patterns that it was actually a text, and the meaning was simple and simple. --lucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a lucky coin, not a dragon coin, not a precious piece of art held by the emperor, but it is also invaluable, but no one knows what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what it is for?", Natiya looked curiously at the coin in Du Lin’s hand, and she started to understand Du Lin. This is a person who can't afford to be early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This auction invited Du Lin, purely a formalism, Du Lin came to participate, that is to watch a lively, but he took the initiative to participate in the auction, Explain that he is very optimistic about this thing, or know what it is for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and smiled and shook his head and put the coin in his pocket. If there are big people in the field of antiques, I am afraid that the chance that Du Lin will want to buy some treasures in the future will be low and horrible, because he does not care for antiques. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just feel that there is an eye, look at it, buy it, there may not be a reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is not Du Lin, at least Natiya thinks so. Dooling is not willing to continue to go deep into this issue, and she will not be boring. Then Du Lin bought a piece of jewelry with precious "bloodliness", not a royal collection, or a royal palace. These things are very good for sending people later. The price is not expensive, there is enough historical back, under the support of this background, the money is not money, it is a fragrant banknote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President of the Republic of Tolivia privately sent some of Doolin’s artworks, precious works of art, but it was printed as a print. Du Lin, the reason is very simple. Du Lin just signed a big contract with them for “own money”. The Republic of Tolivia has just achieved republicanism and has come out of the split state for a few years. At this time, it has received large international orders for the whole country. The whole society is an exciting piece of good news. In addition to economic gains, the government's authority in society has also increased a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least people will be more convinced that the current government is meaningful and beneficial to society as a whole, and will continue to support the current government. Then some art works that are not able to enhance national strength for such a "small and ridiculous country" are not as good as those sent to Doolin. Later, it is not allowed to have other good projects to cooperate. Throughout the gift process, except for the curator of the National Art Museum of the Republic of Tolivia who has been watching Du Lin with hostility, everything is very complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
