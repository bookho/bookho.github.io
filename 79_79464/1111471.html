At first, many people didn't know what this sentence meant. They even vaguely felt that they had heard of the name Doolin. When they couldn't help but curious to ask questions, there would always be some enthusiastic and patient encyclopedias for them. What is the science of Doolin, why Du Lin is a great hero, and he has valuable knowledge from where he came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, some people have realized that this may be a kind of... well, alternative propaganda, don’t take these words as one thing, There are also some more popular people who are beginning to care about this matter. In any case, Doolin did what all the imperial people wanted to do. He used another way to let the federation know the great power from the empire and had a disastrous consequences. In addition to the current situation and the trend of public opinion, many people have begun to pay attention to Du Lin’s whereabouts and his news outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s still some passionate and patient people who often sit down and discuss how dangerous and chasing Du Lin has experienced, destroying the vicious plot, the plot climax It’s fascinating and has recently joined the plot of the adventure. The things he “experienced” can almost be combined to write a series of books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very naive move in the eyes of some people, but don’t forget that in this society, 99% of the people are so-called childish In the midst of growth, especially now that the Empire and the Commonwealth are still in a state of war, both the state and the society, as well as individuals, need some special models to appear in front of the people. This will set a good example and be inspiring and inspiring. Throughout history, whenever an important turning point occurs in a country, heroism will begin to blaze, and all kinds of industries, all walks of life will have an endless stream of heroes, leading everyone to victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just played one of the roles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weekend, in mid-February, less than four months outside, Du Lin, who visited 13 countries, finally returned. When he came down from the naval warship he was riding, the harbor was crowded with people who came to watch. The cheering cheers and the colorful ribbons are like grand festivals. People who don’t know think that they are going to have a holiday today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the girls holding flowers and the crowds of passion, Du Lin continued to wave with them. Dufu stood behind Du Lin and whispered, "How much did you spend so many people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya standing on the side I couldn't help but smile, then quickly closed my mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin squinted at him sideways, his lips moving slightly. "I didn't do that at all. I am a hero, understand? One Yingying, Xiyiong Male, hero. People love my love is from the heart, do you need me to spend money?" After a while, he suddenly said, "About 200,000, this money is worth it!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and took the bouquet from a girl who was only 13 or 14 years old. She also shook hands with the little girl very seriously, and the little girl was covered with a red tip. Cry it up and then pour it backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is deducting money, acting is too exaggerated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya quickly took out small The book put this record up. In short, she is now the most important secretary around Du Lin, assisting Du Lin to handle a lot of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, 200,000 people can’t change the crowd, and the cost of real expenses is more than 200,000. The public opinion propaganda in the whole society is definitely not a small number. There are not millions of people who can't do everything well. This money is so valuable that it appears like this. Only one-tenth or less of the entire port was hired by Doolin, and the rest were curious people who spontaneously came to see Du Lin’s heroes. But under the group's herd effect, once the fanatical atmosphere began to spread, like a man who stood in front of the urinal and pulled the zipper, the stop could not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a podium on the port, which Dulin specifically arranged, of course, he can not say so. This podium was spontaneously arranged by a business owner. He is also one of Doolin’s fanatics and wants Doolin to say a few words to everyone. In the absence of resignation, Du Linyi stood on the podium for his difficulties. He smiled with a smile and began to calm down and spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrangement of the speakers is very good and very numerous, ensuring that the entire port can hear his voice and can see his figure in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always maintains a special smile, grinning and laughing twice. Without any language, it’s two laughs, but it also caused the people on the crowd to be happy. The laughter is like a happy ocean full of erosion. Although many people don’t understand what is happy, But I also laughed inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand again and the port was quiet again. After a moment of discretion, he said, "I am very glad that this time I didn't lose my face to the empire..." He waved his fist and his voice improved slightly. "Yes, Guys, I won!", he waved his finger to the direction of the federation. "I let them not even wear their trousers. They plundered our twenty years of wealth. I let them in a month, The economy has gone backwards for 20 years! They owe us, I let them back, and put them under their feet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that the church wants to give me "Is the medal awarded?", he suddenly throws a question. Some people are very vocal. He smiled and said, "I think it should be issued by the cabinet. I read a newspaper when I was outside. It is said that the federal time. Because there are thousands or even more people jumping off the bank in bankruptcy, is this a meritorious service? I killed them?" He gestured a shot, and some people think it is such a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a little bit of noise, Du Lin continued, "I will come back with victory, I will see another victory. Honestly, I I made a little money, but I don't think it's great. Because I am an imperial person, I love this country and love all the empires like me. I heard that the federal government called Sail donated I have a lot of money for the country. I am not as great as him. But I am as passionate about my country as he is. I donate 10 million to the Ministry of National Defense and congratulate the war victory in advance!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will win, the empire will win!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The port boiled for a moment, Du Lin waved his hand and walked down the podium, all the way Shaking hands and talking with the enthusiastic people on both sides and the spontaneous enthusiastic people, while walking towards the roadside team. He can feel that this effort is valuable. In the past, even if people knew who he was and what he did, there would be no inexplicable fanaticism like this. Du Lin has not been accepted by the mainstream group for two reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is because of his ethnicity and the trend of ethnic integration. Today’s mainstream society still has some inexplicable superiority to ethnic minorities. They will not admit your success and will only regard the success of others as a manifestation of luck. This is one of the reasons why Dooling has not been able to recruit real top talents for a long time. Those who really have the ability to be proud, and those who want to pursue progress are not looking at him, even if he is very rich now, very entitled, very There is status, but these people are more or less unwilling to serve him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that he has been packaging himself into a small number of representatives in public opinion. This has advantages and disadvantages. The good thing is to protect him in the early days of his development. People are always full of pity for the weak, because they put themselves in the position of the strong, which will make people pay attention to him or care about his infringement. But the bad side is that his minority is clearly separated from the whole society, which is not conducive to subsequent development. What he is doing now is also making up for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time with a victory back, plus his day and night publicity propaganda, finally filled in the last short board - this is only the public, in fact He was still not accepted at the top of the social tower, because he was always a farmer with mud dogs, and even if there were nobles serving him, it would not be enough to make up for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a round of return, Du Lin can start thinking about his lifelong events and sell himself for a good price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last...Magus said that the royal family still has a princess? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good choice, the royal family has been hidden behind the scenes, there is not much power in the hands, the cabinet is also very alert to the expansion of royal power, will not give them a restoration This is a good thing. Don't worry too much about becoming a royal nourishment, and at the same time, with your own social foundation, be careful not to ask a little. Of course, this is not the most important thing. The important thing is that he has to pursue the victory and maximize the use of the current advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news that Du Lin came back soon spread in the entire empire. People who were not so concerned about Du Lin now have a little interest in him, especially Du After Lin boarded the TV station's political program, he explained in detail what he did in the Federation, an empire dream successor, a hero who subverted the national economy with personal strength, even the royal family. The college sent invitations and wanted to invite him to take a class for the students of the School of Economics and talk about some issues in the modern economy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit too much, even if it is a very glorious thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, an unexpected person contacted Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to say congratulations, your voice is too big recently, someone is talking about you." The other end of the phone is Harry, the bastard and Du Lin had not been in contact for a while. Before leaving the empire, Harry was in some trouble. He could be assigned to the field of duty crimes. Several agents chased him and made him nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
