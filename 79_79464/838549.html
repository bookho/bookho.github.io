			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two started talking about the business after they had finished talking about business. They didn’t have any burdens and said things that no one knows, and one is the secret of the federation. For a moment, it was the news of the East. Mr. Jack’s knowledge was very profound. When he was chatting with him, Du Lin felt very interesting. Perhaps because of the influence of the dream, he was somewhat sensitive to the word of the East and could not help but ask about the news about the East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the empire had already had contact with the East more than 170 years ago, but at that time the war was anxious, the provincial dynasty and the kingdom of Guart There was no war in the war between the kingdoms of Yaoxing, and the visit of the Eastern Mission was directly left. Later, the other party came again twice. Every time it came, it was always a war period. The continuous war made the East think that the West was a arrogant country, so it broke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, the empire eliminated the provincial dynasty and the guarite kingdom, realizing partial reunification, and the southern unremarkable business alliance established a national, north-south confrontation. There are also frequent conflicts between the two sides. Under such circumstances, the empire and the federation did not send a mission to contact the other Orientals who might be in the other world. On the one hand, because of the lack of navigation technology, no one dared to guarantee the sea before they knew how far the other party was. Can come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the empire and the federal energy are placed on each other, and there is no time and financial resources to support the large-scale voyage. So the matter dragged down. Instead, merchants, smugglers, slave traders and fugitives began their journey to explore the eastern world. No matter what purpose they want to get, they found the Eastern Continent and brought back some beautiful and special products. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mouth of these people, the East is a very interesting place, their systems and civilizations are obviously not the same here, so many people are facing the mysterious East. Full of curiosity. If the journey is not too far away, there are too many problems on the road, and perhaps everyone has already begun to explore the world of the East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were chatting happily, and suddenly Thomson knocked on the door and got Dorin’s permission and walked in. He was a little embarrassed to pay tribute to Mr. Jack. He didn't know this person, but the mayor could take the opportunity to entertain the distinguished guest here. Obviously the identity or status of the other party is very special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Jack is my friend and will be my important partner in the future. He can and knows anything about the city." "Du Lin used a word, this city, this is to remind Thomson if it has nothing to do with business, when it is private." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Jack also heard the meaning of Dooling. He didn't feel anything wrong. He smiled and nodded slightly to Du Lin, then looked at Thomson. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Thomson moved her lips, and said only: "city center there's a problem on the site, some people stop us bulldozed land." <br /> < Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Linyi, Mr. Jack frowned first, only half-jokingly said to Du Lin: "I didn't expect anyone in your city to give you a face, these It’s a little scary to be courageous.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sentence is indeed a joke, but behind the jokes, I also intentionally reminded Du Lin, you have to Get these people done, or people will question your control over the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also reacted. When he stood up, Mr. Jack also stood up. Du Lin knew what he meant, and there was no objection. Go outside the door. Soon, the two cars rushed toward the city center in the dust on the road. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Turin take the car from 纳米林德斯 people over there just to mention the morning only to Otis, it is not a luxury car, ordinary 10,000 yuan in the early days, it is a good car for ordinary people. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; when there is some distance away from the city center of Turin saw the two AT-1 parked in the street, next to a large group of people around. These people looked very excited, and there was also an old man who used his cane in his hand to beat a mechanical leg a few times thicker than his entire body, constantly pushing and pushing the operators. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; AT-1 belongs to carry weapons platform, in appearance like a six-legged crab, twelve meters high from the ground, can be equipped with four field Guns or sixteen large-caliber guns can also be equipped with a fully woven warning tactical bastion. At present, the AT-1 is in a semi-retired state. This mature weapon-equipped platform has many problems in the war. The AT-3 weapon-equipped platform has been installed, and soon the entire Army will eliminate the AT-1. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; AT-1 performance and all of the outstanding performance really had some bright spots, in order to suppress the country's extreme nationalist organizations and rostrum resistance forces, as well as federal Formed a force deterrent, produced a large number of weapons equipped platform of this model, so that there was a little accident in the dress-up - for example, there are almost 140,000 units of AT-1 in the warehouse did not move Yes, and they are all new. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a huge waste has caused many patriots to put forward a lot of very "moderate" views. Finally, at the request of Magus, the original manufacturer of AT-1 must make a matching engineering street junction, let this War weapons have become construction machinery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of Du Lin’s here are still sent to him by Governor Harry, just to help him complete the city’s transformation as soon as possible, and then there will be about five or six The frame arrived at Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original purpose of these machines was to serve the war, so they are faster, more stable, and more powerful than ordinary construction machinery. A house can be dismantled into a pile of ruins in just ten minutes. In particular, this modification allows each AT-1 to be multi-threaded, while four operators operate four huge engineering arms, which is far more efficient. For general construction machinery. It is for this reason that the Empire closed down a large number of mechanical production plants in the past two years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the people around the two construction machinery to prevent them from functioning, and also aggressive to the driving operator, Du Lin brow slightly, opened the door Go on. Before he closed the door, he lowered his head and shouted: "Crash!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomson sitting in the co-pilot almost picked up, what to open Jokes, there will be death and injury when the intensive crowd hits the past, but he can't guarantee that the driver will really listen to the mayor's words, so he immediately said "I am going down" and pushed the door and got off the bus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin walked over to Mr. Jack’s car and opened the door and sat in. He told the driver, “Come around and make two turns.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver did not ask Mr. Jack what he meant and started the car directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way is a bit savage!", Mr. Jack said with a slap in the face, but he quickly laughed, "but useful!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a very smart person, or he can’t sit in the current position, if Doolin goes as the mayor and the group looks very excited The public can solve this problem by means of negotiation, which may not be useful for one month or even one year. Sometimes people sometimes oppose what they need because they need it, but they oppose it. Negotiating with these people will not have any gains other than anger, but the other party may be very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way is to first disperse this group of people, not let them unite together to produce group effects, and then find the key people from them to "talk" them, and the next thing will naturally be solved. In fact, this means is nothing more than differentiation, coercion, and lure. It can be said that people have been playing badly, but this trick is still the most useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jack also thought about how to solve such a problem, but did not think that Du Lin could use the most direct in the shortest time. means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, all successful people can’t be underestimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha ordered a cigarette and took a bottle of wine from the co-pilot's storage box and drenched it on himself. He took two cigarettes deep, collected the ash in his palm, and poured a little wine on his face. Then he looked at the group carefully, looking for a few guys in the crowd who seemed to be the leader, stepping on the pedals of the power cabin, and the car xiu slammed out slightly, like a sharp arrow from the string. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the speed of this car is full, it is forty yards, but in this era, this period is already a very fast car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes someone found that the car coming from afar didn’t seem to be slowing down. Some people panicked and ran away, but some people reacted a little slower. A little, staying in place... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly appointed police chief, Hite, was already in a few minutes after riding the Malay. He just glanced at the ground and seemed drunk. Then, a face of mud and gray Buddha, told the police officer behind him to bring this guy back, and then began to deal with the accident. An old man and two young people were knocked down because they couldn't dodge. It seems that the oldest person is the oldest. After all, the old age reaction and physical skills have already declined. He is the most practical one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One leg is bloody, and the mourning is on the ground. The other two young people are not a big problem, just a bruise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hite made the old man carry it to the horse immediately, and then ordered him to go to the hospital - only the nurse had no doctor's hospital, and then began to deal with the accident here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at the people around him, took out a small book and a pen and asked: "Whoever let you gather here, who is Convener and responsible person?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
