			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ms. Chris, I know the financial strength of the George family and I understand your determination, but I don’t think that I want to cooperate. A stupid and ridiculous proposal.", when Du Lin said this sentence, what Chris wanted to say, but was stopped by Doolin. "Perhaps in your eyes, the George family can do anything, no one can Block your progress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But in my opinion, you are rushing into a new industry and have caused extreme problems for practitioners in this industry. Serious impact, if all the people who do the theater are united, do you think the George family can overcome the whole industry? I think it is impossible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You need helpers, but also someone needs to share the pressure for you, and complete the layout of the entire industry faster. I, Juan, have a lot of theaters in hand, if we can become partners, George family The layout plan can be at least half a year ahead of schedule. The money is not important to you, the prestige status is not important to you, but time is very important!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is more than half a year for you to do more There are many things, not for more than half a year. In order to protect ourselves, we always have to be together and eventually form a horrible giant..." Du Lin said suddenly when he came here, "Cray Ms. Silk, have you heard of the cinema union? It may not be available yet, but it may not be in the future!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin said the word union At the time, Chris's face changed rapidly. The initial birth of the trade union was that the working class spontaneously formed a special non-profit social organization in order to protect its own interests. The main duty was to protect the rights of workers from illegal infringement by capitalists. Trade unions may be like that in the eyes of most people. However, in the eyes of senior officials, trade union organizations are the most powerful means of countering the rapid expansion of capitalist capitalism, and the “forced war” between trade unions and capitalists often wins. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this stage, it is difficult to have an emerging field or industry fully controlled by a certain family or consortium because of the existence of a trade union organization. For example, the actor strikes that broke out some time ago, and the actor union that was established later, is a kind of war on the bottom of the low-class society that over-intervenes the capitalists in the film industry, and is a victorious war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it’s not right, then everyone has no food to eat. Anyway, most of the unions are the lowest-ranking actors, and they often don’t have jobs. Even if there is, there is only a modest salary. The impact of the strike on their life and work is not great. It is precisely because these low-level actors strike, making it difficult for many movies to continue shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true for theaters. Large and small theaters feel the high-pressure threat from the George family. If they form a union, the George family will fall into the passive. Especially in this trade union there may be a group of rich people like Doolin and Juan, then this will have a devastating blow to the George family's plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, the means of monopolizing an industry is nothing more than continually annexing and pursuing the industry as pure as possible, if there is only George in the field of cinema lines. One, then this is a monopoly. But if there is a large group of cinemas in this industry that unite and have more theaters than the George family, this is not a monopoly. Without monopoly, there will be no huge profits, and there will be no right to speak that no one can resist. There will be no enough political benefits! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if Doolin, Juan, and other rich people with many resources in their hands become partners of the George family, even if they work together, even those theaters It would be pointless to set up a trade union. There is no problem when the number of players can be crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crisis did not immediately answer Du Lin, this is not something she can do, she can be responsible for Irian and the surrounding things, but can not be responsible for the whole The family's layout and planning of the theater, she needs to report the news of Doolin to the core members of the family. Even if it is a core member of the family, facing this problem will require an extended discussion before giving an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of Chris is very obvious, Du Lin has closed his mouth, his purpose has been reached, and there is nothing to say next. Chris got up and sent Du Lin to the door. When she said the scene, Du Lin turned and saw Nasha standing behind her. He snorted and then nodded and circumvented Miss Nasha from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Du Lin disappeared into the elevator, Nasha took his eyes back from the closed elevator door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is that person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris is really a bit surprised, this is Na After Shah came to Irian for the first time, she voluntarily asked about a local person's information. She didn't know where Dulin had attracted Miss Nasha, but as the secretary of Miss Nasha, she had to answer this question. forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin?", Nasha recalled some doubts. She didn't have any special impression on the name, but she always felt like she was listening to somewhere. After that voice, "What is he doing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris had already been surprised. She ushered Miss Nasha into the suite and prepared a cup of coffee for her. "Mr. Doolin came here to discuss cooperation with the family. He said that he has a hand in his hand. Certain resources, I hope that we can achieve mutual benefit with us. I have no way to answer Mr. Du Lin immediately and intend to report this matter to Mr. President."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Check this person, I think he should know something that I am interested in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Miss Nasha’s request, Chris has no room for rebuttal, Besides, is it not a simple matter for the George family to check a person? It’s just that Chris is a bit curious. Since Missy’s return, there has been no such concern for other people as it is today. She left a mind and prepared to report this incident to Mr. President, perhaps for other uses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is going on in an orderly manner. Two days later, the moment passed, and Du Lin also welcomed the two people that Kevin introduced to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lawyer who is also very famous in the Imperial City, but because he has encountered two difficult cases in two consecutive cases, he does not meet the requirements of the employer, he needs a temporary rest a period of time. For these lawyers, the winning rate and recent performance are two important indexes. Lawyers like Kevin who can maintain a 100% chance of winning are very rare. At the level of Kevin, his selection of the agent was exceptionally rigorous. He would not accept any case that might break his golden body, no matter how much the other party gave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another financial agent from the Imperial Capital came to Doolin here mainly for a comeback. This guy named Joshua is notoriously in jail. He worked with a person to collect money for money. Finally, he was betrayed by his companions, served as a scapegoat for five years and confiscated all the property. The most terrible thing is that what he did was known to Xie Lisi Street. Some of the tycoons on Xie Lisi Street have already released their words and forbid anyone to cooperate with Joshua. He can only contact some old friends after he has nowhere to go, and finally he will take this line of Doolin through Kevin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin hosted two people in the most luxurious restaurant in Irian, filled an entire table with expensive dishes, and opened two bottles worth hundreds of pieces. Precious red wine. Everyone was very satisfied with this meal. Du Lin expressed his respect for the two and showed his financial strength. Not everyone can eat seven or eight hundred for a meal, which is more than the ordinary rich level. After the meal, the three returned to the estate of Doolin. After a short break, he invited the two into his study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
