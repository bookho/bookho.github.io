			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin is not very willing to marry Su Rui, after all, there have been some episodes during the two people, which makes Merlin somewhat resentful. Especially the change of Su Rui before and after seeing Du Lin that day was really a bit too big. I was impatient at the moment, but the next moment became humble. I am afraid that no one would like to have such a girlfriend unless they are true love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, between Merlin and Surrey..., maybe only a physical relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't want to marry Su Rui, but Suri is pregnant, so he has to find someone to discuss how to do this. In the family controlled by the traditional Mr. Xmas, there are always some traditional stereotypes that are instilled in the children, one of which is called responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Doolin is an exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing, actually, Du Lin is not too good to intervene, after all, he has little relationship with him from beginning to end, but he also needs to take some responsibility, the original suggestion It is him who has been with Su Rui, and this is the main reason leading to Suri's pregnancy. If Merlin directly took Suri away, I am afraid there would not be so many things. So he does have some responsibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't like her at all? Even if it's just a little!", Du Lin's thumb is stuck on the inside of the fingernail's nail, revealing hair. A little bit of nails, "You have to tell the truth, don't need to think about anything else in front of me, remember what we are?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin looked Du Lin couldn't help but smile, "Border Stone Three Brothers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin made a punch on his shoulder, yes, Jieshi San Brothers . In the battles between the Xerma family and the next-door family, the vast majority of fuses are the boundary stones that can be blown away by the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the country, it is difficult to distinguish the land from the endless fields, who is the land, so everyone uses some heavy stones. It is used as the dividing line of the field, and then placed in the middle of the land of different ownership to distinguish the ownership of each farmland. This stone used to divide the area is called the boundary stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason, Merlin and Doolin's three little guys have secretly moved the boundary stone to other people's sites, and then moved a little. When the harvest season was over, the battle broke out. As a multi-ethnic and highly competitive Kemma family, you can always win in battle and harvest more "a little" crops every year than others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They claim to be "Border Stone Three Brothers" and fight for territory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembering the stupid things that Dud and Merlin did when they were young, they couldn’t help but laugh out. The innocent talent is the stupidest, but stupidly cute. . When people lose their innocence, the first thing to learn is to think, thinking is a good thing, because thinking will tell everyone what he should do is the most correct. And this will also make people lose the opportunity to do stupid things, which is called maturity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't like it at all...", Merlin grabbed his head. "How much is still a little bit of feeling. After all, she is my first woman. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin couldn't help but ask: "Isn't it a peek?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Why do you want to say this again?!” Merlin’s serious attitude was instantly dispelled by Du Lin. When they were young, they peeked at a widow’s bath in the town – the widow’s husband was attacked by a group of coyotes while farming. When people found him with a weapon, he had only half a bone shelf left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Merlin said that I will marry this woman when I grow up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, a widow, twenty-eight-nine-year-old, is the age at which it fades to a mature age. Every time the three little-necked children saw the widow drowning at home, they sneaked into the tree behind her yard and peeked. Later, Mason and Doolin felt that there was no meaning, but there was less, but Merlin. But always go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin asked half-jokingly: "You won't still like that widow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; When this sentence came out, Merlin fell into silence. Du Lin couldn’t help but slap on his forehead. The widow was already forty years old this year, and her body began to look away. To the ripe peach, there may be only a little bloated pumpkin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like her in the past, not her now!", Merlin felt it necessary to explain, "We said that we will not mention this matter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Du Lin slightly calmed Merlin, who was once again smashed in the black history. He asked very seriously: "I don't say it, I swear... then you just have to tell me one thing, you are not exactly with Su Rui." Can't you go on? Or what did she do to make you unable to accept her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glared at Merlin’s shoulder and asked, “Do you remember what I said to you? Suri is a very simple woman, she is pursuing a rich material life, and Higher social status. She can take the initiative to conceive in order to pursue these things, then she will try her best to indulge and forgive you in order to maintain this life, to fight for your embarrassment."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are willing to let me choose instead of you, I will let you This woman, then what do you love to do, as long as there is no other woman who can threaten her status, then everything in your life will be the way you want!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I can't make any choices for you, you can also marry her, I can't afford to give her a breakup fee, then you go find a woman you like. Talk to her about a possible It takes a long time to fall in love, and then I will be alive and dead by love. After I get married, I need to look at her face. Every day when you go home, she will check if there are any traces left by other women. Every day, when you go out, she will Carefully ask your itinerary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the love that you think belongs to you, you will lose all initiative, you will become love Slave, because you choose love, you must suffer for love."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe someday, suddenly you find yourself tired, have gone Moved, but you must Hold on, because this is the road you have chosen and gone for a long time, you have no power to turn back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin looked at Doolin and said slowly: "You Here I am a woman I don't really like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am teaching the true meaning of your life!", Du Lin immediately retorted, He patted Merlin's shoulder and stood up. "How to choose your own decision, as long as you remember that we are brothers." If you have something that cannot be solved, tell me, I will help you solve it! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin walked out of the VIP room, she saw Su Rui at a glance. She smiled at Du Lin sweetly and gently stroked her hand on her stomach. Dooling also smiled at her. If nothing else, this woman is likely to become his brother's wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where have you been?", Harry ran away and ran back, followed by the young man next to Fei Lijia. "I can't find it everywhere." To you!", he breathed a sigh of relief, introduced to Du Lin<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the young people around him, "This is Vitor, Princess Felicia Accompanied by the fact that when Miss Felicia is an adult, he will become the manager of this family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Du Lin, Otis The mayor of the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded his hand and said hello, but Vitor did not seem to shake hands," There is no need to do these complicated social rituals. I have a question to ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitor’s tone is a bit harsh, and Du Lin seems to care. I took back my hand and said "please say". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Felica stayed in Otis for four days, how did you arrange for the next three days, road map and schedule for me? In addition, I think your security power is still weak, and you should strengthen the strength and depth of defense. Also, considering that the food is not too far from the South, I hope that for the next three days, lunch and dinner will be needed. At least no less than five different non-repeating seafood dishes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitol bibibibi said a lot of things, these things are meticulously in the bathroom The paper used has strict standards. Du Lin glanced at Harry. Harry listened very seriously and nodded from time to time. It seemed that he did not feel that this was a difficult performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Vitor looked at Du Lin after he finished speaking, Du Lin shrugged his shoulders. "Sorry, Mr. Vittor, what you said." None of them. If you or your host have a need, you can prepare it yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitor frowned and looked at Harry, Harry was The biggest one here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry seems to have a very graceful smile. In fact, the skull has already hurt. He can’t wait to disappear right now. "Du Lin, these things... ...you are not prepared? If other things are not prepared, it doesn't matter, but the itinerary arrangement..." In fact, Harry is already very helpful in saving the field, even if Du Lin casually compiles something, he also Can make a difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
