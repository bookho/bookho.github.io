			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter walked into the study, took off his coat, and lay on his back on the sofa. He closed his eyes and the latest things in his mind were constantly tumbling, giving him some heart and soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The part of the money that he handed in every month after Wood’s death is temporarily missing, and the death of Gordo gave the mayor’s heart a feeling of subtlety. . I don't know when it started, some things have gradually lost control, which is definitely not a good sign for rule makers like him. What's more important is that when this is something that makes him unable to understand, the State Taxation Bureau sent an investigator to Ternair to check the tax. It is hard to say whether there is any connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Vivienne’s sudden pregnancy, a mess of numbness made him scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't the lady attempt to leave the manor these days?", the mayor's eyes closed and enjoyed a rare leisure time after busy and intense work. The average person may have collapsed under such pressure, but Peter is very enjoyable. He is a person who pursues power, from the very beginning, and now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler helped the mayor to organize his coat and hang it up, replied: "So far, the lady has not left the room, only eaten very much There are few things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Someone come to see her?", Mrs. Vivian has a lot of handkerchiefs, these handkerchiefs are the ladies in the city. Their husbands are not the staff of this empire, but the ambitious tycoon in the city of Tener. The communication of men is always inseparable from the adjustment of social flowers, so not everyone has enough energy to return home, which makes the city's largest circle of ladies a bit confusing,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivienne is the number one person in the circle of ladies. She has not appeared in the past few days, and it is inevitable that anyone will want to contact her to start activities. These ladies can't be underestimated. This is Peter's accumulated experience over the years. They may not have the ability to do business, but it is definitely a good thing to engage in destruction. Mrs. Vivian's organization of such a tea party is also the result of Peter's instigation and indulgence. When necessary, these women are likely to bring great benefits to him. Even if they are the worst, they will not be inexplicably bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, Yesterday, Mrs. Gegema came to visit, and the wife refused her visit with physical discomfort. No other person has visited or attempted. I have visited the lady." The butler answered the question of Peter with due diligence. It is not easy to be a housekeeper. It is not easy to be a steward of a big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter nodded. "The police at the door, have they left when I came back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was like this, it was a heavy rain today. They were all wet, I let them come in for a while, then the two may have caught a cold. In order to avoid them passing the cold to the people in the manor, I let them rest after a while and then left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do it well!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold is a strange disease, it won't be fierce It will not make people unable to stand and walk, nor will it cause people to lose any function of the body, but a cold will kill people. Those in the church once said that a cold is a punishment that God has lowered, and a judgment of the soul. Every year, many people leave the world to return to the embrace of God because of a cold. The most interesting thing is that poor people can't afford a cold, but most people can always recover. On the contrary, those dignitaries, who use a variety of precious drugs, are always unwilling to close their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone said that because the hearts of the dignitaries are black, God has judged them. This rumor obviously does not have any basis and authenticity. The official also stands. I have come out and blamed, but the big men are convinced of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for the cold, their attitude is to never touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter quickly fell into a deep sleep, so that day after day the work exhausted him, but he was happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two small police officers have taken off the police uniform, and this meeting with Mrs. Vivian has brought great opportunities to Du Lin, but It can also be said that he is facing a bigger crisis. Doolin believes that anyone who encounters the same setbacks will produce antibodies and have the desire to overcome. Some people may admit their lives and be willing to lower their noble heads, but he believes that Mrs. Vivian is not such a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was born in the house of the Governor. She came to the world from a young age with a golden spoon. All the people I contacted were aristocratic politicians, business giants, and her. Perhaps the world itself is like this, until she fell to the ground and took a bite of bitterness and astringent mud, she recognized the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power, wealth, prestige, constitutes this decent world, wants to live a decent, wants everything to be so smooth, depends on others No way. Others may look at you because your husband and your father are high, but after all, they just look at it. In the eyes of these politicians, family members are just flowers that they feel their social responsibility, and it is impossible to change their purpose, or ambition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
