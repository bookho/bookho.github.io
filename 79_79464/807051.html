			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a private place, there is no permission to go in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cart wrinkles are receiving members Frowning, he smiled and said a sorry to a member, then walked outside the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will gather here every Saturday to exchange what happened in the last week, perhaps to discuss some topics of interest. Time seems to never be late, no doubt, Saturday is coming again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapel was built with some people very curious, and even some church people thought it was the church of God, they even wanted to come and pray repent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early empire did not recognize sects other than the church under the influence of the church until later in order to downplay the power and strength of the church in the empire, in the seventh emperor During the period, the old man announced the new imperial law, which advocated religious freedom. The church of the gods of the province, the witch of the barbarians, and the gods of the Irians began to spread. In addition to the remote areas, there are always churches in the bustling cities that are called "pagan" by the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After successively sending a lot of misunderstandings, there was a lot of cleanliness here, and no one thought about praying again. In fact, don't talk about the statues of the first kings and the gods. There are no paintings here. Even if people come in to estimate that they are also confused, they can't tell what the church is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the sound outside, Carter realized that there might be some "bugs" that wanted to break in. When he came out of the church door, he saw it. A few drunkards outside the yard held bottles in their hands and pushed with the members of the fellowship. Perhaps they saw Carter, and the members' actions were a big one. One of them was pushing a drunkard to the ground, and the other drunken people started to attack under the influence of alcohol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a bottle of wine is about to pass, everyone seems to be frozen. Their eyes were locked on the body of the Haus Luwei, which was slowly parked on the side of the road. The silver paint is like a small moon in the dark, reflecting the silvery white moon. This kind of car doesn't say they can't afford it. It's just a car, they probably can't afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wooden attire wearing a formal hat with a domed hat, stunned the drunkards, and drove the car door for Du Lin from the first officer, Du Lin and Dufo’s Dressing is almost the same, both dresses and a hat. He was a little disgusted and glanced at the drunkards under the light who were about to fight, walking straight toward the church. Those drunken people suddenly woke up a lot, and there was a hint of sorrow in the eyes of Du Lin’s back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dudu smoked a cigarette, and when he walked under the light, he put the smoke on his mouth, and looked at the drunkards, his eyes swept over each of them, and then drove directly from the drunkard that raised the bottle. The bottle was taken away, and the cockroach was on the head of the man. Broken glass slag, blood, wine, in an instant is like a sudden blooming flower. Whether it is those members who are guarded outside the church, or those who are drunk with a lot of money to make a lot of money, they are all stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha looked at the soft guy who fell to the ground, took a circle of money from his pocket, and counted five and two pieces at his hand. The drunkard who seems to be in a coma. He didn't even bother to look at it even more, and he followed Doolin again. Just as he was about to enter the church yard, he showed a cold expression to the members of the fellowship who guarded the iron gate. "Remember, the Guartes have no cowards. Either fight or die!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drunkards, you see me, I see you, it seems that the wine has passed. They silently dragged the two arms of the companions on the ground, picked up the ten dollars, and left silently. They can play in the fifth district and the same residents who live here, and they can face the role of being able to afford such a luxury car, even if one hundred together are not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are here!", Carter bent down very respectfully, in fact, from the day he first saw Du Lin, he was not An ordinary Guar, according to the custom of the guar kingdom in the past, Carter is already a vassal of Doolin. He is a private "article" of Doolin. Du Lin can decide his life and death in one sentence. So he was very respectful of Doolin, not only because of his relationship with Doolin, but also because Du Lin gave him the opportunity to enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not Doolin, he doesn’t say that he’s revenge to kill the old bastard, and even he’s likely to be slaughtered by the old bastard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded slightly and stepped into the church. The original noisy church became silent in a moment, leaving only one sole and the floor. The tapping sound when coming into contact. Under the "high-profile", Du Lin went to the support desk. He looked up at the rudimentary church and quickly recovered his gaze. He took the hat off and placed it on the stage. He had a smile on his face and said his name with a very clear bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Others like to call me Mr. 350,000, you can call me Du Lin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;The whole church was silent, and Doolin didn't feel any embarrassment. He understood the mentality and emotions of these people at this time. It was like a mythical story suddenly turned into a real one. Not everyone can be in the first place. Accepted in time. He shrugged his shoulders and continued, "Carter wants me to come once, and I think so. Don't think that I am different from you, we are no different!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a gult, I was not much different from the ones here a year ago. I am from a small city, the first money I got was the errands, I earned myself. The first money is for the rich people to wash the car, they give me the car wash.", Du Lin said these things and the life of the Guarts living in the fifth district does not seem to be much different At the same time, his special angle suddenly caught the hearts of these young people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year ago, he was just a car wash, but a year later, he was already sitting on a manor worth 350,000, driving a luxury car, holding it in his hand A lot of big money. The members who can appear in the church today are not "honest" children. They also want to hear the 350,000 Mr. Du Lin, how to complete the transition from poverty to wealth in a very short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have thought about it, I can make a regular car wash by the money earned by car wash, by the way, I can repair or decorate the car, I will take my The shop is full of the empire. When people see me, they will say to their neighbors, 'Hey, that’s the empire car wash tycoon!'”, he couldn’t help but laugh when he said it, there are some The member smiled and he shook his head. "Ideology is only ideal, it is beautiful, but it is not realistic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My thoughts are very fast I was so bloody that I was tortured by malicious reality. I asked myself why when you found a road that seemed to lead to light, you never walked the last step. I thought for a long time and suddenly understood. Come over, because I don't argue, don't grab, because I haven't learned to resist, I don't do anything but bow down. I ask myself, how do I choose, if I go back to the country to be a farmer, maybe I will never be in this life. What tricks will you encounter, those The crop won't hit me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His self-deprecating and ironic words have resonated with many members, the atmosphere suddenly became warm, and others laughed. Out of the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But!", he pointed a finger at the sky, and the smile on his face gradually turned into seriousness. "I will be willing? I will Willing to use the most precious things in this life, to change the mediocrity?", he is asking himself, and also interrogating the hearts of every member present. He slowly shook his head and spit out a heavy syllable, "No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to be!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then I did something that was not very glorious, and it was illegal, but I didn't get what people told me. The consequences of this, I got status, prestige, wealth, power. What happened to this country in this society? Did they deceive me, weaved a lie to deceive me for more than ten years, or did I fool myself? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that I lied to myself, I told myself that to be a good person in line with social ethics, life will be better!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I tell myself, obey the law, don't do things that the law does not allow, so I will have a perfect life!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I told myself that being honest and alive, there may be things that don't go well in this life, but there will be no regrets!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded his head and looked at the eyes of those people. "Yes, I lied to myself! I have never There are karma, so many people who have done bad things are still at large, so many people who have violated their conscience and morality are still drunk, so many people who are not willing to live an ordinary life are making a feast!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is cheating?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today, you can choose to bow, but you have to remember, if you still have There is hope, and the future, when you head down, you can't see it. There is a saying I want to tell you that it is very simple to be a coward. If you look down on the road under your feet, you will never fall, but if you want to To run, to embrace the bright future and hope, look up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is more terrible than mediocrity, in mediocrity Living in boring, I would rather die in the fire, at least I announced to the world that I tried."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After five days, our first wine I have to leave Irian to go to some places to go to those who still live in the dark. I hoped to send the light. In fact, I hesitated before making this decision. I brought hope to them, but also brought destruction to them. They will shed blood and die because of one of my decisions. Compatriots fall on the road to the future, is it worth it? Is it appropriate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
