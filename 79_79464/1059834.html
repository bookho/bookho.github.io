			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a broad-minded man, a lot of things can be left in the heart, just like the swaying wind, waiting for them to boast their bodies to leave It is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But some things, even a person who is noble and sacred, and extremely tolerant, cannot be relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially like this is not only green, but the dog and men and women are still showing their love in front of themselves, absolutely can not be forgiven! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, Xiu En really wanted to kill the man. He believed that his ex-girlfriend must have had a hard time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to change his current situation, the only thing he can do is to complete the task that the investigation team has given him, and enter the Doolin interest group to find a solution. Obtain evidence that Du Lin was directly involved in the crime and then bring Doolin to justice. With Du Lin's current position, even if she can only get a one percent reward, it is enough to make him a monopoly in a moment, maybe there are millions or even more money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money is only on the one hand, the investigation team promised the position of a police investigation bureau director, no matter what the investigation bureau is from the city, at least he returned to himself In his job position, he has to prove to everyone that the things he has taken away from his cultivation will be able to get back with the benefits! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in the evening, in the 13th floor suite of the Imperial Peace Hotel, Xiu En met Du Lin, and Du Lin also saw Xiu En. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit!", Du Lin pointed to the sofa next to him, he was smoking in his mouth, his legs, his elegant clothes and the people standing around him. The black man set off Du Lin’s current status and power. Du Lin’s understatement made Xien’s heart hurt again, but it was much better than the morning shock. At least he had seen Du Lin’s file. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as a real tramp who fears that his clothes are dirty and the sofa does not dare to sit down. He sits on the sofa from the table. A cigarette was smoked from the cigarette case placed on it, and it was taken deeply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t talk, they were all smoking, and in the smoky environment there seemed to be something called memories that spread between the two. When Xiuen felt that the cigarette butt was a little hot, he smothered the cigarette butts in the ashtray and then looked directly at Du Lin. "I need your help, pull me!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also annihilated the cigarette. He leaned on the sofa and looked at Xiu En. His wolverine appearance seemed to be a personal one, and he could lick him and vomit a thick sip at him, and then swear a bad meal. This is in stark contrast to the repairs in Du Lin’s memory. At that time, the Xi’an was more shrewd and more deceitful? All day pretending to be drunk and dreaming to find an opportunity to open the situation, when he has the power to be angry, want to bring down all the old party officials, his attitude is also very tough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look again today, at this moment, this is a loser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head and let Xiu’s heart cool down, but the next thing made Xiuen feel relieved, "I won't Pull you, I don't have this need, you don't have this power, but I can give you a chance, just see if you can catch it.", Du Lin made people pour two cups of coffee, "I used to give you I have a chance, now I will give you the opportunity." He took out a small card, wrote some words on it, then pressed it on the coffee table and pushed it over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After you're done, contact me again." Du Lin took a sip of the coffee. "Coffee is good. You can leave after drinking." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t face Du Lin, I can’t feel the strength and pressure from him. I thought it was a very simple thing, even thinking Well, after seeing Du Lin, how to convince him, how to bargain, how to demonstrate his value. However, at the moment of Doolin's opening, a huge invisible pressure pressed against him. This kind of pressure is invisible, invisible and inferior, but there is a real existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School took a look at the card on the table, then nodded hard, took a sip of coffee and got up and said goodbye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he left the room and closed the door and stood in the hallway, he actually sweated. He glanced at the closed door, pouted and walked toward the elevator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, Du Lin then ordered, "Continue to stare at him.", a black man was ordered to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no prejudice against the man of Doun, even if the bastard threatened himself before, but it doesn't matter. It was not an easy thing to have a rapid rise in Tener without the help of his grace. Like the mad dog, Xiuen bites the smugglers and causes the price of the wine in the Teier area to rise wildly. There is no goods to sell. Even if there is a constant search for the mad dog, many private drinkers are suffering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a period of time, Du Lin and Xiuen reached a cooperation agreement, Du Lin directly mobilized private wine from the warehouse used by the Bureau of Prohibition to store contraband, and sold it to others. This is a non-existent business. Du Lin was able to get private wine without any capital at the time, and it was the only one that could sell it without being inspected. This allowed him to acquire a lot of wealth and social status in a very short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you don't have is what you have. This is a symbol of social status and power. Whether or not Xiuen had other thoughts on him, Du Lin had to admit this sentiment, so he gave Xiun an opportunity, or a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last time Du Lin and Freena appeared outside the court to increase the exposure for Freina, one thing is bothering Fu Lena, a reporter has been filming her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the three feature artists of the George family was specializing in inferior news. Because of Mr. John’s relationship, many people dare to speak out, after all, Mr. John. However, the monopolist of the newspaper industry knows a lot of big people, and it is possible to ruin a person's future by pouting. At the time, those reporters mainly targeted some of the stars, and also involved some well-known personalities with a certain reputation. Most of them used the method of stealing fear to match the text of Hu Wei to create a news full of inferior taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of news is very marketable, especially when some big stars are exposed, sales are simply exploding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The George House lost its most important pillar after being burned, and was instantly dismembered by the capitalists, some journalists and editors who specialize in inferior news. Emperor has set up a brand new newspaper. This newspaper has never reported any major events in the country. It has been staring at the stars and celebrities all day, what is out of the way, what is the peach trade, what dew point sneak shots, and the wind and water. Many people hate this newspaper called "Imperial Night", and some people sue them, but some people like this newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the more than two years now, Empire Night has publicly apologized no less than a hundred times, and the indemnity has reached more than 200 times, but they still enjoy it. - Because it can bring a considerable degree of profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color of the empire has now changed from a newspaper to a weekly magazine, with a weekly circulation of one million copies, sold throughout the country, and the scale has gradually grown, not at all Some star celebrities are suing. Isn't it a public apology and then compensation for certain economic compensation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first and second pages of this magazine often have a collective apology, including the chief editor, editor-in-chief, and journalist, including the president, who are very sincere apologies and accompanied by an apology full of regrets. But from the third page, it is still a variety of exposures and fabricated content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some stars quickly realized the benefits of such exposure, and even actively cooperated with the color of the empire to expose the publicity, what a certain star bath was photographed, what is certain The star is actually based on the basics. Crazy sales have brought crazy exposure, and some second- and third-line and even first-line stars are crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there is an empire-colored reporter who has been talking to Freena, who has enough topics, the first empire of colored movies. The heroine, who is also the most influential actress in the history of the imperial film, and perhaps the female star who was sponsored by Doolin, was able to put her news photos on the weekly magazine, and her fans were snapped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena said this to Du Lin last time. Du Lin’s attitude is to protect himself, and the rest do not care. Now Du Lin is not suitable for shooting, and it is meaningless to sue those people. They apologize while doing their own thing and have become a cancer in the press. This time, Xiu En wants to take the lead and just entrust this to him and let him do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xu En He can’t figure out what Du Lin’s fall on is, only one person’s name is written on the paper, and there is no more than that. information. This is not to say that as evidence of Dorian’s accusation, there is no qualification to become evidence. The lawyers were able to find 10 million reasons to prove that the paper and the name on the paper were meaningless and could even bite the investigation team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night, a drunken tramp returned to the park, lying in a place not far from Schöne. He whispered the meaning of the name Xien and his own conjecture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This reporter has been harassing Freena for this time, I think Du Lin means to let him disappear."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a tight mind, and turned over, "I want to kill him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come you have this "Thoughts?", the agent disguised as a tramp sighed, "Just let him not continue to harass Freena, even if you kill him, we can't use this to accuse Du Lin, he didn't give it to you. Any order gives you only one card, and even in the court he can be successfully offended."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
