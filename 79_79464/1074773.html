			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Doolin also planned to disgust about Kellermen and Mr. Keller. The most feared thing like this political hacker is that he has lost his neutral position if he performs. Out of the federal position, then the empire here is not just a matter of abandoning him. He has been exposed to a lot of high-level information in the empire for so long, and he has gained the trust of many big people, but he has failed these trusts. It is obvious that the big men will not let him continue to live and become the "emperor state advisor" of the federal side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only will he die, but all those who have a close relationship with him will be liquidated to ensure that Mr. Kaile will not return to the Union and will not stay Any valuable information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This top political hacker is actually very poor, because from the first day they enter this line, they can no longer dominate their will, must Follow the high-level will of the two countries and the international situation to make active adjustments and cooperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Du Lin didn’t think that Mr. Kaile was very interested in not only putting those young people who didn’t know social responsibility with Du Lin’s social responsibility, but also gave up. All rights and interests related to the law occurred in the conflict. This is very good, he is releasing a signal, telling Du Lin that he is not willing to be an enemy of Doolin, but also telling Doolin that this matter has nothing to do with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point is also very clear, and it is related to the people of the Imperial Bank and the Southern Commercial Bank. Since Mr. Kaile is a very interesting person, then Du Lin doesn't mind finding a chance to sit down with Mr. Keller and talk about it. He may go to the federal side around the beginning of next year to plan a big plan for three years. This time, Mr. Kaile's help is needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has too many stains, especially the stains he left in the early days, that is, criminal records. The criminal record is a glory medal for the real gang, as the assistant director Ke Ge said, being imprisoned is not a shame for the gang, it is a learning act. The reason for this result was that twenty-three years ago, a very special gang leader was sent to prison by someone as a bargaining chip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His popularity in the folks is very good, not like the gangs now, people respect him very much. He performed very well during his prison sentence. He not only helped the prison party to rehabilitate many prisoners, but also learned the culture himself, read many books, and published a short personal collection. When he came out, there were a lot of reporters interviewing him. At that time, he was released as the biggest gang leader in a certain area, and with some tragic effects carried by him, he was very popular among journalists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reporters asked him, as a gang leader, he was imprisoned and was held in jail. What changes in your mind? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He replied calmly: I feel better about myself, I have read and written in it, reading a lot of books. I also believed in the Lord of Heaven, and now I am also a devout believer. If you ask me what I got in this matter, I feel that the whole person has been sublimated. This time of imprisonment is like those students who have been admitted to a good school and completed the most important training in their life, and this is my training! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is widely spread and is regarded as a famous saying by gangs. Many fanatical gangs are proud of being in jail, and even some arrested criminals are willing to Spend money on another prison, living in a cell where the man who had been given a very honorable title such as "Law" before the name. It was a sacred place for gangs, and people were proud of the traces of the leader there, even though he had been hanged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragic characters always have a tragic ending, otherwise it will not shake people's hearts, this guy who has the title of "Law" before the name, Finally, because some things became a bargaining chip, they were hanged on the execution platform in a certain place in the south. When the square was surrounded by the onlookers, silently watching the guy who was like a hero in many people's minds was put on a noose, and there seemed to be something else in the heart except for the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, he looked at the crowd of people in the square and laughed loudly. "I want to get my ca[This word only sends out The previous syllable]......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The execution officer promoted the organ, and the organs under his feet suddenly opened, hanging fifty pounds of heavy objects to his body A squat down and cut his neck. No one knows what he wants to say so far. Many people speculate whether he is repenting. Of course, some people think that he wants to convey some special information. Unfortunately, the executive officer pushed the handle of the organ too fast, and did not give him Sufficient time to speak out has become a mystery that can never be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Du Lin has surpassed the leader in any sense, but Du Lin is not a gang, he is the organizer of a civil organization, and This organization has some exclusions, so people don't use the word "work" in front of Du Lin's name. For example, Lauder Doolin, it sounds awkward, and it is a good thing not to give him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this also made Du Lin's entry and exit become a big problem. Now he and the cabinet, precisely, and Magus are still in the honeymoon period, so he can go out smoothly. Once you have spent the honeymoon period with Magus, it is very difficult to leave the country. The same issue of immigration, like him, is "famous", and perhaps more people who want to enter the country with a messy image want to enter the federation, 99% are not allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every country welcomes the entry of all kinds of talents, even if it is not a talent, is it a labor force? But the only people who don't welcome criminals and criminals come in, they can't make any effective contribution to the federal economic boom, apart from doing damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original plan was to sneak into the past, but with Mr. Kaile, it is entirely possible to apply for entry directly at the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next period of time, Du Lin could not leave the Imperial Capital. If he and the two major banks did not collide in the court, they would never have to sit down and talk about cooperation. Happening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s patent on insurance business is not intended to eat alone, not that he does not want to eat, so much money is personally known to earn it, can be problematic It is his limited amount, too much to eat will die, and in the current situation, the third giant economy is unlikely to appear in the empire. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the imperial central bank is the product of the current situation, then the southern commercial banks are caught up in the capital expansion, if there is an uncontrolled large economy within the empire, All of the cabinet members will be written in the book of the history of imperial shame, and it is also the cover character. If a country's polity is completely decoupled from the financial economy and decoupled from the people's livelihood, it will face an uncontrolled capitalist expansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two major economies have now gained a foothold in capital power and become the most reliable backing for capitalists, if another person has a firm foothold in the people’s livelihood To turn all the imperial citizens into their own armed forces, what else does the government play and play with themselves? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be a good idea, but it is not realistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So letting the insurance business go out and making it more important, it’s the most correct part of the social welfare and the basic guarantee of citizen life. select. As for the two major banks, Du Lin did not consider blocking them outside the door because they could not be stopped. Regardless of political and economic issues, in terms of behavior alone, if Doolin and the two big lines really tear their faces, in the end it will be like what happened today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am infringing on horses. Can you bite me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a barbaric way, the imperial central bank has the largest private armed force in the empire, and the South Commercial Bank is not much worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved in a civilized way, the two major banks have more than 10 billion yuan of funds, and the money Du Lin does not say win, the first round can not support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing can only be brought to court, and then the two sides have not stopped to drag on, before the trial results of the court, the two major banks can Continue to infring until the results come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as tearing the face into powder, and your own interests still have to fall into the hands of others, why bother? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the words in the dream of Du Lin can reflect enough precipitation and wisdom - peace and harmony! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give a part of the benefits and then give everyone a cover, hand the rope to the cabinet, who will dare to jump the cabinet to pull the rope. As the initiator and patent owner, Du Lin will of course prepare a pair of scissors for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the villa, Du Lin saw that Adams’s team was working actively. Du Lin already had an idea and really needed to make two big moves, not only Take away some of the benefits of yourself, and more importantly, they also take part of the risks. But before that, the two sides must take a look at the court, and only then will the two big lines sit at the negotiating table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With two years of playing with wealth, so many years of experience, they can not give up this market, and will try to ensure that they do not give up too much interest, do not collide, They are not willing to be willing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at them and when they were just about to say something, they both pulled him into another room, which was unusual. Du Lin looked at him with some organs, "What's wrong?" and closed the door with his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha’s expression was very serious. He took a sigh of relief and said, “The signal lines in our three major cities have been problematic.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin went to the sofa and rolled his brows and turned around. "What's the problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
