			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when the five-dollar bills appear on the table, all of them are twenty-dollar denominations. It doesn’t look like it’s just taken out of the bank. The brand new banknotes, some old, are change. It has become a bit embarrassing to collect money since the passage of the Official Crimes Act in the Imperial Parliament. In the past, this was just a very ordinary etiquette... well, a little bit unusual, at that time people The attitude toward power trading is not as extreme as it is now, and it is even considered a criminal act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that in the past nobles and officials often gave gifts to each other, such as a box of gold coins, or a manor, of course, it may be one or two A slave whose gender is completely different from the master. These are normal human relationships. The nobles are also happy to squander their wealth to prove their wealth and decentness to the people around them. There is nothing more decent than a pop-up of a gold coin at the time of tipping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a big problem in recent years. After the federal war of aggression, the whole society was in the process of rebuilding, and the merchants bought the power. The person is qualified to develop the city to ensure that his or her interests in the city are not compromised. In other words, this is actually a contractual behavior. I will give you money. You protect my life and property safety. Only in this way can the businessmen dare to put heavy money in a city and will definitely rise! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good thing to a certain extent. People’s inertia has not changed because of social and institutional changes. It can even be said at this time. The power-and-money transaction is more like an act of paying taxes to the lord in advance. The merchants are building in the territory, and they naturally need to divide the earned money into the lord to continue to operate, and at the same time, they can be protected by the lord. Very normal. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the improvement of the social system and all aspects, especially the abolition of the class hierarchy, which represents the feudal society, people began to pay attention to the harm of power and money transactions. And also legislate to punish this behavior. This is a change in the collective consciousness of the society. The public's ability to accept new things in the new era is very fast. They have begun to adapt to the trend, so they are very suitable for some things that do not conform to the trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry, who has been working with the investigation team recently, has such feelings. He feels that he has not done anything wrong, but he did something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When power reaches a certain level, it will inevitably attract money. Just as money accumulates to a certain amount, it will also lead to power. This is a very normal thing. Because only the two are entangled with each other, it will trigger the qualitative change of something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is 10,000..." Du Lin picked up the banknotes and made a fuss, although they were all old paper money, but they still Dooling’s fiddling made a good sound, and it was more pleasant than any other music in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official swallowed a sip, now he is not thirsty, "I don't understand...", 10,000 is not a small amount of money, in the eyes of many people It is a very large number. According to the statistics of the Imperial Ministry of Finance in the first half of the year, in the minimum wage law enforced in the empire, the lowest paid place can have 50 yuan a month, and the highest place is close to 60 yuan, pulling an average. This 10,000 yuan is the money that a person can work for 15 years without eating or drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even this official, his monthly salary plus various miscellaneous subsidies, but only 167, of course, there will definitely be Some other unofficial benefits and income, but definitely no more than three hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled. "I will explain it, maybe you will understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The money is old money that is not numbered. They have not flowed through any bank in the past three months. In other words, the money exists in this empire, but no one knows it." Who is it now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know why many gangs like to use such old notes when they trade? "Duo Lin put forward a question that has certain professionalism. Of course, in the face of this problem, the officials of the Social Service Bureau can't do anything but shake their heads. He really doesn't know. Du Lin threw the money back into the table and stacked it with the other four. "Because the money can avoid bank tracking, I am not sure how the bank tracked these numbers, but I know them. The same dead angle of operation, that is, the money has not entered the circulation in a short period of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, they are in anyone The hands are all legal, and no one can prove that the holders of the money hold the banknotes in violation of any law. At the same time, they will not cause any trouble when they re-enter the circulation."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example..." Du Lin looked at the official, and the officials tore the neckline. "If they are in your hands, it is legal. No one can prove that you should not have them. They can't do this. One thing, then everything is not a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official’s breathing was a little short, two years ago, before the anti-custodial bill was passed, his actual income Very high, several times now, but after the anti-traffic crimes bill passed, his income has dropped so much that he sold a property to pay the bank's loan. It’s not a big deal to get some money at that time, but it’s very difficult for him now,” Mr. Doolin, I’m not sure... and even if I’m willing to help you from my position, I can’t change the situation. I am just a specific person, although there is a little power..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not important!", Doolin from the low table I took out a tote in the drawer and put the money in. "You just need to tell me who can make a decision and let him come out and have a meal with us. You will know me, I It’s a very good person, and a person who is very happy to make friends. Are we friends now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has put all the money into one In the tote of the kraft paper, and then extended his hand, the officials of the Social Service Bureau looked at the paper bag, and his eyes filled with eagerness. His thoughts are struggling fiercely. He doesn't want to collect Du Lin's money because he doesn't know if it will bring more trouble to Du Lin's money. This is equivalent to handing a handle to Du Lin's hand. on. Today may just help him with someone, and maybe do other things in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is very hot, and also knows that Doolin is a bad guy. He has already heard from friends about the story that Du Lin happened in Kailemen. The position of Kailemen in the Imperial Capital is so special that some ordinary emperors do not dare to scatter in them, but Du Lin did it. Not only did he shock the Kailemen, but the next day, people saw Mr. Keller, who was beaten like a shit, which proved the energy and ability of Doolin. Not collecting money is a very simple decision, but this decision may have a series of serious consequences. I heard that Du Lin is sometimes very vengeful and very stingy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the struggle on his face and asked in a joke-like tone, "You are rejecting my friendship!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is like the last straw that overwhelmed the camel. The officials of the Social Service Bureau bite their teeth and squeezed a smile. They reached out again and held together with Doolin. “No, I am thinking about how to thank you for your generosity.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it generous?" Dulin haha ​​laughed. He handed the bag to the guy. "You are right, I am a generous person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving the official, Du Lin shook his head and went back to the living room to sit down. He could actually find Magus to say this, but it didn’t make sense. If anything went to Magus, This means that he is an incompetent person. The ability of each person is the value of this person in society. When the value of a person is getting lower and lower, the "commodities" around him will become cheaper and cheaper. When it is cheap to a certain extent, it will be doomed to be Dropped into the discount area, even thrown into the trash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guaranteeing your own value is the most correct approach, and it is a small matter in itself, there is no need to take the high-level route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of laying in southern cities has been solved. As Du Lin imagined, as long as the money is enough, the mayors in the south are willing to cooperate with Doolin. Commercial activity. Not only can it provide more jobs for a city, but it can also add a beautiful color to the city's tax revenue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only problems with Ilyan and the Imperial Capital. Du Lin believes that the Imperial Capital is not a problem at all, just thinking about the next steps. At the time, the phone rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This surprised him. This estate is the first time he came. Except for a very small number of people, no one knows that he lives here and can call. The people who hit here are definitely not ordinary people. After the phone rang three times, he called, "This is the Fieber Burton Manor." This is the name of the manor, and Doolin did not intend to modify the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earpiece was silent for about two seconds, and a very nice female voice sounded. "Is Mr. Doolin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice became more pleasing, "Hello, Mr. Doolin, I am a Southern Business Natiya of the bank, I took this call very embarrassed, I found this number very hard. First of all, I need to apologize to you, I may disturb your rest, I hope you can forgive me. Also, no Do you know if I am lucky enough to visit you or invite you to see one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial central bank has just finished the move, and now it is the turn of the Southern Commercial Bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
