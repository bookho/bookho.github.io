			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jack and the poker organization have very close ties with the finance ministries and major banks of various countries. Sometimes the reality is always more ridiculous than the novel, who is I can imagine such an international underground money laundering organization that is not legal at all. It is a good friend and an important department, bank, and institution of a country. In fact, the core thing is the interest. The interests make them a good friend. Anyone can become a friend or become an enemy in the face of huge interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of Mr. Jack and the poker organization, Doolin is confident to take the victory of this battle directly, they can directly cross Belitto or Taylor and With the dialogue between the two major councils and the dialogue with the Imperial Ministry of Finance and even the Cabinet, Du Lin’s chances of winning will be much greater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he still has a little human ambition, he wants to use the poker organization to organize international relations, and to open insurance companies to the world. But unfortunately, perhaps because the insurance company's excessive high-profile may also be due to other unknown reasons, the King and Queen chose to evade this business, and rejected Doolin's invitation, which added to Doolin's next battle. Less difficulty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is always a doubt in the depths of Doolin’s heart, that is, the ultimate purpose of the poker organization, just want to get more money. ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, they seem to be madly collecting money, and money laundering is a very profitable business, often requiring 30 to 5 percent. Ten fees, only those who are oversized and employers with high influence or social status, can get a cheap enough fee. Almost half of the funds that are handed over each year remain in this organization. This is an amazing number enough to see their desire for money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the other hand, the insurance business with great prospects and money-saving ability can’t enter the eyes of the poker organization. The profit brought by money laundering can be exaggerated, and it can completely create a global super economy, but they choose to avoid it, which is puzzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do they want to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin does not think that the poker does not understand the benefits of the insurance business, and the organization that has done the money laundering at this level has basically left the realm of small troubles. They must have a group of people, such as very professional economic analysts, who do not necessarily understand the benefits of the insurance business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the Tusi religion, who is the person or organization behind them, and what they want to do through the Tusi teaching, everything is a mystery, a mystery that cannot be solved. Dooling didn't know if there was any chance to know these mysteries, maybe, maybe not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days of calmness means that things are continuing to ferment outside of Du Lin’s line of sight. On the fifth day, Du Lin came alone to Verrier. A big shopping mall. This shopping mall is also one of the best in Villier. From the first floor to the sixth floor, it is full of luxury brands from the emperor and abroad, and of course there are some popular brands that ordinary people can afford. The entire building uses a convoluted structure with a huge patio in the middle. For the western part of the land, the builders don't need to think about how to use the limited space more reasonably, just the most beautiful design. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The multi-story, revolving structure of the patio is one of the biggest attractions in this mall, and a large number of vine climbing plants turn the patio into a huge green The waterfall, even in the summer, gives people a cool feeling, and people feel a little cool in the hot temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin chose to sit down in a corner of the bench, holding the newspaper of the morning, the Imperial Daily. This newspaper, which resembles a semi-official mouthpiece, quickly adhered to the real official after the fall of the George family. The news they reported was rigorously known. Most of the content was important domestic and international political and economic developments, as well as internal empire. The interpretation of some policies can be said to be the largest circulation newspaper in China, and there is no one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I missed the recent political news of Magnus and foreign heads of state, and in the third edition of Doolin, I saw his old friend, Colliers’ news. . After more than a month of reorganizing the family's rectification of Colliers, he re-executed the Colliers Railway Group and declared war on the federal "invaders" in the name of private individuals, to completely block the railway engineering enterprises from the federal government to the imperial market. Invasion. In the news, Colliers described the dangers of using foreign capital to build railways, and even raised the harm to the national level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that as the most important transportation system at present, the railway down represents the convenience of people’s travel, and it represents the national security of a country, which is related to people’s livelihood. The projects linked to national defense cannot be handed over to the federal people who have had intrusion, and all the enterprises and organizations that have transferred the project to the federal businessmen headed by the joint construction workers include the official departments, which are all acts of selling the country. Strictly rebuked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, the entire version of the third edition was divided into left and right sides. There was a lightning bolt in the middle that cut the layout into two. On the left, Colliers waved his arm and pointed to the right side. The face was serious and hateful, just saw With this picture, I can imagine the scene where this old guy spits. On the right is the current CEO of United Construction, the executive director of the board of directors and the second largest shareholder. He looks more likable. He looks like a gentleman in his fifties when he is wearing a formal dress and sitting at his desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also expressed his opinion on Colliers’s argument that he believes that the constant rolling of the times will inevitably turn the whole world into a whole, the Empire and The federation has hundreds of years of profound friendship. It should not use a fragment of history to replace all the relations between the two countries. He believes that the cooperation between the Empire and the Federation will be further deepened and seek common interests in the international arena. . The joint construction work is the main driving force for promoting economic exchanges and cooperation between the Empire and the Federation. It should not be called the arbitrarily vocabulary of the "aggressor". He believes that the cooperation of the joint construction workers in the bilateral economic field can Play a better role in promoting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And also listed a lot of data, for example, how many tens of thousands of workers were employed in the empire because of the international business of the joint construction, how many thousands The jobs, the amount of tax paid for the empire, and so on, are a lot of seemingly horrific data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Colliers Railway Group and the joint construction workers have been fighting each other for a while, which is very attractive to people. It is said that because of Colliers Resisting and confronting, the share price of the joint construction workers has not only failed to fall, but has continued to rise. Many evaluators believe that it is precisely because Colliers put the joint construction work in the role of "aggressor", so that the joint construction workers have gained more supporters in the federal territory, they are more optimistic about the future of joint construction. This caused this phenomenon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth edition of a group of commentators used the two big men to open a gun to paint a sense of presence, with a variety of strange angles, strange positions Strange eyes and strange descriptions have written a whole bunch of weird comment articles. One of the commentators also thought that this was a very tacit commercial hype between Colliers and United Construction, because everyone focused on the two, ignoring the other smaller railways. The construction company, so that in just over a month, the railway orders in the empire were mainly concentrated in the two, allowing other contractors to enter the embarrassing situation of not getting orders! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin feels that this comment is very interesting. The means of turning commercial visibility into economic effects is the simplest and the easiest to succeed. One-sidedly, both sides pass Such hype has led many onlookers who do not know the truth to establish a concept in the subconscious that there are only two companies in the world that will build railways, one is the Colliers Railway Group, the other is joint construction, and the other? Of course, there is no such thing. How can there be a third company? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
