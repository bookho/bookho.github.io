			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Policy Research Group, or Research Office, is a special team dedicated to the Royal Family. In the old society in the past, many of the policies and regulations promulgated by the royal family were made by this department. Their research on policy can be said to be the deepest in the empire. Many of them have set up their own service teams or think tanks after the dissolution of the department, serving some big families. This time Kevin is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strictly speaking, Du Lin and the old gentleman still have a certain relationship. If the old gentleman broke the production in Otis, he may not be willing Stand up and serve others. Some of these people have the pride and arrogance of the past. They feel that they are living for the top level. If they are not the top, they will not do anything if they are starving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the ultimate ideal will eventually bow to reality. The old gentleman after bankruptcy thinks that he should find something to do. The money doesn’t matter, the key is to play it. The rest of the heat, doing something, has a little contribution to society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great idea has been spurring him until someone introduced him to a job in the middle of the night, only to let him find the opportunity to teach his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting for about half an hour or so, the mysterious old gentleman was late. He is wearing a very old-fashioned costume, which is similar to the style of the past court costumes, with a lot of cumbersome and pattern, looking at the eyes with a little hair. The slightly sparse hair also made him meticulously combed, and each one was evenly contaminated with enough wax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very elegant old gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will introduce you..." After Kevin and Doolin shake hands with the old man, Kevin took the initiative to introduce him. He introduced the old gentleman first. Mr. Hersman, who is a member of the Royal Policy Research Group, has made a core part of the very heavyweight policies promulgated by the royal family.” Then he began to introduce Mr. Hersman Lin, "This is Mr. Doolin. I think you should have some understanding, even if I don't introduce it in detail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hellman nodded Du Lin’s self-promotion in recent times has been very dense, deep and strong, and almost everyone in the streets has created a position for him, which makes him spend money like water. A large number of spontaneous conscience social activists are running for him. These people start counting banknotes every day. The sponsorship fee of a person may not be anything, but one hundred, one thousand or even more is an amazing accumulation. The number. With these people doing promotion, Hersman must know if he doesn't want to know the news that has a relationship with Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he lives in this society, he will leave the house and contact the society, he will inevitably know something about Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two shook hands, and then Kevin let the maid change a flower tea and pastry, and the three sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, to be honest, I was very surprised when I received this call yesterday. I called my very good friend, otherwise I may not I will come out to work. But since I took the job, I must do it well. My professional ethics does not allow me to do things that are detrimental to my personal reputation. Before we start the topic, I want to mention a few The problem.” Mr. Hellsmann’s performance was more positive than that of Du Lin’s imagination. He didn’t even ask if Doolin was willing to hire him to build the campaign team, and he started working directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, after learning about Mr. Hellsman and his social circle, Du Lin felt that the dead horse was a living horse, not necessarily a way out. Good campaign teams have been chosen, and the rest are often “temporary teams” with rich experience of failure. Each of these members who have not had a successful case has their own main job, and only when they receive a job, they will get together and start working. It is conceivable that the reliability of such a temporary work team is low. Hiring these teams is a gamble. In addition to money, the loss may be eight years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Mr. Hellsman is not a professional campaign team member, he may not do well. The people he knows and the connections he has made are enough for him to deal with Du. The situation that Lin wants to face. In addition, Du Lin’s election is not the state’s prime minister. It’s just a governor... but only! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. "Since I have chosen you, we should be honest with each other, but the same, Mr. Hersman, in us. Before talking about a more in-depth topic, should we sign a confidentiality agreement for this conversation?" He smiled. "In order to ensure your interests, my interests are not infringed. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Hellsmann is like nothing to understand, nodded and said, "If this is more formal, I agree."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin immediately took out two contracts. Without too many terms, Hellsmann had a glorious past and he was quite clear about some legal issues. After confirming that there was no problem, Du Lin signed his name with him. Regardless of the outcome, he and Hersman could not disclose anything about the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Mr. Hellsman, you can ask questions." After Kevin reviewed the two documents, as a middleman, he must not let each other be silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Hellsmann nodded and asked, "The first question, where do you want to get, is related to the next campaign." The problem of planning needs to be very well prepared to formulate strategies, such as a city or a state. The second question, your political position and political opinions, because of geographical problems, some may be very common. Advocating that it will not work in some areas, the reason...", he laughed twice, and the laughter was full of ridicule against Doolin. "The third question, how much authorization can I get, it depends on you. The desire for success."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are all minor issues. After Du Lin’s truthful answer, Mr. Hellsmann considered it for a moment and said with a smile, “Accurately, Mr. Dooling, even without me, as long as your plan has no major problems, you can win." He is a big truth, and Du Lin wants to take the position of the governor of a random state in the three western states. It’s not a big question to say Dulin’s now. . No big problem does not mean that there is no problem. Du Lin can understand the other meaning of his words. Then Hells said with some pride, "But with me, I can make sure that you can complete your plan. This is my role."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "100%?", Du Lin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hellman gave a positive answer, "100%!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin and Kay After the two looked at each other, Du Lin slowly nodded. He stood up. Mr. Hellsman and Kevin also stood up. He reached out and smiled. "So why not buy one for my plan?" What about insurance? Mr. Hellsman, the next thing is to come to you, I will do my best to cooperate, whether it is financial or human."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hellman smiled and held a hand with Du Lin, saying, "This is of course, the value of my standing here is for all this, Mr. Doolin!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy cooperation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy cooperation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They signed another contract, from the immediate start to the end of the general election, Hellsmann will set up a campaign team for Doolin to help Du Lin complete the campaign goal as much as possible on the contract. There is no guarantee it will succeed. Risk aversion is not only applicable in the financial sector, but also in the political arena. To this end, Du Lin needs to pay Hersman's personal expenses of 600,000 yuan, and no less than one million team expenses, in addition to preparing at least not less than five million campaign funds, and also asked for another five Millions of follow-up replenishment funds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
