			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Ellis walked into the office, there were a few erythema in the clothes on his body. He ran back this way, he put the bicycle Leave it to other companions so that they can get back faster when they encounter unexpected situations. He gasped slightly, his face was a little white, and he felt the heavy atmosphere when he opened the door, but he quickly shifted his attention from this aspect to what he wanted to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wood...Go to Godor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a word, let it be low With his head licking the cigarette but not igniting, the Buddha raised his head and turned Du Lin, who looked at the street and the vehicle outside the window, turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is far from familiar with other members of the Association, and his understanding of Turner remains on the surface. Even so, he has heard of the name of Dodore and some of his deeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people are praising a gang leader, it means that the gang and their leader are about to change their status and status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either die, or be born! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Codor is clearly the latter, his business is almost completely whitewashed, and there may be some parts that are also related to violations of imperial law and theocracy. The article, but it is innocuous for him. As long as he can thoroughly wash himself, he will be able to cross the threshold of all the leaders who are most eager to cross the past and become a member of the upper class in the city of Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is yearning for the upper class, so what is there in the upper class? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entering the upper class, you have to eat, you have to drink water, you have to make money, and you will be restrained. But everyone wants to be a member of the upper class because it represents a change in status, representing the environment in which they are exposed and the changes in people and things. If you cross the road, you will always be a member of the lower class that is not influx, and will always be exploited and oppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper class is actually a platform, a ladder to a higher level, perhaps wanting to climb this ladder needs to throw some heavy things, but in order to At a higher level, the charge is launched, and almost everyone is willing to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gotol is such a person who is already famous for the city of Tener. His kindness, enthusiasm, integrity, and hypocrisy are circulated among the people...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also The leader of the biggest gang in the city of Tener, with hundreds of characters under his hand, is definitely not comparable to the already washed white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the biggest crisis in Doolin’s history. If you can’t get through it, there’s no second way except running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Codor is indeed actively washing white, but he does not mind occasionally taking a hand during the whitewashing process. It may be a trivial accident for him, a devastating blow to Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin licked his face, patted his cheek and looked at the Buddha. "Is there a chance to kill him?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha’s face shook his head heavily. “The song is a legendary person. He knows the rules very much. Many big people like his rules. It is said that some big people occasionally resort to it. He does things that big people can't do, can't do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is very careful, whether at home or out, he is following A lot of people. In the past nine years, he has experienced at least 30 assassinations, but he has never been successful, but he has become more careful. It is said that he asked people to make a set of linings. The iron piece of clothing, whether it is a weapon or a firearm, can hardly kill him without hitting his head and neck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin points Nod, this is what it should be, no matter how white he is now washing white, he used to step on others. Blood and bones climbed the current high levels. Hate him, and he can’t wait to kill him. He will definitely pay attention to his own safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how to solve the current dilemma? Not to kill Codor, at least let him maintain a neutral attitude in this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was immersed in meditation, and all of them turned their heads, and Ellis quietly left the office and took the door, hiding it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About more than 20 minutes, the office door was opened from the inside, and Du Lin walked out calmly, with a thick brow Confident, Dufu and Airlis immediately greeted him and looked at him with the look of anticipation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded with a certain amount and said, "I have a way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Du Lin’s approach is very simple, that is to satisfy the Chowdor "condition"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Stoll can be reckless, and does not need any gains, it will be shot for Wood. Why did the previous battle Gothor not appear? Du Lin thought that the relationship between Wood and Codor was not as strong as he thought. Wood must have used something to impress Codor, so that Cedore would be willing to make him. Then think about it, and how can Godor be able to make Wood for something, can he change his position for something? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thinks this is possible. From his understanding of the one-sidedness of Codor, this is a very ambitious and self-disciplined guy. His aim was to become the tycoon of the city of Tener, becoming one of the rule-makers... to lower it, at least to become one of the providers of the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more important than being able to become a member of the upper class faster, and the threshold for many people who are struggling to live is more important to him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meet his "conditions", then watch him reborn, then wait for him to make a mistake and give him a fatal blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, Du Lin needed to meet a few people, a few who could change the decision of the Gothor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked Ellis to keep staring at Codor and let all the fellows in the fellowships return to their homes, without finishing the matter. Don't appear in people's sight before. When he is ready, he will appear after all the things he has to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Codor is not Wood, he is not a gentleman, not a high society figure who has crossed the boundaries. He doesn't need to pay attention to demeanor and decent, he only needs to pay attention to efficiency. In order to prevent him from finding other members of the fellowship, Du Lin needed to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin found Kevin, Kevin was packing his bags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago the Metropolitan Court sent a notice that an additional trial will be held in three days, and it is said that the Cannes State Court asked the local court to immediately resolve the It has triggered cases of national public concern and minimized some negative effects as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
