			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of Prando during the Teign City Regional Police Department as the Director of the Police Department, the complexity of seeing people is far more than the average person many. It is also because I have seen so many people, and at the same time I am in the officialdom, so he is very keen to capture a point - Delier does not necessarily know the three people, especially he saw three faces of a little human form Prando understood when the guys who couldn’t find them were able to smash their forged identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreil does not know the three people, but he knows what to say, which represents the "export gas" proposed by Delil in this matter. "Not his most real appeal, he should have other purposes. At the same time, this awakening also made him even more confused. Whether it is blackmailing the director of the regional police station, he still hopes to extort the gang leader Goulduo. It is not a sissy for Delil. Good choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not be sheltered by Mrs. Vivian forever, and for Mrs. Vivienne, Delier is not necessarily irreplaceable. Using his life as a chip to blackmail two of his offending characters, is he crazy, or what other ideas? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Prando pulled him aside and asked, "What do you want from me?" The smile on his face disappeared. Instead, it's a touch of sin. "Whatever you want, start with a bid. This is not a game for one person. There must always be multiple parties to complete the final transaction."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreil looked at the side after a glimpse, "I don't know what you said!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know!" Rondo’s tone was very blunt, and he sneered. “Do you want money? Come here for someone who can’t name it? Or do you have to use this method to solve the problem?” Say it, I Think about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the more simply this time, the more Prando did not dare to go too far, precisely because of Deli’s hesitation and hesitation and a trace The timidity of the silk made Prando see a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not guilty of Mrs. Vivian, but he offended the sissy. Indeed, this sissy is the wife of Mrs. Vivian, but people are different, and people have prices in this society. The director of a regional police station and the curator of an art gallery are at a glance. If he offends Delil and even makes excessive things, Mrs. Vivian is likely to vent his anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But anger is not hate, anger is always a product of a time, even if the time is longer, it will gradually dissipate. He believes that he can compensate Mrs. Vivian's anger in her own way, but as it is now unclear, she suffers from the fear of the unknown, but he is suffering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is eager to know what is the purpose of Delil’s doing this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delier’s mouth twitched twice, and when he felt that Prando was stabbing himself as if he had a real fierce gaze, his heartbeat began to accelerate. The body began to heat up and sweat began to appear on the back. He opened his mouth and wanted to say something but did not say it. The next second he felt a huge force hitting him and slamming him into the wall behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slamming sound, Delier’s face showed a painful expression, and Prando licked his collar with both hands and lifted him up. Tightly against the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My patience is limited, I don't like guessing games. You can't say it, but you have to know where it is, there are at least two thousand here. A stupid big man is waiting to lick your ass. I don't guarantee that you can stand and leave, and all this is your choice!", Prando also made a fuss, he didn't know what Delier's purpose was. I don't know what Delier will say after going back, but he will never say good things about himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the matter is very simple, Mrs. Vivienne tells him a few bad words in front of the mayor, but if things are serious, then Delil’s statement is extremely It may cause him to lose something he can't lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, why not gamble? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dizzy stunned by the collision, the devil’s face with the back cracking has begun to whitish, and the sweat is not standing in the face where he applied makeup. Staying in the foot, directly on the hands of Prando. He groaned and groaned for about a dozen seconds before he shouted: "I said, let me go, let me go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando I loosened my hands and took a step back. I took off my own cigarette and stuffed it into Delier's mouth. "I listen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ger Lear took a sip of smoke, and his hand took the cigarette and took it off his lips. His eyes turned twice. "I want money, a lot of money..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
