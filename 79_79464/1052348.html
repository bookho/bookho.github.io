			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are sure..." Julio threw two newspapers on the table, one for the Verrier Daily and one for the Western News. He leaned over and looked at the secretary who had been with him for nine years. He asked for the first time. "Are you sure that we really spent money on these newspapers? Why didn't I see my photo appear on the head?" Version, this is not good for our next job!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, what he said at the symposium is not all jokes, Julio is In the South, it has been found that the influence brought by public opinion is very huge. Many times, with the help of public opinion, what you want to do is far more attractive to the people than what you have done, and it is easier to get recognition from others. As for whether it has been done or not, it is another matter after a few years. There was a reporter at the symposium yesterday. I was very familiar with this set of Julio and did not evade reporters. I also invited some reporters to attend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But look at the newspaper this morning, the headlines of the two very heavyweight newspapers are all Dulin’s photos, which have been in the text below. Full of words like "Mr. Du Lin said" or "Mr. Doolin thinks", it seems that Du Lin is the protagonist of yesterday's symposium. His mayor is actually a supporting role. In the case of such a situation, Julio is not very concerned about it. He cares that Du Lin’s influence has overshadowed his new mayor. This is what makes people feel astonished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times the influence of capitalists is actually above government officials. This is very clear to Julio, but these capitalists will make concessions in some respects. The tacit cooperation is the most suitable way to survive by capital forces and official forces. But here, it seems to be a little different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspaper clearly made an amazing choice. They chose to put Duolin on the front page to print today’s newspapers, indicating local newspapers and even local newspapers. In people's minds, Doolin's influence and attitude are far above the city hall. People are more convinced of Doolin’s words. All aspects of society also want to know what Du Lin did today and what he said, not what the Mayor did and what he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This symposium was initiated by Julio, the journalist was also invited by Julio, and he also provided a hundred for the newspapers the journalists worked for. The public relations fee for money. Of course, this is done by his own team. In the developed areas of the south, many officials of the main party have such a private team, and they all learn from those capitalists. This allows them to save a lot of time, and many things can help them find the best solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if something goes wrong, we must first figure out which part of the link is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the real reason Julio had said at the symposium yesterday that he spent too little money. Compared with a public relations fee of one or two hundred, Du Lin’s public relations expenses are always calculated in thousands of dollars. He knows that there are no lower limits for these newspapers and journalists. Especially after the fall of the George family, the competition between the newspapers has become increasingly fierce, and the way of competition has also undergone tremendous changes. In the past, the competition between newspapers was sales, and there was hot news. Now they are competing for how to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the fee-based news has become a top priority. Even the tough partner like Du Lin, even the mayor has to stand by. Of course, you can't be overly offended. In the second edition, you have a photo of Julio and his wonderful remarks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although yesterday’s symposium did not let Du Lin say what he wanted him to say, but the harvest is still there, at least positively understand what is missing in the West. . The lack of educational resources and medical resources is currently the preferred problem to be solved, especially the former. There is no comprehensive university in a region. It seems to be a failure in Julio. Every city in the south has at least one comprehensive university. The university is not only a place to cultivate talents, but also to train these people to be familiar with the local environment and to produce locally. Where it depends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people from other places have stayed in the local learning process and become "children raised for other cities." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the most urgent need to solve now is a series of problems left by the door farmers, for example, the three guarantee policy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three Guarantees Policy as a government policy and regulation promoted the popularity and recognition of the Kadima in the West, but with the death of the Mennon and the Kadima Party being liquidated Some people have already smelled something that is not quite right, and the storm clouds are coming. Once these people get out of the way, Julio will be the first victim. He can't continue to support the stupid policy of the three-guarantee policy, but if he denies the policy of three guarantees, it means that he wants to become the enemy of many working classes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a matter of returning money to people to quell people’s anger, those who have paid a certain amount of insurance on a pro rata basis, and look forward to these insurance benefits. The people who play a role will not be able to retreat. They need the mayor to personally tell them that the insurance is still valid. In particular, both student insurance and medical insurance, because these two are almost everyone's use. Once the child is admitted to the university, even if it is a community college, isn't the university, this heavy tuition burden does not require the family to bear, they just pay tens of dollars before and after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
