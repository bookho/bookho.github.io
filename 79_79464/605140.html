			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of the cold field seems to be cold, but on the contrary, the people who are prepared are confident and calm, but those who are not prepared can worry about it. Anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karl has been giving Ernst a wink, and it is clear that the situation is not the same as what he envisioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a silent atmosphere, the waiter came over with a steak, placed it in front of Doolin, and placed a knife and fork for him - a total of Two sets, because there is a small piece of food in addition to the steak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to use tableware can extend a thick academic book, and the aristocrats’ demand for the details of life makes them everyday. The pain in the eyes of ordinary people, it is true that this is also true. It takes about two hours to dress up every day. If you want to attend some grand banquets, this time may be longer. How can ordinary people suffer from ordinary life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the eyes of the nobility, the standardization of speech and behavior is the most effective way to distinguish between "noble" and "untouchables" in this new era. For the rules they have come out, they are becoming more and more strict, and it seems that in this way they can get a superior pleasure. Especially when they are arrogant and look at the unidentified people with a pitiful smile, they will make a helpless expression to the people around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, this is the untouchables! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are many things in the rules of the nobility that do not have value, people like to follow suit because everyone wants to be the elite of the upper class. Molecule, that is a class and circle full of certain temptations, so that all people who claim to be successful people want to get in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are always laughing at or smashing some mainstream things, such as power, such as money, such as class. But everyone is also envious of those who have these things. This is a very contradictory psychological activity. In another world, people call this kind of psychology "the enemy." Enmity and enmity is not just rich, there are many other things that you don’t have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a high-end restaurant, the reception is naturally also an identity person, Du Lin does not know this, so he chose to be relatively more convenient, also Big one tableware to dine. He cut the steaks very rudely, and inserted a piece of beef that was obviously over the fork into the mouth, chewed a few times and swallowed, and nodded with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taste is much better than all the steaks he has ever eaten. He never tasted so good. When he looked back at the waiter, he paused a little and then asked: "This steak comes from Where?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter’s face has a very standard smile, revealing eight teeth, clean and tidy teeth with a faint glow under the light "This is Wagley. It is only produced in a very small part of the empire. The price is very expensive. You need to eat 68 pieces for this one, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin blew a whistle, sixty-eight, how many bottles of wine do you have to sell to earn a person to eat a meal? Undoubtedly, the red wine on the table and the food in front of the two big men, the price of this meal definitely exceeded his imagination. To know that he has licked the bread that is harder than the stone, he must sprinkle a little water and then heat it next to the fire to barely squat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too extravagant, he sighed and continued to eat beef pieces with uneven corners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the two have nothing to say?" Du Lin asked as he chewed, and the meat and soup were shot from his mouth. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karul looked at Du Lin indifferently, but Ernst opened his mouth first. He first frowned and observed Du Lin for a while. Only some hesitantly asked: "You are the one day... a dollar?", this sentence with obvious inquiries, because Ernst first saw Doolin himself, but also remembered that day. The kid helped him send some things to other people's hands and paid a dollar for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also noticed Ernst at this time, and then nodded very happily. "I remembered, since it is an acquaintance, then the next Things are easier to say.", Du Lin wiped his mouth after swallowing the last steak, and leaned back. "Wood is dead, but someone has to pick up his class, I know. There are some rules of agreement between you and others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I intend to abide by this agreement!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin had a whole idea before he came. The rules of the game set by the boss are not what he can destroy now. If he doesn't want to be the next one, he will die in a dark corner and become a mouse food. The hapless, then he must learn to join the game as a "gamer". The rule is not built to make it ruined by someone or something one day. As long as Doolin does not show this idea, he is safe for at least a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
