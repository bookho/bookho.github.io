			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louis has a secret, no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father is not the honest and honest cobbler, but the master of the city, the mayor of Nano Lindes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mother, who was the mayor’s mistress, was unable to marry the mayor because she was pregnant, so she chose a good family and she was very honest and honest. The cobbler is his future life partner. The reason why he was able to discover this was because he secretly followed his mother at the age of seven and played a game of police thiefs that only one person knew. He saw his mother enter a luxurious The villa did not come out for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited for a long time at the door, not that he didn't want to go home, but he forgot the way home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he saw his mother coming out of the villa with a man’s arm and both saw him. He still remembers the man pointing at him and asking who the child was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mother smiled and told the man that this is your child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is an illegitimate child, and for a long time he felt that this was a shame to him, and for this he hated his mother, and his only I have seen my father once. He often wanted to tell him about his current father, but he thought that the family might be broken. The one who always regarded him as his only father might collapse. He hid this secret in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until he is an adult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of adults and the world of children seem to be different. Children always have very clear views of right and wrong, this is good, then It is bad. It is not easy to change the heart of distinguishing between right and wrong because of any persuasion or candy temptation. But adults are different. Adults are too tempted or coerced. They are always bowing to the fate of compromise. They are right, and they will violate the conscience and say that it is wrong, just to prevent themselves from being hurt. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his father sent him a set of utility knives for making leather goods, he realized that this might not be the way he wanted to go. He didn't want to waste his life in a small room and mix it with the strange smell of leather. He didn't want to be a cobbler, he didn't want to pick up the stinky feet of those tall people, and he also carefully measured the data for them. . He didn't want to be the cobbler who sold a lot of leather goods, but he was not willing to wear it, even if the cobbler could make a lot of money, and it was still someone's dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he found his biological father and hoped that the other person could arrange a decent job for him. The man did not immediately promise him, but asked him to say "papa", which is what his father meant, but more colloquial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then he has received the first bucket of gold in his life, a thousand dollars, and a promising job - the boss of a company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He built a garbage station with a thousand pieces according to his father’s request, then bought some human garbage trucks and took them in an unimaginable way. Got a community garbage collection project. He once thought that this was the father who was humiliating him. After the first month of settlement, he realized that this is life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garbage This thing seems to be very inconspicuous, indeed it is, the garbage generated in the lower city is always just garbage. But in Shangcheng District, especially in some communities that live in high society, garbage is a treasure. The rich and their women simply don't care how many times their clothes are worn, and if they are broken, they will be thrown into the trash as soon as time arrives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are hundreds of pieces worth of garbage before a certain period of time, in addition to garbage, there are some "not worth the money" trinkets, or furniture Something like that. He only needs to transport these things to the recycling station. With a simple treatment, they can be sold to ordinary people at a relatively high price, and even some middle classes have become his regular customers. They buy these luxury items at a low price to make them set off their own rich and decent, which is a very cost-effective deal for everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more his dumpster business grew, the more he eliminated all the manual garbage trucks, replaced them with better trucks, and expanded the business to the whole. Urban area. No one knows his relationship with the mayor, only their "family" knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used to think that he might grow up in these garbage dumps forever in his life, and occasionally help his biological father, the great mayor to monitor a certain Some big people, or what to look for from the garbage of these people. Until a while ago, his father gave him a sum of money, let him buy some very expensive and heavy machines, and ordered a lot of materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he has such a factory, a parts factory that produces "money". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything he produces here will be sold to another person who was the secretary of the mayor and later dismissed because he made a mistake. Just as many people do not know that Louis is the son of the mayor, these people do not know that the secretary and the mayor still maintain a very close relationship. He was dismissed, just to show the show to others, he helped the mayor to deal with things that were not officially shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nano Lindes is a mixed bag, and some things are really not very convenient for the official. For example, some people did not follow the rules of the game in the city, they crossed the line, but did not leave any obvious handle. Obviously you know that they are damn, but they can't shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the role of the secretary is reflected, he can do it, because he is a despicable villain, even the generous mayor can not accommodate him. The dispute between him and those people is just an anecdote about the dog’s biting the dog’s talk after the meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the iron rule of the mayor’s 22 years in Nano Lindes. He said that he will not go anywhere in his life. Even if you retire, you must retire in Nano Lindes. These words have made many people become his supporters, and feel that this is a very very good good mayor... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former secretary with glasses looking very gentle has walked into the factory from the small door, and he glanced at the stack of tokens stacked on one side. Take out the book and record it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't trust me?", Louis saw that this guy used his book and pen to record everything he saw here, and he was very upset, which made He feels like a thief, and he is still in his own factory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former secretary smiled and closed the notebook and the pen. "I can’t talk about it!" In fact, Louis said it was right. The former secretary did not trust him. Long did not say that Louis had anything to do with him, but with the tacit understanding that the former secretary has been helping the mayor for years, he has already guessed how the bastard and the mayor are involved. He didn't look at this kid, and he took it for granted. In addition to relying on the mayor's face to contract the garbage collection in Shangcheng District, he had a little reputation, and he actually didn't have any ambitions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you change someone else, with such a good platform, maybe it has developed better. And this guy, who knows how to eat, drink, and have fun all day, how can he see such a guy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garbage is always rubbish. It won't be garbage because it can sell money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to take this shipment, you will arrange for people to load the car, and now they will stop after the completion of the hand, to return to visit our Friends, see how they are." The former secretary gave a sigh and walked to the edge of the assembly line, picking up a polished chip, and finely rubbing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tokens have a layer of silver on the surface, and they cost a lot of brains for these materials. The large denomination tokens used in the city of Otis have unique places. For example, the five hundred tokens are like silver, and the one thousand is like gold. In order to make it difficult to distinguish, they finally adopted a more stupid way, that is, copper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver and gold hammers were made into a thin piece of cloth, then wrapped in a layer of copper, and then overcome many difficulties, took three days They solved the problem of making large denomination tokens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things... are all money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former secretary’s eyes flashed a fascination, and soon he woke up, if the design of the mayor’s adult, even if the nano Lindes was declining Their earnings will not be shaken too much. Every day, a steady stream of cash flows from the city of Otis into their pockets. In the past, because of the many interests involved, the mayor did not intend to leave here. He could see that Nano Lindes was about to embark on the road of decline. The mayor suddenly raised the mind of the campaign governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The campaign governor needs money, only a lot of money can buy all the key important people, so that the members of the state council can cast their own valuable votes, Only then can make more posters to fill the streets. Only after having a lot of money can they use money to attract people from all walks of life. In the next election year, they will choose the option that belongs to the mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collecting more funds for yourself, but also being able to combat this opponent who has destroyed the mayor’s 22-year-old business, which is quite good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the former secretary left with all the accumulated tokens, Louis also put on his coat. He didn't like the former secretary in his mouth, but he knew that this person represented the meaning of his personal father. He had to return to those who used fake tokens to see if there was any problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
