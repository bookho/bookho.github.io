			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, according to plan, Amp should arrive in Nano Lindes two weeks ago and encountered some unexpected situations on the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case handler of the case he had taken over may have alerted the target, so the provincial sages launched the so-called "big things" ahead of time. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They attacked a town and began to eclipse the surrounding area with this town. The Ministry of National Defense urgently mobilized the relevant army to suppress it, responsible for the case. The Anna team also needs to go to the first scene. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the provincial ultra-reunification organization has been ravaged in the western part of the empire. According to the analysis of Amp and the work of intelligence personnel, some clues on the scene have been combined. Amp locked a federal rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rich man has been providing sports funding for the Holy Fire organization, and sometimes asks them to do something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly short organizations have been identified in the empire. There are already six fund supporters from the federation, and there is a great possibility that the federation Those people did this in order to disrupt the law and order within the empire. As for whether there is a higher level of political purpose, Amp is not willing to think about it. He is very satisfied with his current work and life. He does not need to think about other things, just do what he likes to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A photo is placed confusingly on his desk, the most of which are the chips except the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the clues he got, he could draw a conclusion very close to the truth, an organization headed by Toled, the former mayor of Nano Lindes Secretly making counterfeit money, they intend to use such counterfeit money to attack the "Doolin rule" of Otis, and also get a lot of money from there. Unfortunately, this incident was discovered by Du Lin, and he killed the killer and killed these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case is very simple and difficult, just like Doolin’s previous style, there is not much flaw, no valuable clues, let alone accusations Lin's evidence. He is still so embarrassed that he has not left anything useful to do things now, and he has also placed his back. The evidence materials in the hands of Amp not only have to be copied back to the Emperor, but also a copy of the Ministry of Defense sent to the Empire, where he is told that he will be inquiries at any time to understand the specific content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the large number of rifles and a portable heavy weapon in this case, some people in the Ministry of Defense believe that it may involve military crimes. Anything involving the military will not be a trivial matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Navy has already passed through the bottom, and they don’t want the Army to be like that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp looked at some of the clues recorded in the book and meditated, Du Lin’s “criminal” means became more and more simple and violent, and the clues and flaws existed. Fewer and fewer. In the ancient origins, there is a sentence that sums up many experiences full of wisdom. Probably means that the more complicated a lock is, the easier it is to be opened. On the contrary, if you only install a single-sided latch in the door, even if the thief can open all the locks in the world, it is impossible to enter the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a story behind this sentence, saying that there is a very amazing thief in the origin, he has no place to enter, whether it is called As the origin of the origin of all things, it is still a room in the temple, as long as he thinks, he can go in and still come out. Once he took a fancy to a rich man's collection, so he wrote a letter to the rich man and told him that at 12 o'clock that night, he would steal the thing on time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich man found the most intelligent person in the area and asked him how to solve it. The man told him that he used a big rock to smash a door with no window. The room, then put the collection inside, and then put it in one person. From inside, insert the iron fiber into the jack through the iron ring on the iron plate, and you can ensure that the rich man's things are intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich man obediently did it, and when the thief appeared, he looked at the house that was almost a whole stone dumbfounded. He has dexterous fingers and amazing touch. No matter how complicated the lock can be opened in a short time, but in the face of such a "house" that is locked from the inside and there is no gap outside, he has no way. Can only sigh and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not the thief, he is the smart person, he has gradually understood that the more people involved in doing something, the more complicated the process The easier it is to make mistakes, and it will leave traces and clues. So he became very rude, just like a whim, without a premeditated direct start, killing people and leaving, except for the tire prints left by the cheap tires, he did not expose anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to catch Doolin and send him to jail, he will catch up with him step by step when he is not mature enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Amp has given up, because it doesn't make much sense to check it out. The day of the incident was the first week of celebration in the city of Otis. At that time, Doolin hosted the event in various large business premises. Countless people saw him and saw him without leaving the city of Otis. The evidence that his men are not present, plus his connections and prestige in the city of Otis, it is too simple to find a few perjury witnesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to catch Du Lin, you have to prove that Doolin has something to do with this. This requires a sufficient chain of evidence to support, but now he has nothing. He didn't know where the group of performers came from, how many people, and who. So why use this attack to prove Du Lin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By feeling? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the original big robbery of Tyner’s gold left a lot of clues to be traced step by step, including when he first arrived in Irian’s city. Some clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp tells Anna that this case can be ignored. Anna did not show any disappointment. She looked through some information about Amp and the Empire archive. Du Lin’s embarrassment far exceeded that of the masked guy. If it was so simple, Du Lin could be arrested and sent to the cell, forcing the leader to take the initiative. Perhaps Anna had already avenged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you have a long vacation, what are you going to do?" On the way back to Emperor, Anna asked, they each in this department Teams work together when they have tasks, and they can do their own things when there are no tasks. The purpose of asking this question is that Anna hopes that if something unexpected happens, she can find Amp in time. During this time, Anna has already felt the goodness of Amp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of cases analyzed into his hands will soon be able to restore the specific situation at that time, even the analytical ability is a good one. Has become her indispensable assistant, no one. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; AMP looked down at the hands of the cane, "I'm going federal, tucks that line is very important, I have for some time no-show Before he forgets me, I have to wake him up and find something to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Amp and Anna did not Conflict, there is no hard requirement for how to arrange your own life after work. Anyone who returns to the team on time will not ask about their life after work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as Amp left the capital to the Confederacy, Doolin came to the Imperial Capital and Magus wanted to see him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bit boring to come to Emperor Du Lin’s city again to find that he once liked it. It’s not like the city of Otis, all day in a happy atmosphere. It seems a bit depressed here, especially the bad weather, and the sullenness is like some intrigues that are fermenting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were in a coffee shop outside the first boulevard, and when Doolin arrived ten minutes earlier, Magus was already sitting by the window. He was reading his book with his eyes, and he concentrated on it when he arrived at Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He folded the book and put it on the table. Du Lin glanced at it, a book about philosophy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that Du Lin’s curious eyes are noticed, Magus said with a smile: “This book is very interesting, written by a mentally ill person, I have never I didn't think that their world was so interesting. If you have the chance, you can read it." He sent the waiter a cup of flower tea and four sets of cakes. There are no guests around the table, it will not affect them. The conversation will not hear what they are saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat down and looked at Magus. Magus took a piece of cake and took a bite. "I helped you get things down, this You have done a bit too much. No matter how Todd offends you, you should not undermine the rules of the game we obey. Killing is always the next choice, this time your choice is very bad."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the effect is very good!", Du Lin said, "He is not like a mayor, at least he does not look like a mayor should do it." In addition, I need to refute one sentence. In the absence of evidence, I do not admit that I can't admit what I have not done." He smiled and took out a cigarette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus maintains the style of his old-school gentleman, does not show any displeased look, he obviously wants to sell to Du Lin a human, Doolin refused. At the level of Magus, the expression on his face will never reflect his inner real thoughts. He smiled and nodded. "Yes? It turned out that I was wrong!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s reaction made him save some words and talked about another thing, “How was the last time we talked about it?”, he refers to Du Lin’s The big plan, which involves tens of millions of funds, is not a small amount. If you don't trust Du Lin, even if he ran away, he would be able to take him back. It is impossible for these people to invest such a large sum of money in Doolin's plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
