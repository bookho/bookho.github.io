			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are not very busy at hand, I hope that you will come to the Imperial Capital as soon as possible. Some things we need to discuss before we can make a decision."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Kevin said this, Du Lin knew that he thought the phone line was not safe, some words were not suitable for speaking on the phone, and some might involve moving around in gray. Strip things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone at this time is really not so safe. The operator only needs to plug the earphone plug into the monitor port to hear the communication between the two people, even the recording. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin agreed to it, and his current job has nothing more than signing, and he can walk away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will come to the emperor tomorrow night, remember to pick me up, bastard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple Arranged the work at hand, Du Lin went to the Imperial Capital alone, this is the first time he came to the core of the empire, from the moment he stepped on the ground of the Imperial Station, what he saw and heard, Both subverted his understanding of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He arrived at the Imperial Capital at 8:00 in the evening, the entire station was brightly lit, and dozens of huge light bulbs allowed the passengers walking in the station to even have shadows. No. Cleaners everywhere are constantly patrolling their “sites” to ensure that no place is found in the station where there is garbage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the passengers are very polite, even those who are rude, have become polite in this environment and atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not finished yet. The moment that I walked out of the station, a city of bright colors in the darkness suddenly came into my eyes. The bustling is like his dream. The world in it. For a moment, he almost lost in this shocking landscape, and it was not until the moment Kevin ushered in that he came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Is it shocking? When I first came here, I stood here for ten minutes. I was more excited than you. I have been asking myself, is this my future war? Do you know what I thought about at that time?" Du Lin shook his head very well and gave Kevin enough space to play. He turned around. This amazing city with Doolin whispered: "I swear, I want my name to fill every corner of the city. When anyone talks about a lawyer, he will use the name Kevin as a representative. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A great dream, isn't it?", he took out a cigarette and gave Du Lin a "What is your dream?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Du Lin took the cigarette and gathered it in front of Kevin. He lit the cigarette in the fire in his hand. After taking a sip, he spit out, "I?", he smiled with a smile, "One day I will On the hill of the station, put the city in the palm of your hand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, very inspirational, a sinful guy wants to rule the empire, you asked Did Magus haven't?" Kevin patted Du Lin's shoulders, and the two appearances were well-dressed, but the bad pus in the bones went down the steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin’s car is not bad, it’s not a glittering luxury car like the Ringinghouse, but a more stable car. The car's appearance has begun to approach the world's cars in Doolin's dreams, with lower grounds and lower compartments. The black piano lacquered case looks like a heavy, calm feeling, and it doesn't look too old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The firm gave me a special car, they are still a little conscience." After the two got on the bus, Kevin explained that as a pull down of Amp Lawyers, whether he is acquainted or not, are no less than a super earthquake for the lawyer industry. The lawyer from the country has already played the prosecutor's face twice in a row, so that his colleagues have a face on their faces. It is said that due to the conviction of Amp, the fees charged by lawyers have been slightly raised by half a step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin only said that the car is good, his attention is not in the car, but on the street outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After coming out of the station, I entered the city that never sleeps. The street is full of fashionable people, which is not so close to the serious emperor he imagined. In Doolin's imagination, the cultural history and royal style of the emperor should make the city more solemn, rather than the night when the city like Arian, Montrell is awakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go eat something first, then find a place to take a break, and the hearing will come back tomorrow."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this place, Du Lin naturally listened to Kevin's opinion. At Kevin's request, the driver drove to a restaurant outside the Imperial Capital Center, a barbecue restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the restaurant knew Kevin. When he came in, he also took the initiative to say hello and personally took them to a good location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two sat down, Kevin said: "The boss is a Tener, only to be able to eat the most authentic Cannes barbecue, and It’s still Tern’s flavor.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes people always ignore things around them, things that are used to it have become unimportant in people’s eyes, no Too much value. But only after leaving the place where I lived, I left my hometown and went further afield to know how valuable it was to have something that was dispensable. Just because of a name, a gimmick, it is very likely that people will have a sense of intimacy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anticipation, the chef lined up two huge roast beef ribs and explained the boss’s treat, asking them to relax and enjoy Gourmet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at Kevin with amazement. In his impression, Kevin is the kind of buddy when you have money. You don’t have money. When he will be very busy guys, how could such a small shop owner have a relationship? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you helped him through the lawsuit?" Du Lin asked as he placed the napkin under his neckline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin smiled and shrugged his shoulders. "Do you know the term celebrity effect? ​​I am a celebrity now, every time I come here to eat, it equals Is it a good thing to advertise this store, so it’s not normal to eat a little for free?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin suddenly understood, this is a deal, Not human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that the grilled beef ribs of this store are indeed as authentic as Kevin said, and they are full of weight. The shop is not very big, only seven or eight tables, each table is full of people, I can see that the business is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two gorged after eating half a full, slowed down, and Kevin suddenly asked, "Have you ever had a favorite movie?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin rubbed the handkerchief at the table and wiped the greasy hands. He shook his head and said, "I don't watch movies." I thought, "Isn't that part I took myself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin looked disappointed. "I was going to invite you to have a good time. I didn't expect you to give such a face. I believe that Freena is vomiting when you are already familiar. Would you like to try another taste?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s serious opposition: “Please don’t defile the pure friendship between me and Ms. Freina, I am not a person like you!”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to me?" Kevin asked, "If I am a man who pursues some women as a mistake, then everyone in the world will be sentenced." By the way, do you like men?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first half of the sentence, Du Lin’s expression is still normal, and in the latter half he almost picked up the cow. The ribs are on Kevin's head. "Do you want to die this guy? I also like women, and I am fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you prove I see." Kevin took off the napkin on the neckline and stained the oil on his lips. "I didn't even see each time I met." I have seen you looking for fun. To be honest, I really think that you like men. If you don’t want to avoid anything, I will not discriminate against you. This is normal. Everyone has the right to pursue their own preferences. This is what God gives. There is no right or wrong in the gift of mankind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin listened to him quietly, then began to touch his pocket one by one, Kevin immediately put The cigarette pack was taken out and handed over. "Is it a cigarette? Take me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin answered him very seriously, "No, I am looking for a gun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men smashed each other for a while, laughing and screaming and letting each other relax, without a little bit of burden. There is not much time for the two to contact each other. One contact is that one party has trouble, but they are like good friends for decades, saying that they don’t care about each other. Whether it is Kevin or Du Lin, I really cherish this friendship, because this friendship has a special and pure place - money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, Kevin took Du Lin to the biggest dance and dance theater in the Imperial Capital. Just at 9:30, there was a stage play. Kevin bought it. After the ticket, Du Lin walked in and found the seats of the two and sat down. After about five minutes, the lighting was extinguished in the theater and the stage lit up instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said, are you sure I will like this art?", in the dark, Du Lin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
