			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, Mr. Doolin, I may not understand you, you mean...", a farmer with a thick hat stood Looking at the land that has just been sold in the wilderness outside the city, some of them saw the feeling of ghosts. "Do you mean that we don't use pesticides and use our hands to catch bugs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ; The worm is a thing that exists anywhere. It is said that there are some tiny creatures in the cellar. In the open ecological environment of the west, the insects are not much less than people think. The ecological environment here is relatively harsh, and the insects that live here are also very "strong". These gadgets have a powerful overeating ability, and a caterpillar can feed on its own weight from twenty to thirty times its weight in one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They store these foods in their stomachs to get through the possible "famine." Whenever new farmland begins to be cultivated, people are most concerned about the efficiency of pesticides. I don't know when it started, the effective time of the new pesticide was shortened to two or three years. After the aging, the insects will be immersed in the pesticide, of course, and will die, but they are not poisoned and drowned. Therefore, after the spring, people will bring some insects that have been hatched at home, and go to the major pesticide companies in the western sales point to check the efficacy of this year's pesticides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bugs are always very troublesome. Not only is it very troublesome to sprinkle pesticides, it is also very troublesome to do the soaking and disinfection after the pesticides are harvested. The price of vegetables in the west is almost the same as the price of the lowest grade beef, and sometimes it will be higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood in front of a group of farmers and nodded. "Yes, our farmland does not need any pesticides. All the bugs must be done by hand to ensure All crops are not infested with pesticides.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But the workload is so large that we cannot ensure that there are bugs on the back of each leaf. And please forgive me, this will bring more waste. Its practical new pesticides will not cause too much residue, they have special cleaning agents...", the farmer is still talking about this problem, Du Lin raised his hand and prevented him from continuing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I invite you to come and give you a good salary. It is not to discuss with you how I should plant the land. You only need to follow my instructions. This is also the reason why I paid you money.” Du Lin kicked the wild grass under the kick. “You are the best farmer here. I believe that you can help me to take care of these places very beautiful, just let me Satisfied, material rewards often appear in front of you. Now, I hope that you can lead my people and turn all the places here again. Spring is not far away!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the farmers still have some complaints, they can finally compromise with Du Lin’s high salary. No one will ever go with money, whether he is a big man or a small person like a farmer. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers employed by Du Lin are a good farmer in the vicinity, or a farmer from generation to generation, their understanding of the land and the crops. It is definitely more insightful and more reliable than those who enjoy coffee while sitting in the office while enjoying a massage. These people will be the biggest driving force for this piece of land, helping him to plant 500 hectares of land as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty new agricultural vehicles were launched, and local guates and some locals began farming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to the villa, it’s a bit strange. The good mining industry doesn’t do it. How do you think about farming and animal husbandry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His question was quickly answered by Doolin. "The reason is very simple, one is for economic effects, and the other is to kidnap more western locals! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much do you think a sweet cabbage can sell?", sweet cabbage is a cheap vegetable widely grown in the empire, the weight of each one Not equal, most of them are between one kilogram and two kilograms, and the use is quite extensive. It can be used as a main dish for cooking, but more often it is used to make side dishes. For example, hot dogs, burgers and other fast foods as well as barbecue staple foods will use sweet cabbage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha recalled it and tried to answer: "A penny?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and hung the coat on the hanger. "No, my ideal price is very, even higher." He said as he walked inside. "You have to understand that the upper class is very particular about diet, especially It’s the wealthy aristocrats who don’t care if they have eaten ten yuan for a meal, or one hundred. They only care about what they eat enough, and whether they can be the ingredients that set their own worth.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very sweet cabbage and a penny of sweet cabbage, which one do you think they will choose? And we will also pack these sweet cabbages If you look at it, you will be more attracted to the blind people’s blind consumption!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dudu responded instantly, and his unintentional does not mean that he is a fool,” This is why you don't use pesticides to catch people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!", the two walked to the sofa and sat down at random. The family is their own. There is no need to have any shelves. "There is absolutely no pollution of chemicals. Every sweet cabbage is artificially caught. Enjoy separate care, with more scientific sunshine, irrigation and fertilization, there will be people paying for these sweet cabbages. Do you know how many sweet cabbages can be planted in an acre of land?", Buddha shook his head, he is not I understand that Du Lin continued: "An acre of land can grow about 2,600,700, which is counted as 2,500."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, all of Foton had a cold breath, and he was strangely licking the hair on Doolin's head. "How long is your head? If you can do this, you can do it. The income can exceed 200 pieces?", he calculated, 500 hectares a year and three seasons, I am afraid that these incomes are there..., he rubbed his fingers, anyway, millions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is the kind of land, why this guy’s brain can think of things that others can’t think of, so the matter that says the brain is still handed over to Doolin. Let's go! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dudu suddenly lost the motivation to continue to explore, Du Lin did not continue. In fact, the money is not what he cares the most. What he cares most is how many people can be kidnapped by these land. If an acre of land can accommodate ten people for work, then one hectare is one hundred and fifty, and five hundred hectares is seventy-five thousand. Seventy-five thousand people in the South or the East Coast may occupy only a few percent to a dozen percent of a city's employment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the west, a city has a population that does not exceed one million at most. According to the cities with a population of 50,000 or 600,000, this can almost satisfy a city. The need for jobs. In other words, as long as you can ensure that these farming and animal husbandry can save the salary of these people. By the time all the farms are fully rolled out in the west, it can be said that Du Lin will become the "boss" of most people in the west. More than 30 to 40 percent of the people here are his employees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, he has the final say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this thing should be dug in the mine. The mining area is far more profitable than farming and animal husbandry, with less burden, less expenditure, and more stable income. It can help Du Lin to make up for the economic pressure of over-employing farmers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers on the farm are doing their best, and it’s almost in February, the tail of the winter is looming, the pace of spring is already ringing, and people are also Beginning to take off the thick coat, even in the desolate west, there is a vivid view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
