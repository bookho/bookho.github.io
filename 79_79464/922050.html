			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Buck said that he wanted to be a core member, Du Lin’s first reaction was to look at Dove. His understanding of Dove far exceeds his understanding of Buck, and the character of Dove is definitely not to let Buck become their core member. Although everyone is ignoring one thing, the fact is the fact that Dove has become a member of Doolin’s core circle unconsciously. She knows too many things, so she will stop Buck from falling into this weird circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deve's lips moved, and finally bowed her head, she wanted to say no, but Buck's eyes gave her a feeling of not being able to say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are expectations, threats, enthusiasm, and hate, very complicated. She has never seen so many contradictory emotions in the eyes of a person, and this person is still her relatives, her brother. She did not know how to choose, she also hesitated and hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin walked all the way around her, almost accompanied by Du Lin, watching him start from running a jewelry store, step by step to become the mayor of today Three years is very short, and he has achieved such an achievement. If he does not encounter an insurmountable mountain in the future, then which step can Du Lin take? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps as he said, to become the prime minister of the empire? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw too much during Du Lin’s life as a steward, and she knew that this night was a fateful choice, a chance was there. She is holding in her hand. As long as you hold it tight, the next stop may be heaven, but it may also be an abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as she grasps this opportunity, her future brother, her brother and even her brother, will represent the rise of a family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a social bottom for so long, Dove also wants to smell the smell of the mountain, is it really so fresh, so charming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not long before she hesitated, Du Lin understood it. He smiled and clicked. “Exactly, we are going to discuss something at night, maybe still There is a place for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck’s excited face flushed, he waved his fist a little, just like discussing the human with his girlfriend for the first time. After the origins, it seems that every cell in the body is cheering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duff shook his head and walked silently into the kitchen, started making dinner for Doolin, and made some snacks. These people must have been discussing for a long time tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kevin?", Du Lin looked at it, didn't see Kevin, and all pointed to the position of the study on the second floor. Du Lin took a picture. Put Buck on the shoulder and let the young man immediately lift his chest. "Go and call Kevin. Let's talk about something before eating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bark soon I took Kevin down, everyone sat together, and Du Lin asked Hite to close the windows and doors, and then gave a light breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been able to confirm that the person who made the counterfeit coin to attack us is the mayor of Nano Lindes, Mr. Todd.", Du Lin's subconscious 掏After a box of cigarettes, I took one and left it on the table. He did not immediately ignite. "The rapid growth of the city of Otis is harmful to Nano Lindes. Once the two railways are repaired, Nano Lindes will lose at least 60% of its fiscal revenue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Plus our constant investment, some will be in Nano Lindes The merchants who bought the property attracted, and the economy of Nano Lindes will decline rapidly. This is definitely a heavy blow to him. I heard people say that his latest appearance indicated that he will run for the post of governor four years later. In the past four years, the economic growth of Nam Lindes and the people's livelihood have experienced a rapid recession. He has no chance to get everyone's votes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People will not Bring a person who does not even have a mayor to the governor’s position, He must do something, whether for himself or for Nano Lindes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took the cigarette and let the cigarette filter face down, The coffee table was smashed twice. Because of the increase in tobacco taxes, many cigarette rolls are loose in tobacco, and there is even a joke that slides out of a tube of tobacco. These tobacco companies have kept their profits without raising prices by doing a little trick from the cigarettes themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two rounds, the tobacco on the cigarette butt in Du Lin’s hand was obviously retracted into the pipe, and he took out the lighter and took a deep breath. "I believe that they will not admit that they have done these things anyway, but things must be solved. If they do not destroy those machines and templates, they mean they can continue to make tokens anytime, anywhere. So we need I gave Mr. Todd a taste of it. He had been the mayor for too long, so that he forgot that something could not be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin pinched his chin and inserted a sentence, "Don't talk to him first? Maybe he will compensate you for your loss!", after he finished, he will be happy first, everyone's eyes are focused on him. On the body, he smiled and said, "Okay, no kidding. Actually, I can't help you anything, but I would like to make a suggestion. It is best to talk about it first. If Todd does not want to apologize for the loss, then we only need to catch It’s okay to live in a guy called Louis...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his hand to stop Kevin from continuing, he knew Kevin wanted What to say, "I am very sorry that Kevin can solve this problem by way of a lawsuit, but I can't make it a sign that warns everyone. I believe you will be able to make them feel bad in court. But those bystanders? Such punishments are not even punishment for these people. As long as they don't die, they have nothing to lose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So...", Du Lin chuckled twice. We want to be clean and let him understand that although I am a mayor like him, the essence is different between us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin Brother, what do you say? Who kills?", Savi slaps up a sleeve and you make me who I do. When he was a child, he was the most worshipped Buddha. Although he said that he did not go to school, he was mixed with the gangs outside, and he often came back with injuries. However, he brought light to the family, even if the faint wind blows out, it will be extinguished, but after all, everyone will come safely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These brothers and sisters, they used the life of the Buddha to fill their stomachs and eat and see a doctor. There is no Buddha and his fight on the street in those years, maybe they have already died halfway. Perhaps it is death from hunger, or death from disease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, he began to worship Du Lin, Du Lin is more than Dudu, but everything he did was bigger than those that Dudu had done. More exciting. What's more important is that Du Lin is very fair – it's only effective for his talents. He doesn't care what he does, even if he knows that he can die for Doolin. Go and see the streets of Tener. Countless people are willing to fight for Doolin and are willing to fight for him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pressed him back according to Savi’s shoulders. “Several gang leaders on the side of Nano Lindes are now also city investors, from They got a little news from them...", Du Lin suddenly turned and said a thank you, took a cup and took a sip. "Todd has a wife, two daughters, and he has several mistresses outside, including The two mistresses need to pay attention to the fact that the two women have children around them, which may be Todd's species."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has no loved ones himself. It is said that a disease has occurred in Nano Lindes many years ago. His family members have died in the disease..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Kea couldn't help but ask: "If his family died, how did he survive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at him, "He At that time, he was working as a servant for Count Linders, and lived in the castle.", he continued with the words above: "There are a lot of security guards in his villa, about 20 people, and there are people coming and going. In addition to the municipal In addition to the team's team, he also has a former secretary, who is now working for him, and a guy named Louis, who may be his illegitimate child, to help him explore the privacy of local high-ranking people."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Du Lin said that this was just a chat before dinner, but when it was said After talking for more than an hour, when it was almost the same time, Dove just "caught" them into the restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck was shocked and numb throughout the process, and then began to get excited. This is the life he longs for. He is finally not the one who is bragging himself and his friend Du Lin is a good friend in Irian and he has really integrated himself. Although it is still a bit uncomfortable to just join the group to discuss killing, but he has tried to accept these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinner is very rich, except for Du Lin’s one, which is cooked by Defu himself, and the other is a semi-finished product ordered from the outside restaurant in the afternoon. Add some heat and sprinkle some spices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people took a break after eating and watched TV. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha returned to the George family after the Empire Star is currently managed by Nasha’s secretary, her ability Du Lin has seen, let the company work step by step There is no problem. The reason why they did not change these people was to better let the George family fall into the tank he prepared according to Doolin's plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to some interesting things happening in the mid-term elections, the most interesting TV content is probably the funny faces of those familiar faces. The cold jokes that don’t speak the ground interpret each other’s plots. However, this TV series, which Dulin seems to be "terrible", has received unanimous praise. There are also federal calls to hope to order 1,000 sets from the first period. There are also many people who like it. This way of expressing content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
