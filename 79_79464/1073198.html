			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taylor is highly educated and has always considered himself to be one of the best executors of the word "elite" in newspapers and social commentary. The outstanding social skills made him enter the imperial Central Bank of the Empire to start his career as soon as he left the school, so he knew the word and knew a lot of words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After watching the two trembling arms are still trembling documents, Taylor's heart has sunk into the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very complete and complete patent application approval report and a legally valid patent protection application, including not only the approval documents of the Patent Office. There is also approval from the Ministry of Justice, which has full legal benefits and is protected by imperial law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is just an ordinary patent certificate, Taylor will throw it into the trash most of the time after reading it, just like he used to see those who have arrived in retirement. In the case of the application for retirement and pensions, the same amount of painstaking efforts have been thrown into the garbage. But at this moment, he can't do it. This is the patent certificate for business service patents. The most important ones are simple and straightforward covering the most important nature of the insurance business industry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s bastard actually registered the business one step ahead, and the more idiotic people were those of the patent office and the Ministry of Justice. Didn’t they know that there was no entity? Is registration very dangerous? If someone registers the air, does every living person pay the “breathing fee” or infringement fee to the patent owner? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jerked his head up and looked at Doolin, but Du Lin did not look at him, but looked at the people who were distributing documents throughout the conference hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial central bank invites these people to come here to witness this historic moment, proving that the value and role of these people will cover most of the industries and fields in society, as long as They can understand the words on the document, and they should know that the establishment of the so-called insurance industry self-discipline committee is a big joke, along with the initiators and organizers. No matter what role the Southern Commercial Bank and the Imperial Central Bank played before, now they are harlequins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ladies and gentlemen, you absolutely can’t believe how much when I heard that some people tried to compete with me for the power that belongs to me in a fait accompli Surprisingly, this act of blatant trampling of the law happened in the sun, and what surprised me even more is that these people actually have prestige and status that are unimaginable. They are Mr. Berito of the Southern Commercial Bank and the Central Bank of the Empire. Mr. Taylor!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm not sure if there are two big banks behind them, or it's just their personal behavior, but illegal things are illegal after all, not because some people have more social resources to own. More financial resources, knowing more powers can reverse black and white."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and glanced at Taylor, who stood under the stage, laughing and said, "I know that Mr. Taylor must have a lot to say to me, but I am sorry, when you decided to use this shameful way to infringe on my rights, I took the initiative to cut off the way we negotiated." Du Lin also spoke about the things Taylor had done before. "I heard that Mr. Taylor is so familiar with the law that many people are afraid to go to court with him after he has violated his rights. I just want to try one. Try, Mr. Taylor is not as powerful as he is!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Du Lin gave a moment to pay tribute to the audience, then turned to the host. Take people to the door. His purpose has been reached today, so that everyone knows that the so-called insurance industry self-discipline committee is simply a joke, and he also let more people know that the insurance business is now his exclusive business, want to contact the industry to find No one can use it, only Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Du Lin and Magus talked about the insurance industry and extended a new problem - the federal sound and advanced social welfare protection The system has always been the object of study in all countries. In the past two years, there have been some voices in the empire, and it is believed that the most basic social welfare security system, namely the pension insurance system and the medical insurance system, should be launched. The initiators believe that an imperial citizen who lost his ability to work after working for the country for several decades has correspondingly lost the power to survive in society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no new economic source, and it will inevitably become the burden of the family and even the burden of the whole society. The contradiction between the rich and the poor will be sharper. There will be more deadly problems. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the current empire has a relatively mature pension system, the so-called enterprise pension system, an employee who works for a lifetime can retired Getting a large pension is enough for employees to not fall into a stalemate due to economic problems after retirement, and finally lose the power to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge risk in the corporate pension system, although many companies are repeatedly repeating the insurance to the hands of every retire, but this Commitment is not always possible. What happens to employees who have reached the red line once the company has a problem and is facing bankruptcy? It is difficult for them to find a suitable job, and even if they find it, they cannot guarantee that they will have the basic conditions for survival after retirement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the pension system is also a heavy burden for enterprises. If an ordinary enterprise suddenly has a retiring tide in the process of declining performance, then a huge pension will kill this well-run enterprise. It is impossible to pay for the embarrassing situation that may eventually even lead to bankruptcy. In order to avoid this, entrepreneurs and capitalists are likely to choose to evade when faced with these problems - split their own corporate retention liabilities, and then let this part of the explosion with the employees who are on the verge of retirement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of similar situations in the society. The imperial central bank is the most obvious case. Among them, Taylor has played a very disgraceful role. He kicked out a group of employees who were about to retire by looking for problems and even finding faults, and saved at least millions of dollars or more for the imperialist central bank. He also allowed him to go from an ordinary bank. The top level has become a partner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this responsibility should be shared by the whole society, and should not be allowed to do business, no matter how well the company does well, it is unfair. Let the imperial official take the lead and form an effective and effective institution to ensure that every imperial citizen will not lose the power and conditions for survival when he loses his ability to work and lose his job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not a very good thing to do. The best performance in this regard is the federal, federal people’s universal welfare system that existed since they founded the country. It is. After years of generations of adherence and observance, it has become a habit for everyone to pay various guarantees every month. The federal government is also very good at packaging. It is indeed done for most people after they are old. They can continue to live without requiring quality of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, federal people can take about 40% of the salary of 300 federal shields per month to pay various insurance benefits, but Can an empire be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a dozen or so 20 pieces a month to pay various fees, I am afraid they are willing to starve to death and are not willing to pay this part of the cost. Moreover, the huge wage gap in the region has made this policy difficult to implement. The ordinary working class in the south has a salary of more than 60 yuan a month, but in the west, the most dangerous one is the one with the highest wage. There are only fifty. Then will it cause southerners, easterners and northerners to go to the west to pay insurance premiums? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these people need to honor their welfare, what standards should they follow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
