			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How? Is there any gain this time?", Xiun irritated and took out a box of cigarettes from his pocket to point to himself, and then remembered What, and took out another one to give another detective in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few months, Xiu En had no sense of enthusiasm when he first took the post of the Director of the Prohibited Goods Administration. He looked a lot, if not refined. The clothes and the decent dress, I am afraid I will regard him as the former grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of the Bureau of Prohibition is not good. The biggest problem is that he has been working in the field before, and you want him to arrest individuals and investigate some cases. Very capable, but let him and a group of politically-born officials to compete in the framework of the rules, he is still far from enough. For example, in the case of the present, the object of the investigation is the famous private wine tycoon Karur in the city of Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the death of Ernst, when Du Lin was in prison, he completely ruled the smuggling market in the city of Tener, his words are the rules, his emotions It’s the market. If he is happy, he may have unlimited supply of wine at night. If he is angry, sorry, all the bar's high-alcohol will enter the limited supply stage, and the price will become higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge wealth brought to the amazing wealth of Karur, when the wealth is more than a certain degree, enough to interfere with politics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, now that Xiu Ming knows almost everything in Karur, but he has no evidence to bring Carul to justice. After several times, he could touch Carol's ass, but he was always successfully escaped at the crucial moment. This made Zion once suspect that someone inside the Bureau of Investigation sold out internal information for money. He sorted out the investigation bureau twice, but found nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agent who broke into the Karur smuggling group yesterday sent back information, saying that Karur had to pick up the goods at the dock, and that there were thousands of boxes on three cargo ships. Smuggling wine, time is two o'clock in the middle of the night. After receiving this news, Xiun immediately organized a team of 12 people in the investigation bureau that he believed to be the most trustworthy, and brought them two automatic rifles, so they must obtain evidence. The reason why he did not personally lead the team was because when he was preparing to lead the team personally, an informant told him that there was a secret warehouse in the suburbs where Karel hides private liquor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he did several times before, he was once again emptied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empty streets on the edge of the city are empty, and several huge warehouse doors are open. When he goes in, there is nothing in the warehouse, except for some remaining on the ground. Glass shards and a rich aroma of wine in the air. After escaping again, he pinned all his hopes on another team. The first time he returned to the investigation bureau, he called the agent responsible for the action last night to the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you look at the agent who is silent and silent, he feels a little uncomfortable in his heart. He does not believe in evil and asks, " Did you catch someone? Goods? If you have the goods, you can!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detective in front of him snorted and said sorry, "We are Waiting for the night on the dock, nothing was found. The person who did not receive the goods, the cargo ship that did not deliver the goods, did not even have a ghost shadow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He squeezed it and tried to wave it up, and slowly let it go. He knows that this has nothing to do with his detectives. He has been so many times. The intelligence is true and false, and most of them look fake. Even if some are true, they will end up being late for a variety of reasons. He didn't understand where the problem was, why Karur was like knowing what he was going to do, and avoiding it every time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He patted the detective’s shoulder and comforted a few words. “Our enemy is very embarrassed. We will try many times before we catch him. The failure, but I believe that the prey can no longer escape the hunter's pursuit. As long as he reveals a flaw, he will lose everything, all our efforts will get the full return in the end!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Working well, this is not your fault, bring my words to all the members!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detectors leave After Xiu En closed the door, he went to the window and looked at the city hall at the end of the street not far away. He had a vague idea. He always could not catch Karur, and he must The vested interests in this city are related. Whether it is a member of parliament, a mayor, a police station, a fire station, a medical and education security bureau... almost everyone is standing in opposition to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this city, the police are staring at him, the gangs on the street are staring at him, even at this moment, some hiding in the dark The man is watching him standing behind the glass window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoky blue smoke rises, he squints slightly, how can he break? If everyone is staring at him, not letting these people lose control of information and intelligence, and can't hide themselves, how can he catch Karur? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shen has felt great pressure, pressure comes from the constant inquiries from the mayor, the expectations of the governor and his own pressure on himself. He took a deep breath and threw the already-burning cigarette butts on the ground and grinded it with his toes. Since it is not possible to follow the rules, then do not follow the rules! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Du Lin, who spent a hundred days in prison in a peaceful life, was finally released from prison. Being able to get out of prison in advance is also thanks to the Warden’s “care”, and he applied to the State Prison Administration Office for Du Lin and others to apply for a commutation and passed. The warden can't stand it anymore. The family's life has been shackled in the hands of others. At the same time, the prisoners have been "suddenly dead" and "accidents" frequently. Some people have questioned his management level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prison is a vertical management system, it is difficult for people outside the system to interfere with things within the system, but people in the system want to interfere and simply It is. In order to prevent Du Lin from making things that made him more passive during the last time, he simply sent them out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time in prison and the first time he was released, Du Lin had a special sense of accomplishment. He looked back at the closed iron gate and smiled. Shoot the shoulders of Buddha. Although this trip is somewhat dangerous, it is good that there is basically no big problem. Now it is his turn to make a move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside world has been sent to Doolin through some channels during this time. He knows that he and Dudu are safe. The mayor’s entire energy was involved in the body of Xien, and there was no time or energy to care about the fate of his little man. At the same time, he also had a rough guess about the man who might be behind the scenes. Now he has to do a good meal, then grab the man who is behind him behind him, and then find the one. He took a whole hundred days of juggling guys to settle accounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three cars in the distance quickly approached the prison and stopped at a place not far from Doolin. After getting out of the first car, Ellis couldn't help but smile and breathe a sigh of relief. During this time he was breathing free air outside, but he was the most tired person in the fellowship. Not only do you need to collect intelligence, but you should also find people who continue to pay attention to Doolin as much as possible with limited resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
