			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the restaurant manager and a violin player came over, the restaurant manager was a little surprised at the two people sitting at the table are men - sisters The two stood on one side and there were no seats on this table. They were not qualified to sit here. But the manager is not at all surprised. As the feminist movement is getting more and more popular, a large number of women stand up to fight for their rights and interests, and some inexplicable rights organizations have emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are non-profit civil organizations such as the “Gay Alliance”, who constantly promote the truth, goodness and beauty of homosexuality and call on everyone to look at homosexuality with equal and normal eyes. Although this statement and practice itself puts itself in an abnormal position, there are always people who buy it and feel that this is the right thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love who is the freedom of others, even if a person falls in love with a donkey, as long as he can get the consent of the blind, even if the cross-ethnic exchange of body fluids is allowed - This is another content of the liberating nature of the organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Vicki had a young man... Then the restaurant manager recognized Du Lin, who had no sound and still stood silently at the table. side. Vicki stunned his face. He wanted to interrupt this embarrassing process, but he felt very interesting. He never tried such awkward situation, and he had an inexplicable expectation, just like I saw a funny play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melodious violin sound began to sound, and Doolin has realized that there is something wrong with it, because this is a very famous piece, famous for him." The illiterate "knows the name of this song - "Dedication to my favorite person", many times the wedding will play this track to set off a romantic atmosphere. But the two men are sitting here... Is it a basis? Du Lin’s heart was suddenly cold, and he became somewhat restless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a pair of lovers standing in front of the god of love, praying for the gift of love...", the original text should be a pair of men and women, the restaurant manager responded quickly Men and women have become lovers, but this can only make the atmosphere even more strange. As he tells a famous epic about beautiful love, he puts the red candle on the table and points it. After that, the lights over the table became dim, and if it weren't for two men at the table, it would be very romantic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sweet and greasy violin and the whisper of the restaurant manager, the waiter placed a piece of food one by one on the table, and finally the chef performed The restaurant's specialties, the sudden fire can not see the food in the plate, as the flame gradually dissipated, the center-shaped steak of the plate exudes a seductive scent in the plate. What's more, this steak is divided into two halves, half given to Vicki and half to Du Lin, who called the dish "the other half." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Vecchi couldn't help it. Suddenly he laughed loudly, and Du Lin was amused. He seemed to understand something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the good wishes of the restaurant manager, including the cook and others left, leaving only the violinist standing on the side and pulling the moving melody. The restaurant manager returned to the office. He considered dialing a phone call again and gave a reply after the price was negotiated at 150. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside, Du Lin pulled out a twenty-dollar bill to the violinist, thanked him for leaving, and heard again blessing. The two sisters have gone to the bathroom, and Du Lin can fully imagine how happy they are now laughing in the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unexpected thing, but I have to say that after the very cola after the smashing, Vicki has laughed a little short, and Du Lin is also miserable. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't have a dinner!" He said very sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicette laughed a few more times before the laughter gradually stopped. He drank a swig of wine and sat sideways on the chair, not at all high society. Decent people when dining, "I can explain, in fact, I had a girl at night, your phone is not the time, I just want to solve it here by the way, forgot to tell them to change the menu and program, you Do you believe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said with a nod. "This makes me feel better. At least I can continue to talk to you instead of standing up and running away, but I have to say that this is the most embarrassing and interesting meal I have ever experienced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicker raised the glass slightly, "I am, for this We should have a drink for a unique dinner.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wrong program did not ruin the mood of two people, but made them feel that it was fun and more casual. Some, "I will discuss with the council about the agreement, but You know that all the shareholders of the Imperial Bank add up to more than 5,000 people. There are also many members who have the title of chairman. If you want me to fully fulfill all the agreements, you must come up with convincing things.", officially entered the working state. The Wichi became another person. He ate a half heart-shaped steak and said, "You want them to see the necessity and prospects of doing so, as long as they can convince more than two-thirds of the directors." There is no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the agreement, the imperial central bank must cooperate with Doolin's series of operations, and bear most of the funds, which is related to the operation of hundreds of millions of dollars or more. It is definitely not a paper agreement that allows the central bank to perform. If the risk is too great, the central bank is willing to tear up the agreement, and it will be a big deal to continue the lawsuit. Anyway, the imperial central bank has money and leisure, and some people and Du Lin continue to slap the skin. It is better to lose a little money when it is great. It is better than more losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement, the contract is not too binding for an economy that is too large, when the gain is greater than the loss, when the risk is greater than the profit At the time, tearing up the agreement is the most correct choice, and they can afford to pay for it anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin knows that this is not going to be easy, so he talked about the second thing, "As for the other thing, I have three Condition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicker put down the knife and fork in his hand and sat down with a napkin and dipped his mouth. "Please say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, no less than 100 million in cash, you will arrive before September."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken After thinking about it for a while, I nodded. "I can be the master, there is no problem." The reason why he has a frowning action is not because Du Lin wants too much money, but raises it in one breath. The large amount of funds has a great impact on the financial data of the imperial central bank in the last fiscal quarter, and some of the business may have to be temporarily suspended, which will make the financial report a bit ugly, which may have some uncertain effects. Of course, some of the effects are also within the control range, but this is a trouble, and Vip is annoying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Second, when I need it, at least I will borrow more than 300 million yuan in cash, I will use the real estate of Otis as a mortgage." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This request is very quick, because it will not be a problem, the city of Otis has developed faster and better in recent years. The newly appointed mayor did not challenge the "Dulin Rules" of Otis as his predecessor did, which gave him the affirmation of Doolin, plus the speciality of the city of Otis, the real estate of Du Lin. The value is growing exponentially. Having these things as collateral is actually a good thing for the imperial central bank. Vicki has even begun to expect that Doolin will not pay the money and has to hand over the real estate to the bank for principal and interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Third, I need at least one in ten thousand shares of the Imperial Bank, of course not for me, but for two girls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This It’s not a problem. There is not much one-tenth of the shares. This is relatively speaking. Vicki gave a reply directly. “There is no problem at all. This one-tenth of the shares can be taken from me. According to the market price." He said with a smile. "Do you like the two girls? I think we have a lot of the same places. If there is a chance, we should have more contact."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicker mistakenly believes that Doolin wants this one-tenth of the shares to be happy for the girl, which is what he often does, such as this dinner tonight, and his practice on weekdays. . He felt that Du Lin and he were very close to each other. They were friends who could play together. He likes to make new friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s request is over, this time it’s Vervin’s turn to ask, “So, what can you pay for these things?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not hesitate to give a more favorable bargaining chip than to the Southcomer. "Thirty percent of the patent rights, if you want more, Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicker shook his head. "No, all we need is a ticket. We don't care if it's an ordinary ticket, or there is When can I sign a high-level membership ticket for a dedicated channel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tomorrow is OK, but I need to add a small request, that is, don’t The society announced the agreement between us." At the South Commercial Bank, Du Lin forgot about this matter and made his small plan a little volatile. Now he still has to make this request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victure has no reason to refuse, and he also has a request, that is, the three lawsuits do not need to wait for the final judgment, which will make the central bank lose face, they can Court settlement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a solution to Du Lin’s sigh of relief, and the girls returned from the bathroom. They deliberately avoided it and let them say some more in-depth topics. This is very good, and people who are sensible will make people more like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of people ended the meal just after leaving the restaurant door and felt the glare of the silver light extinguished for a moment, a sitting in the car that had already started The reporter put away the camera and shook the window. He could see that he was very excited. This would definitely be a big news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
