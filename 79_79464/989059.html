			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What you have to do involves the interests of many people, not necessarily done, and!", Barr shrugged his shoulders, "If anyone knows you The plan may try every means for you to bring your plan into the coffin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus smiled, he looked up and looked like the sun The sun, looking back at Bar, "If it is true, I will untie all the constraints on Doolin and let him tear off all the people who are blocking him."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sometimes I admire him, not only because of his youth, he has more time to realize his dreams, I am more envious of his behavior! He wants to do, he will go Do, even if you want to do things, do it well, this is a terrible force. He has no fear of this society, the empire, the whole world. I guess he must think that he can overcome everything, so he It will become what we all appreciate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There are a lot of things I want to do, too many, I can't count them. But I told myself that these are things I can't do because I don't know what the consequences will be after I do. I can't Do, because I can't afford the burden of building after the destruction... We have too much helplessness, not because we have too little power, but because we understand awe and learn to restrain ourselves."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When a dog sees a lion, it will be scared of urine, and the wild dog will be mad at the face of the lion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But Du Lin, he dared to rush to bite the lion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hope, everything can be as smooth as planned! Anyone I don't want this empire to go in an unknown direction, at least I am!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of capital power is not a problem in the Yaoxing Empire, the whole West The world is facing such problems, but some places look very good - for example The state, the country itself is built on the soil of capital to capital strength has been transformed into a means of management, they have very skilful, with the capital to suppress the capital. Looking at the top of the federal government, almost all of them are big capitalists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the owner of a family, is the representative of a consortium, they first enjoy the benefits of capital, and then use this force to target others . But there is also a drawback in it, that is the class problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federation seems to be more free than the empire. It seems that there is no class problem, but it is not. Class problems still exist in the Union and are more serious than the social structure within the Empire. When all the power and power are equal to the money, it means a more horrible, interest group after the class solidifies. These people, who can be called the top of the federation, will try to avoid the most severe counterattacks against those challengers in order to avoid losing their status as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have more money, and it is actually very easy to eliminate those challengers, because there is a trick in the capital market called this wounded, With far more than the opponent's innumerable capital strength, the gambling of the other side, failed many times for the high-level is just a little skin injury. But as long as they succeed, they will make people who challenge themselves into the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run, the beautiful freedom and the initiative in the hands of ordinary people will become a joke, a big joke. The thoroughly solidified top class will be absolutely decaying, they will reject any form of change, and all the changes will be stifled in order to ensure their own interests. When the federation is at its peak, that is, when they begin to destroy, and this day is not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Magus hopes to explore a way forward for the empire. He doesn’t need a solidified class. What he needs is full of variables, spurs and motivation. Class. When the ruling party can't bring happiness to people, people will be civilized and rational enough to let him step down, not by means of force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually a big plan that should lag behind. Maggs has already understood very well that he has no means of restricting the expansion of capital power. He is now I changed my mind a little. This change was that he read a book from a sociologist in the Kingdom of Cyrus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sociologist simply clarified the essence of capital - the undisguised pursuit of desire. When you have one, you will consider having ten. When you have ten, you will want to have more and more than everyone else. The expansion of capital is actually the release process of human desire itself. It is just that people turn this instinct into a more simple and clear means, and then seek to satisfy their own desires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sociologist put forward a hypothesis in the book, if the social problem is introduced into an infinite loop, that is, continuous construction and destruction, through more The power to control this cycle may be the best constraint on capital power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every once in a while, large capitalists will go bankrupt, and the money they hold will flow back into society. The unevenness in this redistribution will create some prominent people. Become a representative of the new capitalist and re-enter the top of society. Then continue this cycle of infinite loops. When the top level of the tower rises, it breaks it and lets the society make another choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a certain social class reset in countless years, a true fairness in the pursuit of people will be born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above are the illusions of the fart and the scholars without going through the head, but Magus thinks that these shit still have some practical meaning, for example, the interior of the empire has now begun to solidify. A class, a large consortium with a noble origin. These centuries have accumulated more than the collective strength of society, and their personal connections and influence on society have left them with no natural enemies. With the view of the sociologist, Magus has a less mature idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn the so-called cycle into a food chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A complete food chain like a circle, once a link has expanded, the upper ring will be greatly replenished by the expansion of the next ring. Then the layers progress and finally return to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s hard to do, it’s always just a concept, because everyone knows that social structures are always tower-shaped, not circular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now what he has to do is try to complete this masterpiece, first to break the most complicated, most difficult to attack, almost solidified aristocratic capitalist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he needs to face in this process, that is, the group’s biggest vested interests, they will defend their own interests and dare to attack those who intend to harm them. People, including his prime minister, will not be seen by them. So now he needs a person like Du Lin, a mad dog, and then points him in a direction, let him bite all the way and attract firepower for himself, which hopes to perfect his conception of social structure as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I arrange after Du Lin runs out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God may give him the answer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fifth day of the Otis City Parade, Donald finally appeared in front of the people. He stood on the steps of the square outside the town hall, facing the crowds of the parade, the voices in the cold wind through the megaphone to make all People can hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The great Otis city miracle creators, today I am standing here facing all of you, there are many words to say."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that every Audis is a person who loves peace and loves life. We should not and cannot make our life unpredictable because of the arrangement of a few people. The change. I know that everything that happened recently has something to do with me, but I hope that everyone can understand the nature of my decisions, definitely not to hurt any one of you. I hope that everyone will be better, let It is even more prosperous and makes the city of Otis even better!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there are some people who are willing to drag everyone down to hell, not willing to let me, Bring the good to everyone. I hope that everyone can handle it all sensibly, and in these few days, I have found a solution. On behalf of the City Hall, I will expand the city of Otis!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And in the connection In the coming month, the City Hall will provide no less than 150,000 jobs for those who have lost their employment environment. This number will continue to increase..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a house opposite the Town Hall Square, the members of the Otis business group headed by Selem are gathered here. They listen to the sound from the window and their face is gradually dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seilem looked at the "little man" on the square in the distance, snorted and he turned and looked at the big guy. "Is it heard?" Donald and the hymn consortium reached an agreement that the hymn consortium will be fully responsible for the second phase of the Otis city construction plan. They intend to double the city circle..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This news can be said to be the latest news. After Mr. Donald and Mr. Old Cape made a phone call, the intention of "cooperation" between the two sides was confirmed. For the Cape family, this will not hinder their next development plan. The original plan to cooperate with the Fatima family to build the import and export SAR will continue, and will also make concessions to the Fatima family in the cooperation. Their initial plan was to make no less than 35 percent of the plan, and try to get as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
