			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Doolin’s dream, the guy who always faces him often tells his men in one sentence, which is called “the narrow road meets” "The brave wins!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't want to be a stepping stone for others, then turn others into your own stepping stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of fate sometimes loves a lucky one, but most of the time it is relatively fair. She gave the opportunity to everyone, but can she see the opportunity, can not seize the opportunity, and has little to do with her. In another world, a cobbler—a cobbler who specializes in doing boots for merchants and nobles, and dealing with stinky scorpions all day, seized the opportunity and changed his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be short-lived, but at least he has blossomed for a thousand years or even eternal glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, it is Dulin’s chance. He will not let go of this opportunity, as long as he wipes out Wood, in the city of Tener, he will certainly occupy a place. Maybe someone else will slow him down because of his lack of knowledge and accumulation, but this is not important to him. He only needs people to fear him and does not need people to respect him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fearing him, he will obey his words, obey his instructions, and be his lamb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respect him, but it will inevitably question him, and sometimes he will oppose him, and will become the stone in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Wood must die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killing spread from the downstairs to the upstairs, the thugs who were squeezed on the stairs were desperate, they found their opponents this time, and they had met before Those are not the same at all. They don't yell and yell when they fight, squirting dirty words to inspire their morale and insult others. They are born as killings, silent and efficient killers. Every sharp knife will inevitably break into the enemy's vitality. Every time I cut it, it is aimed at the enemy's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, they are not afraid of death, one by one like a sweet and bloody, hungry little prodigal son. They simply don't know what is scary, they just want to taste the flesh and blood of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brand new truck drove out from the side of the alley. This was the truck that Du Lin bought from the only truck sales company in the city of Tener four days ago. It is also the most common "Hero 50" model on the market. Truck. The reason why a truck will have such a name is that during the War of the Imperial War, the steam locomotive railway on the front line was severely damaged, and the supply and backup could not be transported to the front line through the steam locomotive. At that time, the commander-in-chief of the army had to compulsory to requisition a large number of trucks, carrying a batch of soldiers and supplies from the rear to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to official statistics, each truck of this model, together with the driver and the co-pilot, can be inserted into up to fifty people, almost as a person The goods are coded inside. After the war ended, when the Prime Minister delivered a speech in the capital, he once said with eloquence that it was because of the transportation and security of the truck that the war ended in victory as planned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the hero in the truck, the hero's truck! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this truck was renamed by the manufacturer and became the Hero 50. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truck slowly drove to the door of the company, and several young people immediately lifted the body on the ground and threw it in. There are more and more corpses that are constantly accumulating. Even when the blood in the gap of the car begins to bleed outward, the internal killing sound of the company gradually stops. A corpse was carried out by young people. If no one was thrown into the truck, when the last one had not breathed, and the injured hitter gave a slight mourning, they all walked over and inserted the sharp knife into him. Chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car was carrying a car body and more than a dozen injured guys and several fellow members who could no longer stand up and sailed outside the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is a general cleaning. The girls, the boys cleaned the blood on the road with water, and the blood inside the company splashed everywhere. Was erased. Some places where there were traces of fighting were smashed with a 30-pound sledgehammer. If you don't care about the pink water that is constantly integrated into the sewer, perhaps no one will find it. There has been a fight and more than 30 people have died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the general cleaning, the city patron saint of Trine, Mr. Prando finally walked under the support of two powerful police officers. A sigh of relief pulled over. He rubbed his hand and wiped the sweat from his face, and relieved with a sigh of relief. "This ghost weather is so hot...", his eyes curiously looked towards the building behind Du Lin, not gathered in The gangs who pulled the sword together, there was no bloody and bloody wounded, all the scenes he had seen, imaginable, none. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to say... Wood came to revenge? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just wanted to greet Du Lin, Du Lin walked into the alley, about three times, he changed a suit and walked out. The mask was also removed. Prando's eyes glimpsed, and there was a feeling of entanglement in his heart. He knew what Dulin did for this. He also had to admire Doolin's care and caution, and his wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Prando noticed a detail, and the young people on the street who were quickly dissipating almost all wore masks. If this is not the idea that Kevin gave them, then the young man with a smile on his face is really terrible. No matter what happened here, no matter who the witnesses dare to stand up and testify against Du Lin, they all need to face the lawyer's cross-examination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you identify the person’s identity with the hat and mask and only two eyes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando can even imagine that, when necessary, Doolin’s lawyers will also ask for a bunch of young people who will lower their hats and face them with masks. Stand together and let the witnesses tell their identity. As long as the witnesses can't do it, no matter how many people say that the guy they saw is Du Lin, they can't be testimony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially in this society that can spend money to change certain things, there are no witnesses, no testimony, no evidence, and there is money, there is no need for trial. Directly acquitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very smart guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also is also a very dangerous guy, at least from the current situation, Wood should have suffered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Director Prando, is there something big happening, you brought so many police officers...", Du Lin pulled out a cigarette, Delivered to Prando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Prando’s previous character, he would not pick it up. It has nothing to do with the quality of the cigarette itself, but a class gap. Sometimes the gap is too big, even if the fat is sent to the mouth of those who are high, they will be disgusted. It is not that the meat is not good to eat, but the person who is holding the piece of meat is not enough grade! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
