			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, countless reporters rushed to the fifth district, because last night, just as they were filming the charity party’s guests, A targeted mass assassination broke out in the fifth district. According to the results of the investigation by the Fifth Division, people came to the conclusion that this should be an assassination between gangs. What led to this result should be a cleansing by the two gangs for the anesthetic market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing is not a trivial matter, but it is not realistic to say how big a thing is, but it is a vendetta between a group of gangs, even on the news page. Not the first edition. It turns out that some people who have doubts about this will be relieved after seeing the information of the deceased. These deceased are not criminals who have just been released from prison, or gangs with a criminal record. The only Mickey who is relatively clean is also investigated. Involved in too many criminal activities at a young age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some of the anesthetics left over from the scene, the branch has made a reasonable decision for this vendetta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But some people don’t think so, for example, the same night, they were still discussing with the dead the people who asked for the demonstration outside the 350,000 manor on the second day. . They knew that this was not right, but no one dared to say anything, and the shadow of death floated on their heads. They are afraid that they will spread out after telling the truth, and they will become the next group of people who are "cleaned". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they can’t say it, they know a little, that is, Mr. 350,000 is not as harmless as he has shown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the detention center, listening to the people who just came in and said this new thing and guessing who the hand is, the greyhound is stunned. When he got up, he rushed to the policeman who was locking the door. The frightened opponent directly took out the pistol and pointed it at the greyhound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to surrender, I still have to surrender, I have to surrender!", his tears are coming out, not paying attention to those newcomers. The gaze of the guys, I can’t wait outside! Mickey's death is a good testimony to this, and the risk outside is too great. If the other person feels that he knows something, or will reveal something to kill him, he really has no way to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way at this time is not to go out, the detention room can't shut him for too long, but the prison can! He is not sure if he has to hide for a few years to let Mr. 350,000 forget his little character, but he must not go out in the short term. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon the Greyhound was taken away for trial. He surrendered several cases. His behavior and mentality also made the police officers puzzled. These people often bite their teeth and say that they are innocent. How come this guy is not enough to explain this? However, no matter how the case can be solved, it is "performance" for the police officers. Some people send the bonuses and credits to them in vain, and they have not launched them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a very interesting episode. The judge considers the gray dog ​​to surrender and actively confess some of his criminal facts. He is willing to give him a lighter sentence. As a result, the result was not only in the court, but also rushed to the judge to spit, but also took off his underwear and threw the underwear to the judge. The original two-year sentence was directly added to five years. What's more interesting is that this guy got not only no frustration after getting this result, but he laughed like a winning prize... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On such a day, a heavy rain suddenly swept through the entire Irian. When people sheltered from the rain in the bar next to the street, they accidentally discovered that a hearse drove slowly from the Dawn Park along the Dawn Avenue to the beach port. In the rainstorm, behind the hearse, there are more than 20 luxury cars of various colors, and the place where the luxury team passes is silent. Someone recognized the young man in the photo frame on the hearse and couldn't help but take a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many people who know about the events of Little Fules. At the time, although Old Forrest did not deliberately suppress this news, the news is still only among a few people. spread. Until today, the guests in the bar on Dawn Avenue knew that Little Fowlers had not changed their temper, but had passed away. Some people have a faint sorrow on their faces. Although Little Fowlers is a jerk, he has not done much harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even many people like him very much. He is a very optimistic guy. He is an indifferent attitude towards money, which makes him have many good friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solemn and heavy team came slowly to the port during the torrential rain. Little Fowlers once said that if one day he wants to leave the world, please don’t take him. Don't bury him if you burn it. Let him sink into the bottom of the sea with his coffin, where he will fall into eternal sleep. Old Fuller followed his past will, and he would personally send his beloved son to where he wanted to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, the person staying in the hospital ran back to the villa to tell him that when Little Fleurs had died of respiratory failure, his entire world collapsed. Old Fowlers, who has always been good, even fell directly on the ground. He couldn't believe that his son had left himself. He clearly remembered that the doctor had returned from the rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting in the car holding his son's photo frame, Old Forrest did not die like his wife. He twisted his neck stiffly and looked at the butler on the co-pilot. "Is the truck and driver found?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler doesn't know how to answer this The problem, in fact, this time he has launched all the forces that can be used to search the truck across the city, even the sixth and seventh districts have not let go. But so far there is no clue. The truck is like falling from the sky, especially for hitting Little Fowlers. After the collision, it returns to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steward’s silence made Old Fowlers realize that his account has not been done right now. He gnashed his teeth and asked: "Do you think that I have no success? People, so even my words can be perfunctory?", the butler shook his head quickly, so he could not bear it. "Since it is not why there is no news at the moment? Spend money, spend more money, who can provide Any useful information, starting with 500. If anyone can help us find the truck and the driver at the time, I will give him one million!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One million, one astronomical number, even the steward himself has a moment of temptation. No one feels wrong with such a chaotic move. As Old Fowlers said, he has no heirs. He cannot regenerate a son at this age. Even if he has such ambitions, his little brother will not allow him to do so. The money in his hands, the houses, the land will become the ownerless, so he does not care whether the price he opened is too high, he only cares if he can catch the murderer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be what I thought of, and Old Forrests suddenly asked: "I remember that he had hit a girl before he happened, right?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler immediately replied, "Yes, the young master drunk a little while returning from the outside, was stopped by a girl, the girl is dead." His family wanted 5,000 pieces of compensation, but the young master only promised to give them two thousand pieces, and the money is still in the young master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Fule Si was in silence, watching the dock close at hand, he laughed, and the laughter was full of sadness and anger. "Check the couple and check them out. I have to know if they made this. The car accident left my son to leave me. If it is, bring them, if not bring them, they should accompany my son instead of living in this world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
