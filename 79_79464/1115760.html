			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money, how to say it, in any case, anyone can look at the banknotes in their own way, but the money is different. In the hands of the poor, money is the only thing. In the hands of the rich, money is not a thing, even though they are all money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A row of luxury cars slowly passed through the door of the church until the middle of the pure white inlaid with gold rim and broken diamonds, President President Haus stopped at the door. The people in the church were shocked by wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President of the House is a limited edition sedan that House introduced this year. Only nine of the entire empire were built, and three were exported. There are only twelve cars in the world. The luxury of this car is unprecedented. The extra-large interior space is enough to make people feel that this is a car. It is more like an enlarged business car. From the outside, it is a car. Each of the House Presidents sells for 999,999,000 yuan, hand-made, and personalized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car that Du Lin took is the "facade" of the Good Luck Casino. Shareholders have bought this car together, not that they can't afford it alone. The shareholders who originally invested in it are everyone's richest people. In the past three years alone, their wealth has not been raised many times. Buying a million for a car may make some people feel pain, but it is not unacceptable. The reason why everyone is together to buy the car, one is that although they have money, but they are not qualified to order this car, they must be purchased in the name of the good luck casino, and the entire Audis seven casinos only One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this car is parked at the door of the Good Luck Casino for most of the time, mainly for receiving important guests with different status, such as The kings, presidents and even some chiefs of these small countries. The political influence of these people is extraordinary, and each one is a profligate Lord. In order to make them feel the enthusiasm of the city of Otis, there is such a car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When other casinos need it, they can borrow from here. Anyway, the shareholders of the seven major casinos have already fully crossed under the arrangement of Doolin. Shares, you have me, I have you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Du Lin is coming to the wedding, and several shareholders of the Good Luck Casino made a direct decision and set up a team for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If placed before, Doolin will not be so high-profile, he must refuse. If you can't guarantee your own safety, it's too high-profile. It's just that you live too long. The empire itself is a politically advanced country. Money can never be compared to political power here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now it’s different. First, Doolin has a heroic status, no matter how much he spent on this identity, how many people have been asked to preach his deeds. As long as no one stands up to question and denies Doolin's merits from the official level, he is a hero. The hero must have the treatment of a hero, to show his strength, he can now ensure the safety of his personal property, then you should show the guy, you need to start high-profile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A low-key person can never stand in the most dazzling place, because it is only a high-profile person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people say that Magus is a low-key person... It’s just a wrong view. He is really low-key in life, but in the political arena. No one has ever dared to say that Magus is a low-key person. Except that he forced the emperor to give up his power in his early years, now that he has been tough against the forces of force, there is no such thing as a low-key politician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more intelligent people, the more they understand when they can be high-profile and when they should be low-key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, it’s Duling’s high-profile highlights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy bulletproof door was opened by a uniformed driver, and the pure white gloves and the fluorescent ivory white door illuminate each other, giving a strangely high The feeling on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep red soft bag interior reveals the corner of the interior of the car, a pair of shiny shoes stretched out of the car and stepped on the ground. Du Lin wore a white formal dress today, with a hat decorated with red ribbons and a big red handcuffs on his chest. He smiled and looked at everyone. The two sisters of the Hill family looked at him with a serious look, even if it didn't seem to have any problems, it was a process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the glamorous word seems to be unable to describe Dulin, who is as dazzling as the sun. Many people can’t look directly at the light, but they want to To see the bright body, the eyes are stabbed by the dazzling light, leaving tears of poverty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blair also had a moment of disappointment. He sighed. People said that Du Lin was a farmer from the mud dog's legs. He could see his current arrogance. He had more heads than some big family owners, especially Hill. The sisters of the family are like two small followers behind him, but they are the nobles who are just as good. No matter what stupid things they did in the past, they are still nobles and homeowners. The gas field was too strong, and it was strong enough that Brenen felt that there was a whirlwind that was not caused by the rotation of Doolin, tearing away all the arrogance he ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the initiative to take the first two steps, Du Lin looked at him and strode over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not mean to reach out, Blaun can only reach out first, and Du Lin just reached out and shook his hand at this time. "I didn't expect to be here." Can you meet me, you and Merlin know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian went to the head. "Someone told me that he is your brother. But today I am I’m here to be waiting for you, I want to talk to you.” He didn’t say that he was making a trip for the wedding, even if he was looking weak in front of Dooling, he was a nobleman after all, he didn’t need Concerning Merlin’s views on him, as for Du Lin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. "Yes, after the wedding, we sat down and talked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After he finished this sentence, Blaul took the initiative to retreat to one side, Du Lin went to Merlin, stretched out his arms, and the two brothers hugged, and Du Lin jokes like a fist in Merlin's shoulder. Congratulations." Then I looked at Su Rui, who was next to Kinsale, and smiled and nodded. "Fate makes people come together. I hope that you can cherish this experience. In short, congratulations to you." After Su Ruidao, Du Lin looked at Kinsale. "How are you here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kinsale replied with a smile, "Why can't I be here? This is me." Dear brother's wedding, as a sister, I should come to participate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kinsale and Merlin are twins, she always lives as her sister, who comes out first This kind of thing Mr. Kemma said that he is not clear, Mrs. Kesma said that she was asleep at the time, so this became a time Case, Merlin fight a few times was secretly beating Kinsale also to blame, he finally admitted that he is a brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrival of Bren and Doolin made this special wedding not immediately special. Some girls couldn’t help but ran to the church and picked up the phone to share these exciting things with good friends, indirect. Promoted everything that happened here. After eleven o'clock, many very heavyweight guests came to the scene, all of which were well-known local entrepreneurs. They didn't necessarily have the idea of ​​making a relationship with Du Lin, besides trying to get a familiar face in front of Blaine and Dooling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people are now advocating that Doolin is the gimmick of the goddess of fortune. The illegitimate child is not enough to describe the speed of his "expansion". He must be exchanging with the goddess of fortune. Today's results have been achieved after the body fluids. Perhaps the words that flowed out of his mouth contained a terrible opportunity to make a fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a unique wedding, so that Su Rui feels unprecedented satisfaction. Her little sisters can't wait to change her role with her, and the depths of her eyes make her fluttering. People always say that material girls are not good girls. In fact, material girls are not bad at all, and they are easier to satisfy than those who pursue ideals and self-reliance. Of course, first you have to have enough money to make them able to satisfy the material life, then they will become very simple and simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the wedding, there was a cold meal to entertain the guests, and when everyone was a little hungry to start dining, Du Lin took Merlin Going to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave Merlin a cigarette, and the two brothers squeezed their heads together and began to swallow up and smoke. After sucking about three or four, Du Lin asked. Tao, "Is there any intention to do something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin nodded. "How do you say I opened a machinery factory?", he said that he explained "I found that many young people are now running to the city. The countryside has left a large vacant lot but few people have cultivated. The newspaper has been saying that it is necessary to improve the mechanization of farming and liberate the labor force. I think this is an opportunity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin will give Merlin a "living fee" every month, not too much, but definitely not enough, enough for him to maintain a decent life. But Du Lin knows that if he keeps doing this, Merlin will become a bastard in the future. The simplest way to make him mature quickly is to let him have a career of his own, forcing him to grow up quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much is the budget, is there any plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
