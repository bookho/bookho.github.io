			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are talking about something different from what I said before. Have you ever been to the emperor? You know where the Ogingin people live. "During this time, Du Lin did not directly open the topic in the usual way, but instead asked a question that seemed to have nothing to do with the content he wanted to express. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people in the church shook their heads, and after the death of the Guart Empire, they were scattered everywhere, although the imperial government did not publicly express it. These Guarts are not free to leave their place of residence, but some people are paying attention to them at the beginning. When the empire discovered that the Guarts seemed to have obeyed the fate's arrangements for them, they gradually relaxed and even had no monitoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guarts are really too honest compared to the violent provincial sages, and the reluctance to accept them is only part of their character. These people are honest enough to let the empire fall. Heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the relationship network that has been built in one place for a long time, and because poverty cannot withstand the weight of migration, the vast majority of Guarts in the entire empire have not left. The city where you live, even if you want to travel far, will only turn around in the state. So when Du Lin asked this question, the answer to him was very uniform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin began to describe the emperor for these people, describing the life of the country's dominant race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will get up from the soft bed every morning, then clean them with exquisite utensils, put on expensive clothes, and enjoy the exquisite breakfast. Then they will drive their own cars to work. They can get 40 to 60 salary points from the place where they work every month, and at least two months of paid vacation every year. - It means that you don't need to go to work for two months, and you can get a salary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They enjoy rich life and material, women will put a lot of expensive The cosmetics are applied to the face, and the men will take out five or even ten dollars for choosing a tie they like. They don’t need to suffer the labor we think, just sit in a bright and luxurious office and spend some time. Time is all right. Their children will receive a very good education, there will be excellent classmates, build a naive network of relationships one by one, and they may be helpful to their lives after they reach adulthood. Help them succeed . Dominate the country, dominate the fate of other races "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;“Whenever the weekend arrives, they will drive to the family to go to the beautiful places to play. For this reason, they may have to pay a few dollars. They don’t care about the money because they can earn more. Money. They are called successful people, and they are the pillars of this empire, supporting the operation of this empire. People will give them a lot of praise, such as 'hardworking', 'smart', 'lucky' Many positive words, such as 'have persistence', will become the prefix of others when introducing them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Du Lin’s description, living in the Imperial Capital The daily life of the ordinary Ogildin family gradually formed a complete picture in the minds of all the Guart people in the church, rich, happy and happy. Some people have a weird expression on their faces, and more people are stunned. They don't know what kind of meaning Du Lin told them about how good the lives of the Ogildinians are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin said what he had to say, he made a cup of water, and in the process of drinking water, he left enough Time to ferment the ideas of these compatriots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After about two minutes, Du Lin put down the cup and looked at everyone. "Do you live like this? Do you yearn for such a life? Obey your own Sincerely, don't make indifferent resistance, tell me, do you want to have such a life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call out "Yes, sir" from everyone After they began to shout out their desire for this kind of life in dreams, Doolin raised his hand to calm them down, and his expression became more and more serious. "Yes, I know that everyone is envious of this kind of life." We have had it before, but it has been destroyed by some people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the glory of the first king and the gods still shines on us, Ogildin People can only be slaves to us, and the provincial sages are only in the sheepfold and the animals. We are betrayed, causing us to be attacked from within the most critical time of the war, let us stand and change It’s now squatting. But we are not completely Losing all opportunities, even if the first king and the gods have left us, we still have those spirits guarding us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came here, it is impossible to All the best things in the world are brought to you. If I say that, I am a liar. I can only bring you one thing...", he lifted his palm and squeezed it into a fist." Hope!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked out from the podium of the presiding desk, walked in front of everyone, on the steps, and walked back and forth, shouting loudly, "Hope, hope full of sunshine, let you get rid of the hope of life's dilemma, let all Hope that the Guars can stand up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am rich, I can make a sum of money for you to have a happy and happy day, This is easy for me to do. But after the money has been spent, what do you do? Go back to the now miserable days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"So I won't give you any direct help, but I will create hope for you, open up the hammer, axe, sickle, and even the gun of the future!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "We used to be the king of the West. We should not wait for the alms of the Ogildin who used to be our slaves in this dirty corner. We should stand up and walk to those arrogant bands." In front of the prejudiced people, will belong to our things, re Come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't encourage you to do extreme things, it's not my intention, I have to use another method to lead everyone not only Just stand up and climb the towering hills to see the scenery above the clouds!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to arrive earlier this day I hope that all of our Guars can unite. This is also the reason and purpose of my association. We are a family, the first kings do not share the descendants of each other. Our blood vessels are running the same blood and the same roots. We must absolutely trust each other to be able to complete this great cause!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the process there may be bloodshed, there may be sacrifices, but please Believe me, all the bloodshed, sacrifice, all the effort is worth it, it is worthy of your pride, because we will eventually let the whole nation stand up again because of your efforts!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't hide behind people and watch you go Sacrifice, to pay, I will stand up for the first time, standing at the forefront of this wave that will destroy the entire era, to accept the trials and challenges of the times!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Du Lin walked back to the side of the host, picked up the handcuffs on the stage, and stained some of the saliva that had deposited on the corner of his mouth because of the rapid roar. He looked at everyone in the church. These people are very excited, and some are musing. He continues to whisper: "To accomplish this, we need our joint efforts. This is not something that can be done in one day or one year. It takes a long time, maybe It will take decades, but please believe that I will give my life for this and fight for the Guars!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
