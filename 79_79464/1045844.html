			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sandra’s problem is that there is no correct answer, because everyone’s perception of the world, the perception of society, and the recognition of oneself Knowing is different. It's like asking a group of children to grow up and want to do what they want to do. Some children will say that they want to be police officers, some children will say that they want to be scientists, some children will say they want to be thieves, and of course Some will say to be a person who is useful to society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be dozens to hundreds or more of the answers for a thousand children, but these answers will become because the title itself does not have value. Does it make sense? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, in fact, these answers are very meaningful, because children are at a very special stage, their curiosity and cognition of the outside world will slowly build for them. A complete personality. The influence and inspiration they receive at this stage will be more intuitive. If this content is not unexpected, it may become the main direction of their personality construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that seemingly simple question and answer, some children hold a position that conforms to the social morality and ethics, telling their grandfather that the money should be given to the parents. , or other family members, or handed over to the owner. These children occupy a considerable part, but these children eventually become ordinary people, deprived of the family's surname power, because they do not have the family needs, their talents and family direction is slightly biased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a big family like Di Plessy, the talents needed are not complicated, and there are several people after the conclusion. For example, managers who are responsible for managing family businesses and industries, and ensuring that they will not lose these things, such as being responsible for opening up new markets, will be able to detect this industry before an industry has just begun or even started. The forerunner of the fire. Or is it loyal to the family, even if it is the executor of the law for the order of the family... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra didn’t tell Du Lin how she answered it. In fact, on that day, she wrote her answer on paper and gave it to her grandfather. The "answer" was put aside alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would you do if you saw ten dollars on the ground? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra answered this way - lend ten dollars to Uncle xx and let him promise me more money next year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the elder members of the family she said was very talented and hard working. At the time, she managed three companies. But this person likes to gamble. No matter which way he can give him the thrill of heartbeat, he will try, even if he doesn't understand the rules. But this person has an advantage. He never moves something that belongs to him. Whether it is money or something, plus work ability, the family does not deprive him of his duties and powers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half of his family dividends and industrial dividends are put into the pockets of others through the gambling table, which makes him often laugh and say that he is a poor Ghost, but as a family member of the Diplecius family who is eligible to return to the estate for the New Year, how many are poor ghosts? It’s just that a big dividend every year is enough for them to spend their days, let alone the family elites who manage the three companies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer is very interesting, which also makes Sandra's qualification to eat the dinner that is actually not pleasant. She didn't know why the gods gave the answer, maybe this is a natural talent... right? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was looking forward to watching Du Lin at this time, Du Lin thought carefully and then answered the same answer, "I won't tell you!" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, many of the topics that seem to have no content can be sold out of the character that some people have been deeply hiding. The simpler the topic, the more content that needs to be considered. The less, the same plus one equals two, when people see this topic, even if they don't need to think, they will have the answer of "two" in their hearts, and then answer it. The same is true for the problem of how to do money on the road. Many people may blurt out, "I will definitely pick it up." If there is a stranger present after the answer, or if you want to show it, after a short time, you will catch up." Look at the explanation of whether there is a loss of the owner and the public values. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what answer Du Lin thought of, he wouldn’t say it, he wouldn’t expose his character, and making up a lie to perfuse one is insignificant. The question is too naive, so his answer is the same as Sandra's previous answer. I won't tell you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what did Du Lin think? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s actually very simple. He wants to find the owner of ten dollars. As for how to do it after finding it, that is another thing. In Du Lin's view, the person who was qualified to lose ten dollars a decade ago is absolutely amazing in his wealth. Of course, there is another problem that extends here. Since ten dollars were counted as huge at the time, why didn’t anyone come to jealousy, or was this money deliberately placed on the ground? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why some questions ask children more effectively than asking adults. Children will not consider their own interference with society, nor will they consider the interference of society. They will only rely on their own heart to answer their truest truths. s answer. Adults are different. They will consider whether there are things they have not seen in this question. If I answer this question, will people who like the questions like or dislike, and how to answer them will be more in line with their own people. Set the settings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of adults is very complicated, really not a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, okay, I don't ask..." Sandra looked a little bit drinking, this time Du Lin noticed that there was already less in the bottle. Half, this is a 750 ml bottle. "What are you going to do next? If the two bastards take the initiative to be a platform for the door, the situation may have been determined, and some changes will occur."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time when the doormen were restricted to freedom, these big capitalists did not happen, and their silent attitude was already propagating their position to everyone. The smaller capitalists who are attached to these people have also turned into neutral camps. But with the changes in the attitude of these two people, these small business hawkers will re-enter the camp of the farmers without shame. In fact, we cannot say that these people have no position. After all, life is not easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duralin can still answer this question for Sandra, and the answer is very simple. He leaned on the sofa and ordered a cigarette, and Sandra had one. "The choices of Carlos and Clilan will not make any changes to my decision. They are either absent, done or not. Doing certain things will not cause any problems for our original plan. Of course, they may regret it, but that is not our problem, is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "People must pay for the behavior they do, no one is no exception!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra’s eyes lit up, she immediately realized Du What does Lin mean? The original plan, the doorman is alive! At the same time, she felt a little nervous for Du Lin's resoluteness. After the defect of the Mennon had been eliminated by him, he would kill him. Will there be an accident? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman is not an ordinary person, he is not only the mayor of the city of Villier, but also the leader of the largest party in the west, in case of the door The death of the peasants angered these party members of the Kadima Party. Is it possible that a political event with great influence will erupt in the western region, and will also give them serious obstacles to the strategic plan to control the western region through various means? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
