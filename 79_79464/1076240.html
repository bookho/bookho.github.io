			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Dulin knew why Kevin laughed so much... Ripple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister Hill is very famous in the diplomatic circle of the Imperial Capital, belonging to the top level, and the most important place is also attributed to the identity of their twins. . They were born in the Hill family. In the past, this was also a noble family. However, it was a pity that the family was separated from the title, and then stood in the old party's ranks less firmly in the new and old alternate periods. When Mr. Matt, the grandfather of Hill’s sister, saw that he could not stop the new party from taking office, he immediately jumped out of the old party’s camp and joined the new party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of judgments on political mistakes completely ruined the political future of the Hill family, and their achievements in business did not improve. There were always some northern chaebols. Staring at the Hill family's industry, as long as they develop to a certain scale, they will suppress them from all sides as a punishment for their position. All the nobles know very well that death is not terrible. The terrible thing is that there is a noble blood flowing in the body, but it can only live in a world without hope like a civilian. That is the greatest punishment for the nobility! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Mr. Matt is very decisive in a heart attack, greets God’s arms to him, returns to the embrace of God, and messes up Left to his son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Matt’s son is not a good talent, which is not common. It is difficult to have mediocrity among the nobility. The elite education they have been exposed to since childhood and the mistakes in the social stage can make more mistakes than ordinary people, so that they have the capital to accumulate more lessons than ordinary people. After a certain social status, there is often a model of success. But this successor is an exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also accepted a very great elite education, but then Mr. Matt’s wrong judgment made him lose his aristocratic and civilian class and exercised. The biggest difference is that it can withstand more failures, so he can only become a mediocrity in the end, relatively speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why there are always so many successful people in the nobility, and most of the children out of every aristocratic family have become the elite of today’s society, why the nobility Is the yield rate much higher than that of the civilian class? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because they can make more mistakes but not bear the unbearable consequences. For the civilian class, a wrong judgment may ruin them for ten years and twenty years, and even for a lifetime of hard work. If they fall, they will never climb again. It is. But the nobility is different, their deep heritage and richness, including the power in their hands, enough to make them fall up after being lifted, and kicking behind the butt to make him run faster, or fall again, until They don't wrestle until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many mistakes, they gradually understand how to make the most correct judgment when facing one thing, then they must be successful. It will inevitably become the mainstream of this society, which is the biggest difference between the nobility and the civilians in terms of family inheritance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lessons of the civilian class usually need to be summed up by the failure of several generations, if their experience is not outdated, and there is an outstanding In the offspring, this ordinary family has the qualification to take off, but it is only qualified, and it may continue to fail. For example, the experience of previous generations has fallen. If you succeed, you will naturally get rid of the civilian class as the middle class of society, become a partner of a large enterprise, or open a small company by yourself, and then their children will have the opportunity to make two more mistakes, gradually The family has become stronger and stronger, or started again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility is quite simple. The elite education they received as a child instilled lessons and accumulations that were equivalent to hundreds of generations of civilians, and then they directly combined Part of the precious wealth to continue to fall and climb up, and then cast their own glory. Each generation is a heritage, even multiple inheritance, which is why civilians can never catch up with the nobility, even if some people seem to have become very, very remarkable people, and never as good as nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Bowworth, he can never compare with Magus, forever! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline of the Hill family has made this family a very difficult choice. They must find a breakthrough in the blockade of the old party aristocracy, and secondly they need to be able to appear in the family. He assumes the role of all responsibility. This person is Hers Hill. He is the nephew of the current Hill family. He is temporarily drafted as the next successor. At the same time, they have also drawn up another plan to find a solution. By any means, get the shares of the imperial central bank to save the increasingly weak family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very good plan and idea. Once they hold a certain amount of shares in the imperial central bank, their industry can take the initiative to accept the central bank from the Empire. Internal policy capital injections. At that time, the northern aristocrats raised by the group of bitch girls wanted to continue to suppress them from the commercial side. They must take into account the attitude of the imperial central bank. They must know that it is the largest economy of the empire, and they rarely Will compromise to the outside, and has not dealt with the northern nobility, the Hill family will be saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, it is obviously cost-effective to sacrifice the personal interests of some people. Everyone thinks this, which also creates the super-social flower of the sisters of the famous social circle of the emperor, which is definitely an extraordinary enjoyment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know..." Du Lin shrugged his shoulders. "You are very tempting to say that you are also being publicized, but I believe ......", he looked up and down Kevin. "You don't deserve them to do this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin is not angry at all, but smiles, "damn it. I thought you would invite me, we are good friends, I remember you often say this!", Du Lin saw his swallowing movement, he hesitated, then shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe you will be very disappointed, I am not going to give them the results they want, this thing should not let two women come to talk to me, I need to see the people at the director level, no matter who they are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words made Kevin a little discouraged, he complained a few words, "Do you know? That is the sister of Hill. Many people think that if they can be happy with them, even if they are immediately poisoned by the princess's poisonous melon, it is worthwhile." This poisoned melon is from a widely spread legendary novel, but in content. Insinuated the scandal of the royal family. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the royal family felt that many princes had a great threat to the imperial power and the royal family, the royal family decided to proceed with the removal of all the princes and a large number of dukes to stabilize their regime. Not shaken. At that time, the strongest prince had already had the idea of ​​wanting independence, so the royal family arranged a very shameful trap. The prince used to be the emperor’s rival. They were all queens’ pursuers, but the emperor’s lord took the course to win. It is. His Majesty the Emperor asked the Queen to write a letter to the prince saying that he was dissatisfied with his life and hoped to talk with him privately, so he went to the Queen's invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in that special period, even if the old lover who never forgets invites himself, the prince is also prepared. They met in a manor outside the imperial capital, when only the queen went to the appointment, and she was also searched for. Then the two of them talked to each other because they were physically weak. The Queen said that she was very annoyed and had some chest tightness. The Prince helped her to undo some extra ornaments and a few ropes to let her catch her breath, and then she couldn’t help eating. A queen who carried the melon for more than 30 years, the poisonous scorpion died... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
