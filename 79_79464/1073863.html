			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Mr. Kaile, the riots on the scene are not a problem. The problem is that his special status within the federation cannot be shaken. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years ago he came to the empire with the mortal determination to open the first federal hotel in the Empire, and achieved unprecedented success. At that time, his family, his friends and even his dog did not agree to him to come to the empire, but he still came, is it love? Is it responsibility? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it’s for speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A war of aggression made the federal people aware of the emptiness of the empire, and also allowed the federal merchants to see a lot of business opportunities in the empire, more business opportunities than the federal. At that time, the empire was in political reform, and a large number of social resources released from the hands of the nobility were piled up in the corner of no one's interest, and these things were inexhaustible profits once they were operated. The federal business is much more developed than the empire, and there are more ways to make money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Mr. Kaile was only an ordinary businessman in the Federation, and he was more than enough. If he did not find a way to break through his own path, he would have been in his life. It was a small businessman, and he found this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t think about how this would change the international situation, even he thought that the Empire and the Federation might last for many years after the war. The cold war state, but his appearance, has become an important node that he could not think of. He changed the Cold War, which might have lasted for more than a decade to a few decades, because the role of a small person and the relationship between two war-fighting countries have inexplicably broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, it was said that Mr. Kaile was the revelation of God to people, and this statement is still very popular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Mr. Keller made a fortune. The reason why he made a fortune was not that he operated Kailemen and some other businesses that made him make a lot of money. The special status gained gives him the power to make a fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Keller is happy, he not only has money, but also a respected businessman, and is an international affairs adviser to the Empire and the Commonwealth. In the buildings where the Empire and the Federation represent state power, everything he does comes from his status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, some people are trying to destroy his position. This makes him feel angry and has a heart that he can't say. He looks at Du Lin's young looks and asks himself, is this an isolated incident? Or is it an unknown plan trap? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not think that Mr. Kaile would come so quickly, he still had some accidents, and then he smiled and nodded. "Mr. Kaile, hello, I am very interested to sit down and talk with you, but...", he raised his arm to reveal the watch on his wrist. "I have two very important meetings to attend. I can only say sorry for your invitation, but I believe we will have a chance to have a good chat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goodbye!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin slammed the window, and as soon as he stepped on the power pedal, the car slowly left the parking line and disappeared into the traffic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Keller’s expression became dignified. He watched the intensive car flow for a while and turned back to the hotel. The police are maintaining order. They have caught some young people. These young people are squatting against the wall. Everyone is caught by their hands. The face is frustrated after being arrested by the police, but there is no smile. Calm and surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Mr. Keller’s assistant director took the initiative and went to say hello, “Mr. Keller...”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Keller also saw the assistant deputy director, his face suddenly filled with a smile, and took the initiative to reach out, "Ke is long, I did not expect to alarm you, I don't know what to say." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enthusiasm for Mr. Kaile and the good assistant who called Ke Ge did not show much joy. Everyone in the emperor knows Kaile Mr. is a good gentleman. He is polite to everyone. It is like this person will never be angry. Everyone has a good impression of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two stood in the door after shaking hands, and Mr. Kaile took out a cigarette and gave it to Ke Ge. He glanced at the wall and squatted behind him. A row of young people asked, "How would you dispose of them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keuge Assistant Director took the cigarettes and looked at the group of young people. People, "Do you say them?", Mr. Kaile nodded. He continued, "We will take them back with the crime of disturbing law and order and intentional injury. After calculating the losses and expenses incurred by you, Let them compensate. Of course, if you want to sue them, it is ok. Several of them have involved heavy injuries and they have reached the standard for further study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, minor injuries are mainly based on mediation. If the injured party has to sued the party who applied the injury, it is not impossible, but even if it is brought to court, it may not be cheap. Compared with the tens of dollars or one or two hundred dollars that may be compensated, the lawyer's fee is not cheap. Maybe the compensation obtained through the lawsuit is not enough for the lawyer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the heavy injury is different. Heavy injury has already endangered personal safety. If the victim sue, at least the party who applied the injury can be sent to prison. When starting in the year, if you have more, you can see how the lawyers of both sides defended. For these young people, Assistant Secretary Ke Ge knows who is standing behind them, and everyone knows who the person is, but if these young people don’t confess, there is no way for anyone to take that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For them, going to jail is equivalent to going to further education. Once they are in prison and coming out of jail, their status and status will be significantly improved. Jailbreak is not an unbearable fact for these young people, but rather what they expect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant director of Ke Ge felt that Mr. Kaile’s temper is good, and he will have some thoughts, but what he never thought about is that Mr. Kaile actually Do not pursue any responsibility of them, any! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put them, I am willing to forgive them. It is the privilege of young people to make mistakes. We cannot give them any chance because they have made mistakes. An old man, I have a special tolerance for young people." His kindness is like being really as he said, "Would it make you embarrassed?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistant Ke Ge stunned. "Of course not, this is your power, sir. If you are willing to understand that they are their honor, I have no power to stop you from doing this." He asked a police officer to come over and then looked at Mr. Kaile. "Are you sure, sir. I know that if I give this order, I will not have the right to arrest them even if you change your mind immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, just do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in the incredible gaze of the hotel staff, those Young people who beat them and destroyed many hotel facilities are so light and easy He was released. They looked at Mr. Kaile, not sure what happened, and they felt that it might have something to do with Mr. Kaile’s decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Kay’s willingness to resolve the current troubles is actually the best result for the Assistant Director of the Ke Ge and the Bureau of Investigation, so that they do not need to consider measures to detain these young people, and this will not have to do with Du Lin. Too much to talk about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending away the police and investigation bureau, Mr. Keller sat in his luxurious office, letting the lobby manager who just wrapped his head look for Come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is quite unlucky, his nose bones are cut off by the flying head, and there are two mouths on his head. Fortunately No need for needles, just a simple treatment. At this time, he stood in the study room of Mr. Kaile, and he did not dare to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kaile’s face is no longer the smile of the spring breeze when he is outside, and the temperament of the whole person has become somewhat horrible. He looked at the lobby manager with a blank expression and smiled softly. Although it is a laugh, it can not give people a feeling, but it is not a kind of irony. It is a kind of irony that treats the ants. "Who asked you to stop Du Lin from coming in?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the general manager!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let him come to see me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Not more than a while, another man in a white dress first walked into Mr. Kaile’s office. His face was full of anger. When he saw Mr. Kaile, he complained, “Father, this thing. Can't just forget it, we need to retaliate back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man is the eldest son of Mr. Kay, he has a daughter and stays in the federation . From the very beginning, Mr. Keller knew that everything he got today did not come from his ability to do business, nor did he have any slight relationship with business. If his child simply inherits his wealth, up to two generations or It is three generations, and his efforts in the latter half of life will become a bubble. He took his son to the side and gave him a general manager position, hoping that he would know how to run the industry while he was still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the identity of the general manager of Kailemen also allowed him to reach a large part of the empire's high-level, to expand his network, and smoothly from Mr. Kaile's hand Inheriting the industry has a very important role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one wants their own descendants to be poorly managed because of their poor business. If you can, every pioneer who created the myth of commercial wealth wants his family business. And the family can inherit many generations, but now it seems that his son has not figured out his situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
