			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, as far as I know, had considered the policy of implementing free education for all the people before the federal financial tsunami, but later because of education funds The expenditure exceeded the space reserved for financial purposes, and finally regretted the choice of delay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We all know that the federal economy at the time could not support free Education policy, then how do you ensure that free education is sure to continue in Abiloo? What is your ambition?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being for Doolin The reporter who was interviewed was Du Lin’s old friend, an international distinguished journalist who emigrated from the federal government to the empire on the grounds of political asylum, Mr. Ma Jili. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last release of the "truth", Majeri came to the empire and settled down. In view of his courage to report the "truth" in the federal period, and the style of not afraid of power, "Imperial Daily" directly hired this outstanding journalist, became a column writer, and as a frontline reporter, continue to play his light and heat. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Du Lin put an unprecedented bomb and shocked the whole society. Free education has always been a kind of pursuit of ideal life in the past. The slogan and expectations, the vast majority of people are eager, but they are very sensible to understand, this is impossible to come true. In such a big environment, Du Lin first proposed the implementation of free education, which made many enthusiastic people urgently want to know more content. . Education, medical care, law and order, and employment have always been the most concerned topics. The attention of the society has once again focused on Du Lin, the "star politician." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like a light source in the dark, always attracting the attention of the society, "Imperial Daily" sent out and Du Lin has a good Privately married Ma Jieli came to interview him and talked about the issue of education. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin tilted his legs and his hands pressed naturally on his thighs. He replied with a smile and smiled calmly, "I have not been to school...", He said that he couldn't help but smile, and the room suddenly lit up. The reporter who was in charge of photography was very keenly grasping the moment he smiled, vivid and natural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the beginning of my sensibility, to the time I left my birthplace, I have not received any education during these 16 years, I will not study, but also I can't write, those things are very strange to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went to the city of Tener alone, I thought about earning my first bucket of gold by washing the cars for the rich, but..." He shook his head, his face was remembered, and there was an aftertaste. Later, I went to the station to work hard. Whenever I fell asleep and fell asleep, I would think that this would not be the life I want, and I would not like to live in such an ordinary life. I and Like all young people, from the illusion of the future, the desire for quality life, I know that I need to work hard, I need to struggle, I need to use my own hands for myself to be able to fight for a bright future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the meantime, I also tried to change some jobs, but all failed. These failures gave me enough lessons. In the process of summing up these failures, I found a problem, that is, the better the job, the higher the requirement for education!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When a tramp does not need you What will it be, but if you want to be a meeting Then you need a professional qualification. Lawyers, doctors, managers, and more high-income occupations have strict access standards, all of which are related to education and knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I realized that I need to change!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need to know how to read correctly, and write. I I used my money to report a short-term cultural class, where I began to master the skills of reading and writing. I strictly demanded myself to squeeze all my potential in my spare time. At the end of the cultural class, I probably I got the education level of the fourth grade of elementary school."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This also made my fate change a little, and I also deeply realized that knowledge Things, and destiny are firmly linked!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been learning since then, I have to mention one to my entire life here. Very important friend, Mr. Kevin, he gave me the biggest Reed and help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Kevin told me that you must read more, no matter what it is, you must read more, since it can be printed Books, then there must be hidden knowledge and wisdom accepted by the society. I respect the literate people, Mr. Kevin is a cultural person, so I listened to his advice to me, I began to read more More books."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whenever I find something that I don't understand or don't know, I will look up the dictionary, then copy them down and keep them in my heart. I will try to understand the literal meaning of every sentence in the book. And the deeper meaning it wants to express, I will study it, then tell me myself, I got another harvest, grow up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In countless times of growth and harvest, my destiny has changed step by step, just like what you see now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sitting here, Accept your interview."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People tend to say that Mr. Doolin has a lot of wealth, they are saying money...", Du Lin is slightly proud I laughed a few times. "But in my opinion, my greatest wealth is my knowledge and my desire for more knowledge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majie I made the most affectionate sigh at the most appropriate time. "Too inspirational, Mr. Doolin, I have never understood it in a deeper level. I didn't expect you to have such a past. I remember that you said a word, 'Knowledge changes fate,' is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin points Nodded, Majri asked again, "So, do you still think so now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I always think so, this is the right thing!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So is this why you want to promote free education?", Majeri wrote something in his notebook, looked up and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded again and said, "I, as the most significant beneficiary of the knowledge-changing destiny, I should make more needs." There is such an opportunity for people who change their destiny. I don't want many of them to be the same as when I was young, because poverty can't afford tuition and give up the education of children. In the long life of the future, because of the current miss, they missed the life that might change. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a socially responsible new party member, an empire entrepreneur, I am willing to take up my responsibilities and give back to this society. You just asked one The question, how does free education continue in the state of Abiloo, my answer is simple, that is, responsibility, obligation and rights!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that as long as I can implement free education during my term of office, so that children can enjoy free educational resources, after the end of my term, they will go to the society and rely on free education to help them. Change the trajectory of my life, then they will also experience the true feelings and thoughts of my heart at this moment. I believe that more successful people with more successful careers will stand up and stand with me for free education. Add new motivation!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And, as long as I can afford it, I will continue to take it!”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very touching sense of social responsibility!", Majeri praised Du Lin's dedication to society, and then talked about another question, "but some people think that the slogan of your free education is only In order for voters to vote for you, you may not be fully implemented. It is possible to conduct pilot-free free trials in only a few schools. How do you rate this?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Silence for a moment, "narrow, ugly, stupid. These are not enough to describe the humble psychological dynamics of these people. They don't understand me and express their opinions on my behavior. This is obviously very stupid."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If they really want to see me ugly, the best way is to let me succeed in defeating others, then take me to the sky, then watch me can't do it, see It’s the most appropriate choice for me to be ugly, not to use a mouth like a woman to measure the world!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour of interviews from the horse Jerry got enough material to write a serial topic. At the end of the interview, he asked Du Lin. "This is the last question. If you want to describe yourself in one sentence, how do you feel the most? Appropriate?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not think, blurted out, “Young is the power to change the times!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the evening, Majeri wrote a press release and sent it by telegram. "Empire Daily" newspaper, published in the newspaper the next day of the second edition. Once the report was released, it immediately gained great social repercussions. This evaluation was almost one-sided. Both of them thought that Du Lin had done a good thing. This is what the empire should do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improving the education level of the whole people is definitely not a bad thing for the entire empire, and the degree of education has increased, so the emergence of talents has increased. More talents will emerge, and a large number of fresh blood will appear in every field. These people will promote the rapid development and renewal of all aspects of the empire and embark on the path of the world's great powers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
