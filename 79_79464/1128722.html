			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young boy is called West Warika, from a very small Principality of the Eastern Continent, with a population of less than half a million. Because of the small population, it was not a problem in the education of all other countries, but after going to high school, West Warika entered the society and struggled until he heard that the empire began to open its immigration policy. Only came to the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the year he came here, he saw the "emperor covered with gold on the ground" that people said in his mouth. Of course, it is impossible to really shop on the ground. It was full of gold, but even if it was just an ordinary job income, it was the salary of his parents for three months. The bustling empire has destroyed their understanding of the world for those from relatively backward small countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a high school degree and a two-year experience in society, West Warika has become a well-known figure among young immigrants. There is a stick of sixty-seven years old and even twenty-year-old boys who regard him as the leader, follow his arrangement, and have certain connections and prestige among the immigrant groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was educated, had experience in society, and was more aware of the decisive power of money in this empire that looked at money, so he was very clear Du Lin’s return means that this should stop here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But teachers, and other participants, overestimate their role in immigrant groups, and underestimate the style and courage of these imperial people to do things, this is fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has learned about Du Lin, because Du Lin is very young and young enough to make many nobles feel terrible. He has nothing to make people feel shocked. A person walks from the countryside to the city with bare hands and then gets out of hand. How can such a person treat him with the minds of ordinary people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the investigation bureau arrested some immigrants who participated in the conflict but finally forced the people to release the momentum due to the demonstrations. Once and twice, it is impossible to continue to use it. In the end, it is only possible to lift a rock and lick its own feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are too stupid, too eager to be a beneficiary, want to be a middle-class figure in society, ignoring that they are not worth the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to go out to avoid the limelight, and the West can't wait for a while." The boy said that he stood up. He glanced at the stunned sigh of relief and sighed. "You are so stupid, don't want to die." Also leave as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as the only person in West Warika who feels pretty good among them, not how successful he is. Just because he is "stupid." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very enthusiastic person who has no brains. Siwarika feels that someone must not take more risks and then take advantage of it. The simplicity of pushing him to the table, he secretly observed behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Luo Hu can succeed, that person will pick out the place to replace the 腮胡, if you can’t succeed and accept the lesson of failure, that person will always The silence will not be out again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is innocent, at least West Warika feels so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a grasp of the fluffy beard, he was not sure what Sivalika said, but he realized that he might be in danger. After careful nodding, I was just about to say something, and there were several people outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't go anywhere!", Savy stepped into the room from the darkness, and he glanced at the boy and then looked at the hustle and bustle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Du Lin got the list, he figured out the character of these people. He needed two people to be role models. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stupid, stupid and honest, such a person will make more people feel that "he is not even as good as me, now it is so mixed, then As long as I work hard, I will be able to mix better than him." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a good person who is not a good person, treacherous, and the existence of such a person is a reminder to another person of character On the hard road of the superstructure, there is a way, as long as you can find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the original plan, the teacher and the teacher were very much in line with Doolin’s request, and the teacher had already handed it over to Ellis, the kid. Roots, as long as you don't need to move your mind, you can give it to him. Here, Savi is responsible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he didn’t think that the left wait couldn’t wait for him to come out. There was another person here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to the tension, fear, uneasiness, and ignorance of the hustle and bustle, West Warika is very calm, if his legs are not shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at least in his expression, he didn’t change so much. He looked at Savy calmly and realized that this must be Dulin’s person, Zhang. When I opened my mouth and said something, I almost couldn’t say it because of the nervousness. After coughing twice, he said something that made Savi a little unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to see Mr. Doolin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About more than two hours later, Savi With two people arriving at Doolin's estate, Du Lin was chatting with the teacher. The teacher who has always been ignorant or even contemptuous of Du Lin’s performance is sitting on the ground like a pug. The laughing facial features are crowded together, and the eyes are mixed with the mixed eyes of surprise and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no other person at this time or he knows to join in, he may kiss Doolin's shoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at it and asked curiously, "Why are two people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Savi has not spoken yet, West Warika has taken a step forward and bowed his head and expressed his attitude. "I asked to come to see you, Mr. Doolin."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer made Du Lin slightly surprised. He looked up and down Siwarika. The teenager gradually overlapped with the descriptions on the list. He smiled and shouted the boy. The name, West Warika. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s me, sir.", West Warika took a deep breath and drummed his chest, which made him feel in his body. Filled with faint courage, he looked at Doolin. "I want to live, sir, no matter what you need me to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin finished listening Then, after laughing, he waved his hand. "How can I do so cruel to you? You think too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; West Warika did not take this sentence seriously. "We have done some wrong things and damaged your interests in the West. For this reason, I am willing to do my best to help you settle the current chaos. For this I can Do anything for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
