			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next evening, the slave miners who worked all day long carried the baskets and pushed the mine cars out of the deep mines. At the high point of the mine guards, there were long guns in their hands, staring at the slave, and being extra careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dark cross next to several must-have routes in the camp. The wood grain of these crosses is hidden in dark red. The cold wind blew, and the rigid body that hangs on the cross will sway back and forth with the wind, and occasionally collide with the cross, giving the sound of pengpeng not like the human body hitting the wood. In an environment of minus fifteen degrees, a few hours can make people start to stiffen, and in ten hours it will become a huge popsicle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some popsicles that retain a little natural skin color, which was hanged last night. They are all new slaves, just in Andorra yesterday. When they received "Alice's, they took six long shots and killed thirty-one guards and almost ran out!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alices They came to a dozen people. In order to prevent any accidents, a group of mine guards were selected in the mine to concentrate on Andorra’s own residence. Outside the villa, in the event of an accident, they were able to rush into the villa in the shortest possible time and in the shortest time, killing all of Ellis. This caused a short period of vacuum for the guards on the mine. Some firepower points that should have been guarded by two people and three people left only one person to guard, so that the group of slaves found the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, in the face of Andorra’s malicious Ellis and others did not resist, let the mine protection team return to the camp area in time, and defeated these preparations Wrap the slaves that more people flee together, and hang them on these crosses, and always warn those slaves who may not be put into action because of hesitation, and it takes a heavy price to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bodies will be left in the spring, and once the temperature rises, they will be thrown into the wild in order to avoid the immune disease. Those Gobi wolves can always find these around the mines. Good things, not only do not need to hunt, but also fill the stomach. It is said that some biologists believe that the Gobi wolf's body shape has obviously degraded. If it continues to develop like this, it will take only one or two hundred years for the Gobi wolf to degenerate into another animal. The biologist also called on Westerners not to arbitrarily feed and protect the Gobi Wolf's hunting instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this is a joke, the scholars sitting in the armed terrain car never understand, even if those Gobi wolves have degenerated, they are not unarmed. Humans can deal with it, it only makes them grow fatter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the employee's residential area on the other side of the camp, Ellis ate the grilled lamb chops in a warm room and watched the latest tape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andorra did not deal with these prisoners, not only gave them enough for fun, but also hired several skilled women from outside to look after them. they. When he does this, he naturally has his own purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Du Lin came, it was certain to be able to win Du Lin, but he wanted to transfer those golden little cutes from his pocket to his own It takes a lot of effort in the pocket. Andorra learned about Du Lin and knew that Du Lin had other family members. Once Doolin firmly refused to cooperate, the money would become the property of his family. So Andorra must create the illusion that he just wants to make some money to make up for the investment and will not hurt Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step in providing a favorable environment for those of Ellis. After Du Lin also lived in, what he saw, heard, and enjoyed would let him put down his own war, and finally transferred a large part of his property to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andorra never had the ability to take all of Dulin’s property in his hands, thinking that he was also a rich man, he knew very well the rich. The idea - people who have no value will naturally lose the value of survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only if Du Lin has money in his hands, he will think that he still has value and will not face death soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Dulin’s “famous name”, Andorra does not care at all, here is the west! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alice brothers, don't you worry?", compared to Ellis's gorging food, other local guerts I am worried, I can't eat a meal. They don't know what kind of ending they will face, and how can they have an appetite to eat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aellis put down the lamb chops in his hand, he picked up the napkin and wiped the oily mouth, "Worry?", the word from his mouth When I came out, I was a little vague. He shook his head and said, "I don't worry at all. Your understanding of the boss is limited to the most basic level. I want you to rest assured that you can eat and drink. Boss will take us. Go out and let Andorra get the punishment he deserves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? Why do you believe Mr. Doolin so much?" The question was raised by a 25-year-old young man who heard from other people about Doolin’s speech in the church, and his parents’ persuasion. Also joined the fellowship. It’s just that he doesn’t quite understand that this is a monopoly smaller than himself. Why is it worthy of others to trust him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guates in the west are not the same as the guates in other places, especially the two generations of the new born, they live in a news that is relatively occluded At the same time, the place where the folk customs are simple, if not self-protected, may have become a proof of the presence of vultures or Gobi wolf activities somewhere in the Gobi. The Guars here are more self-reliant than the Guars in other places, and they have more self-reliance. They are not always in a numb life, they also need to face provocation and some fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply straightforwardly, the Guars here are a bit more wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aellis shrugged his shoulders, and he leaned back against the back of the chair. The red and blue plaid makes him look like a "Successful person", he laughed and said: "Because the boss itself represents the possibility, he is the Messiah given to us by the first king and the gods, I have no reason not to trust him!", before waiting for others to say, he is a kind A very strong tone continued: "I know what you are worried about, you are afraid of death, but I am afraid, but I can overcome it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are reasons Two, first, after I die, I will reject the call of the first king and the gods. I will stay here and become a spirit, guarding around the boss and the church. My name will also be engraved in all the churches. The other way is always immortal, and this is what I am pursuing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second point, if I am dead, the boss will kill all and Andorra has a direct relationship with people to bury me, I use my own life, I can replace dozens of To more of the life of the Ogingin, I earned it. Even if I am dead, my mother can proudly tell everyone that her son is a hero and has been immortal in a heroic way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, sometimes I really hope to be able to fight for the boss, this will be my eternal glory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Simple and simple words make other people in the room start to move. They can't imagine what kind of personality charm Du Lin has. It is actually a person who has his own independent personality and thoughts. He is willing to take the initiative to approach him for fear of death. death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He... can you really do it?" The man hesitated. His reason told him that this man named Ellis was crazy, but his instincts told him that this is the truth! The inner shackles quickly formed a wave of invincible, and at the same time, there was a thrill of excitement! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People, always eager to change anything, whether it is themselves or the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, within three days, the boss will appear in front of us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Ellis was arrogant, and the unquestionable voice made these people inexplicably yearning. They began to ask about Doolin's past, which is what Ellis is very happy to talk about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first king has his own twelve heroes, so Du Lin will have such a role, perhaps himself is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Du Lin’s past has been retelled by Ellis, and the people around him listened attentively, exclaiming from time to time, or I silently waved my fist and devoted myself to the birth of the Messiah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky outside the house quickly turns black, and that is the case in winter. It’s black after 5:00, and it’s no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are huge light bulbs in the camp to illuminate the locked barracks, in the whistle tower on the surrounding high wall, one by one guards Constantly scanning the barracks, according to the rules of the camp, anyone who left the barracks after closing the door will be killed immediately! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The riots that occurred yesterday made their faces very ugly, and it was hard to calmly accept the death of more than 30 colleagues. Although the line they do is not taking away the lives of others, or being killed by others, there will always be some extra feelings when they get along for a long time. So they all made a fuss, and as long as someone dared to come out, they would never let those damn slaves. At the same time, under the cover of the night, five trucks were parked five hundred meters away from the Andorra mining gate. A group of strong young men dressed in grey clothes, with gray hoods, jumped from the truck with a gray rifle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them is special because he doesn’t have any disguise, and the whole person is taller than others. As he licked his nostrils, he licked the box on his back and looked at the high point around him that could only see some outlines of the terrain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
