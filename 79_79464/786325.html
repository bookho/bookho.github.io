			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Doolin", Du Lin took the phone and put it in her ear and put it on her shoulder. He turned over and looked at the clock on the bedside table. Six o'clock in the morning. He usually gets up at this time, and this is the first time he has been called up by the phone during this time. He blinked and took the phone to the desk next to the window, and the voice was answered in the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice has not been heard by Du Lin, because it is a stranger, did you make a mistake in the early morning? However, the next sentence from the microphone told Du Lin that the other party did not make a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello Mr. Doolin, very pretentious to disturb your rest at such time, because things are more sudden, so I think I should notify you in the first time. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I almost forgot to introduce myself, I am Mr. Luke’s legal counsel, and I am now officially informing you, because Mr. Luke personally I decided to give up the business of 'Southern Film Company' and go back to the west, so he could not continue to perform his duties according to the agreement signed by the two parties the day before yesterday, and expressed his apologies and regrets to you. According to the supplementary terms in the agreement. Regarding the requirements of the default part, Mr. Luke decided to pay you the default according to the actual market value of the 'Southern Cinema' company."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you have any comments You can communicate directly with me or make a final decision by the court through judicial procedures. If you have no other opinions, I hope that you can provide all the accounts and related facilities of the original 'Oriental Star Entertainment Company'. The list makes it easy for us to make a new assessment of the actual market value of 'Southern Film Company'. After the evaluation is completed, we will pay you according to the actual market value of the company and buy back 50% of the shares in your hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you heard clearly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat in the chair for a while, only to lick The face sighed: "I understand, I will contact Mr. Luke first, this is really a bad news!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, bother you!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hanging up the phone, Doolin pulled all the curtains away, and the sun in the summer time had already jumped out of the sea level, sprinkling the golden light on the earth. He was bathed in the sun, watching the golden sun and the golden sea, as if the heart was as comfortable as a baptism. He held up a lazy waist and never made him feel comfortable like today. It is absolutely very unexpected to hear such a good news early in the morning. There was a smile on his face, and it may not be long before his plan can be implemented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply groomed, changed a suit, and pushed the door open toward Dawn Avenue. This is something he has to do every morning. It is said that regular life can help a person to establish a good personality and lifestyle. It seems that every successful person has a good working time and a regular life, which may be one of the necessary factors for successful people. He remembers that there is such a big sorrow in the dream, he will get up at four o'clock every morning, then after an hour of exercise, he will wash and have breakfast, then let the driver drive to follow himself, and he walks away from the company. Get on the train one kilometer away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So am I a successful person now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may not be long before it is! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that today’s morning is not the same as the previous morning, and there are already two people on the table that belongs to him. It stands to reason that Du Lin should be angry. Isn't that buddy not knowing that he has to sit in that chair every day for a wonderful morning? Perhaps it was because Luke’s lawyer called him to be very happy this morning, so he was not angry, but chose an adjacent location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect it to be the same as the rumor. The first sun shines on the face of the statue in the park from the rising sea level. It’s amazing!”, the young guy sitting on Doolin’s desk couldn’t help but praise, the sunrise on Dawn Avenue is indeed a very special view of Irian. At the moment when the dawn tears the night, the sun can be seen to spread along the head of the statue at a speed that is visible to the naked eye, until the entire statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But looking at the sea from the position of the statue, it is not necessarily a glance at the sun, because the street is somewhat curved. And it is too long! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl sitting next to the boy seems to have no interest, there is nothing to say, it has always been the young man who said that this time to see the feelings and feelings of Irian. This kind of tourists is actually very much. If you don’t go out and look around, you will never find the greatness and magic of this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter brought Dulin’s breakfast every day, and apologized to Du Lin for apologizing. He just closed his eyes for a few minutes, that’s right. The young "couple" is already sitting in the position of Doolin. He couldn't get rid of the guests, and it was difficult for the guests to change positions, so he had to apologize to Du Lin for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, it's just a small thing!" Du Lin smiled and the waiter breathed a sigh of relief. He was really scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he didn’t know Du Lin’s identity, he didn’t think Dulin had anything special, but since he knew that Du Lin was Mr. When there were countless assets, he had a fear of Doolin. As an unprofessional migrant worker, he knows too much about how terrible the rich can do. If Du Lin is not happy, just saying a trivial sentence is enough to make him unemployed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three apologies, the waiter left, and then the newsboy jumped to Du Lin. He looked at the other adjacent table with a strange look and did not express his doubts. He took off the cap and then tore a newspaper from the backpack and opened it on Doolin's desk. Du Lin took a piece of paper money as many times as before, and stuffed it into the hat of the newsboy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't have anything else that I need to do, I will go to work!", the newsboy buckled the cap back and straightened his position. Slightly owed a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head with a smile, and the newsboy also showed a white tooth with a mouth and a smile that was as bright as the sun. "So goodbye, Mr. Doolin! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind Doolin, the woman who was sitting against his back shook his body, and the young man immediately asked about it. "What happened to you?" Is there any place uncomfortable?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is like not seeing or hearing the companion’s inquiry, she slowly turns her side and looks back Behind him, the politely cocked legs, browsing the newspaper... bastard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word bastard she blurted out, gnashing her teeth and tightening her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man is somewhat inexplicable, "Who is a bastard? Am I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du browsing the newspaper Lin slowly put the newspaper back on the table, and then slowly sideways, looking at the girl sitting behind him against the light. He just stunned, then smiled and pinched the edge of the hat with his fingers and said with a smile: "Good morning, Alisa!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa felt that she was going crazy. She hadn't forgotten Du Lin for a long time, because the rising belly kept reminding her that a bastard had planted a small life in her stomach. She knew that Doolin was the "golden robber" who robbed the bank. She thought that Du Lin would not be seen again in this life, but what she didn't think was that when her life was moving toward the normal track, the bastard appeared. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard!", the two syllables of a word are almost squeezed out of the gap in Alisa's teeth, she can't wait on Du Lin Bite a piece of meat. That day, I had somehow explained my first time. I also magically let this guy hit the bullseye and let her suffer from rumors for a long time. Now this guy actually said a good morning in the sunshine. Doesn't he know how to spell this word? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa directly stood up and sat down on the chair opposite Du Lin, staring at him "evilly". Du Lin also looked at Alisa with a funny smile. He never worried that Alisa would sell herself, because if she reported herself, Alisa would also be arrested for conspiracy. She had revealed a lot of news between the clouds that night, and the news helped Du Lin solve a lot of troubles. It is necessary to know the imperialist central bank that has never been reasonable, but they do not care whether you are passive or active. In short, the people involved in the case must be unlucky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Amp interrogated Alisa, she said nothing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other for a while, Alisa asked. "You have nothing to say to me?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s gaze shifted from her eyes to her belly, and the chin was still the smile, “Congratulations!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows how crazy Alisa is at this moment. She feels like a cat and wants to grind her paws somewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Dave also sat down. He looked at Du Lin with some incomprehensible circumstances and looked at Alisa again. One sentence, "Is this your friend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is not my friend, he is just a bastard!", Alisa snorted, Put two arms on the table and clench your fists. "How can I meet you at this place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
