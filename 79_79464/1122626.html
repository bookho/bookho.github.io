			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When are you going to get married?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sit down after Magus In a word, Dolin did not respond, is it so urgent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at Magus in a puzzled way, his legs twitched twice, and there was no change in his face, not surprised, not surprising, look Going up like thinking for a while, said, "I don't want to miss the election in half a year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus nodded, this is Dulin's clever place. He did not avoid this problem, but also recognized the benefits of marriage for his participation in the election. Now that he and his niece have not known each other for a long time, the hasty marriage will make the wedding look like a kind of interest, then his marriage will become less valuable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marriage is sacred, there is no doubt about this, even if the empire is somewhat advanced in many respects, with a different aesthetic, but on the issue of family , from the top down, holding the status of recognition. A perfect family can add a lot of points to a public figure under a spotlight, including politicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family is a manifestation of social responsibility. There is no such thing as self-cultivation in this world, but everyone knows the essence of truth. If a politician does not even manage a family, how can he manage countless families in the whole society? At the beginning, Mrs. Peter and Vivienne had already made a stranger and still maintained a marriage, just to ensure that Peter would not be deducted too much in the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a year, Du Lin got married and had a family, which indicates that he will take on more personal responsibilities and social responsibilities. This is a mature performance and can please a lot. A rational voter and middle class, so he is really serious about considering this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also where Du Lin is most satisfied with Magus. He looks like he is still young, but in fact he thinks about the problem and Magus. The way of thinking of the elderly who have experienced many things has something in common. They can ensure that they have a sharp side and can make themselves very mature. Such a person with contradictory characteristics will have only one Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will have an engagement ceremony next weekend, you know, some things always take the first step.", Maggs did not say Throughout, Du Lin understood it. This is a statement, followed by Magus. "Since you have chosen this path, you should understand that many times personal interests will never have collective interests." Important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have always heard that the fellowship is a very exclusive civil society organization. This is very bad. You know that the country's current policy has been working hard to promote national integration, Ogildin, Guar, provincial or other people. In the strict sense, they are all imperial citizens, all of them are imperial people!" Magus also had a little prejudice against the fellowship. Before, he and Du Lin’s "relationship" did not reach this level, so he would not say something. Now, Du Lin is going to be his niece, and he hopes to reverse Du Lin’s values ​​and make him the most worthy person in the empire. He will naturally say more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusion of the township association is not just an isolated incident. Du Lin’s management of the fellowship is so good that the provincial sages also spontaneously made some comparisons. Closed-out small groups, if you can't solve this problem from the root cause, the consciousness gap and the ethnic barrier will only become more and more serious in the future, and may have some bad effects in the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin immediately nodded and said, "I am already modifying the charter, and I don't know if you noticed it. Recently, my team has added more There are no faces that have appeared. Of course, in the past I was somewhat narrow in some respects, and you will soon see something different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggs I don't know how many times I am satisfied with Doolin's behavior. He also noticed that Du Lin's team has three more eye-catching characters. One is a Nadia woman, who is a former senior partner of Nanshang. People, Ogildin, now mainly responsible for Du Lin’s financial. It is well known that finance is always the most important and most private issue for individuals or companies. It is the real core. It is not the kind of people who absolutely trust that they will not touch these things. The addition of Natiya has changed many people to Doolin. The view, or prejudice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two are sisters of the Hill who are known as the shame of the nobility, although their reputation in the nobility circle is not very good, but it is undeniable. It was Du Lin who took a good step in the game. He asked some nobles to start looking at him. This is very important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this marriage, he is more integrated into the aristocratic circle than he and Magus himself imagines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin continued after a pause, "I have a part of the business I am going to give up. As a public figure, I have been mentally prepared, such as private wine." I will end all aspects of the business..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus looked at Doolin a bit strangely, and he was very aware of Doolin’s current private wine in the empire. How terrible the business is, some data show that Du Lin's private wine market share has gradually declined, but profits are rising. For Irian's winery, Du Lin is currently able to provide more than three million profits per year, and private wine is not just about profits, but also the market, and the right to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those things can no longer be measured by money, and power is always above the money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus sighed silently, this is the terrible place of Doolin, he can give up anything that needs to be abandoned in order to achieve his goal, no Hesitate, no love, and cut down. Even if the sale gave some of the great aristocrats in the empire, they would not give up so easily, and there are too many interests in it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complex light of his eyes flashed away. He didn’t know if he was right or wrong to train Du Lin. This young man is terrible, his The decision, the unswerving pursuit of the goal, and his enthusiasm are all destined not to make him an ordinary person, hoping that the choices he makes will not make him regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Magus has become more uplifting, precisely because Du Lin is so good, if he can stand in the right position and agree for the Empire, Then the empire will not need to consider big troubles in at least one hundred years in the future. If such a person is put in the past, it must be a person who will remember history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very pleased that you can do this. You are the best young person I have ever seen, and I hope that you can go further!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two then talked about some other things, including some of the interests of the city of Otis, based on the most important resources of Doolin, Ma Gus hopes that Du Lin will be able to transfer the property rights of a part of the land to the City Hall of Otis, so that the City Hall holds a certain level of land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Otis can now be said to be Doolin’s back garden. This is definitely not a joke. After the city area of ​​Otis has expanded, there is still a percentage. The sixty-fourth land is privately owned by Doolin, which has touched the nerves of some people. No one has raised this matter in the past for two reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, these plots were taken privately by Dooling through the City Hall auction before the city of Otis became the SAR, and all his actions were The legal personnel of the Ministry of Justice track the fairness throughout the process, and there is no violation of the rules. He even invited a large number of well-known wealthy and entrepreneurs in the society by letter before the start of the auction, including a considerable number of nobles. But everyone knows that the city of Otis at that time was a wasteland, and the tax amount for the whole city was sometimes less than ten dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, a city, tax less than ten dollars, and this is the site of the new party, which is enough to show that this place and the garbage heap does not have any difference, spending money in the city of Otis, in addition to the brain has problems, no longer There are other possibilities. His formalities are all legal, so these property rights should belong to Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason is that the privileged class is also a face. It is not impossible to do this. The key is to be beautiful. If Du Lin is a stupid egg, they have already done it. Dulin's treacherousness is not like a young man, and the thoughts of these people are cut off. Moreover, Du Lin will use public opinion and always shape himself into an oppressed minority empire dream achiever. The plundering of him may lead to a series of serious social phenomena, once the capitalism is rapidly expanding, once Uncontrollable adverse effects have the potential to shake the country’s roots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will watch the wealth that they struggled to be plundered by others in various names but indifferent. Today’s silence means that tomorrow’s disaster will come upon others. Silence, those capitalists will fight hard to make things big, and this will not pay off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that Du Lin is going to participate in the game according to the rules of the game, then some things become simpler, do not need any intrigue, let him let it out. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no opinion on this Du Lin, he will retain no more than 30% of the property rights, free of charge to give out 34% of the city Property rights to the City Hall. He did this and made Magus feel that he was a jerk. Even if Du Lin called out a very high price, Maggs would accept it. Anyway, they had just plundered the federal bank of the Federation and never felt that they were so rich. Looking at money now is like reading paper. Duulin does not mention the money, but to donate to the city of Otis, but it is not easy to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus glanced at Du Lin and slammed a jerk, and Du Lin smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can’t help you to deal with it, is it right? I will fight back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, these things will eventually be lost, so that these things will maximize their own interests in the process of losing, not only to the city hall, but also Encourage media public opinion, create a hot topic, let the whole world know that it has donated hundreds of millions of wealth to the city hall of Otis City and donated it to the imperial government! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
