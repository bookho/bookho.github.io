He had thought about suing Graf and Dooling. Since they are not willing to continue, they can leave them for fifty dollars. But soon he dismissed the idea. The two guys looked at the poor who had no money. If they couldn’t get a fifty-dollar penalty, they would be sent to the cell for at least three months. rice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Krien is a businessman, a capitalist, who invested in the railway of the city of Tener, a member of the Yaoxing Imperial Railway Union. It is also a shareholder of this paragraph. His purpose is to make money, not to be angry with people. Du Linuan is also closed, and if Graf hates it, it must be provoked. So he decided to talk to the two well, but he couldn't wait for the left, and he couldn't wait for the right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even held his nose and went to the work house, and the two guys didn’t even come back at night! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that really makes him unable to continue to endure is the sloppy style of their absenteeism, knowing that the workers are oppressed and exploited by the capitalists, whether at the factory or at the station. Basically there is no freedom. To be more profound, the servility of the workers was motivated, and they have lost their desire to resist under the constraints of their rules and institutions for a long time. To put it mildly, long-lived money, for the meager salary, they have to bow their heads and obey the oppression and exploitation of the capitalists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few people would like to change something and do it in person, but Doolin and Graf did it, not only did it, but also made it so blatant. They took this free-spirited thing from the outside to the station. Six or seven workers have been absent without notifying Mr. Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Klein believes that if this matter is not properly resolved, then this wave of free and sloppy will appear, and may even be at some point The workers are infected. At that time, his station was basically finished, so the most important problem now is not enough people, but to solve these two people to other workers, let them understand that if they do not work according to the rules and regulations, the only end is Rolling the roll and getting out of the way, you have to pay a sum of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After buying the farm, Doolin was not in a hurry. He had arranged for the Buddha to find some members to build a house for him. The house doesn't need to be beautiful, as long as it can shelter from the wind and have a wide enough door. What he meant was to dismantle several sheds on the farm that were about to fall apart, and to rebuild them according to the previous structure, and then ask the two carpenters to guide them in the ranch. It is absolutely possible to build the warehouse before the arrival of those wines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arranging the work of these people, Du Lin and Graf returned to the station. This time they did not come to work, but planned to execute the contract with respect to the breach of contract. Part of the provisions. To put it simply, they are coming to send money and then leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that Du Lin is afraid of Mr. Klein, so he must send money, but the business he is doing now is not a legitimate business. He must also face the large and small suppliers in the entire city of Tener. Before you fight the enemy, you must first check that your armor weapons and shields are in good condition. The battle in the mall also has the same process. If his opponent suddenly took him and did not fulfill the contract, he violated the contract and asked Mr. Klein to sue him. In addition to being fined, there may be jail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he has to fill in all the big and small holes in his body, not giving any chance to future opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Klien retracted his head after standing on the second floor and yelling, facing in all directions or looking at jokes, or worried eyes Du Lin’s heart is not a little bit bleak. Outside is a complex big society, in this station, there is also a small society of the same complexity. Some people don't like Du Lin. This is normal. Just like someone doesn't like Graf, there is nothing surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more closed the environment, the stronger the desire for people to climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Graf went up the second floor and walked into Mr. Klein’s office, Mr. Klein sat behind the desk with his fists on the table on. His face looked angry, his face was thick and his face was thick. He suppressed the anger that wanted to violently, and whispered, "What do you want to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halfway through, his brain froze. He only saw Du Lin walk straight to his desk, then took a roll of colorful paper money from his pocket, ordered 15 sheets on the table, and then Push it to him. The scent of ink emanating from the cute little pieces of paper made him think that these should be real money, because he was too familiar with the taste and had to touch every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the roll of money that Du Lin had retracted into his pocket. There should be more than two hundred, three hundred less. He picked up the sheets on the table and took them up. Every piece is carefully watched, yes, it’s real money, the empire’s ten-dollar bill. The emblem of the front imperial royal family, the opposite is the AT-11 sweeper war machine. His fingertips crossed from the printed part, fully feeling the special feel brought by the companion carving. It is real, yes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took some money and looked up at Doolin. Du Lin took a chair and sat down. "Mr. Klein, I Thank you very much for giving me a place to rest and eat when I have nowhere to go. This has changed my life for me. One hundred stars is my breach of money with Graf, that is to say from now on. At the beginning, we lifted the labor contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The extra fifty yuan is my personal thank you for helping me when I need help most. This is my sincere gratitude, so I hope that you can accept it. In addition, I hope that you can write a receipt and invalidate the contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Mr. Klein came back to God. He looked at Du Lin with a complex look. He didn't know where the lucky boy found a way. It is not difficult to see from the lavishness of his shot that fifty yuan may not be a big number in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a capitalist, Mr. Klien has a devout devotion to capitalism. If Doolin is a poor boy, he will reveal his own die and lean forward. The body sprayed his saliva on Doolin's face. But Du Lin is now a rich man, he must make a move that is in line with his own identity and in line with the status of the other party. It must be elegant, noble, and not vulgar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment, nodded and took out a white stationery, and wrote a hundred-dollar receipt on paper with a pen full of ink. And wrote the date, signed the word, and stamped the chapter. Later, he turned and took out the contract between Doolin and Graf from the personnel file cabinet behind him, and covered it on each page many times with a scrap chapter that was rarely used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this moment, Doolin and Graf have no connection with the station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin very much appreciates Mr. Klein’s, he reached out and shook hands with Mr. Klein. “We’ll talk about it, about six. After the day, there will be 2,500 boxes of low-alcoholic wine coming from other places. I hope to spend two more days in the warehouse of the station because I need to contact the vehicle."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
