When he was, he licked his head and pointed to another conference room for the meeting and said, "Come up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin puts down the work at hand After looking at Graf, Graf patted his shoulder just after the goods. "No need to be nervous. If there is no accident, it should be a trade union person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Although in Graff's view, the people who deal with the union are just a trivial little thing, but for the first time, Du Lin, who needs to face such a large organization as the trade union, has a smile on his face that has become stiff due to tension. some. He patted his cheeks and took a few deep breaths. "Don't worry, I won't be nervous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf shrugged his shoulders, this kind of thing He can only help himself. He can't help Du Lin ease his inexplicable tension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the union is still an important aid group for the workers. Most of the time, the workers do not use the union, but once the union is needed, , can play a very crucial role. For example, dealing with capitalists, if there is no union help workers are likely to suffer, especially in terms of salary. The hateful capitalists always hope to save more money through exploitation, but it is precisely because of the union and the union's "Minimum Salary Protection Act" that capitalists can't be too devastated by workers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the rights of workers are infringed by the capitalists, the unions will stand up and support the workers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A famous sociologist in the Yaoxing Empire, and also a big capitalist once said in the newspaper: If a worker is a rabbit, then a group of workers is A bad dog. We can shave the rabbits in exchange for money, but we must also avoid the dogs to protect ourselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement immediately caused a huge sensation in society, and a huge parade broke out against the sociologist’s inappropriate remarks. . Under all pressures, the sociologist had to publish his own apology in the newspaper. The original thing should be over, but it’s okay to die. This guy then made a new comment. There are only a few words in the comments - I lost to the bad dog! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angry workers became violent this time. They violently slammed the sociologist and smashed his clothes and slammed him on the railing outside the platform on the third floor of the Empire State Building, causing a sensation throughout the country... .... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sorted out his dress and knocked on the meeting room. After hearing the "coming in", he pushed the door in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three people sitting on the side of the conference table, two men and one woman. The woman looks like she is in her thirties, wearing a very elegant suit, but the lines on her face are a bit stiff and lack the gentleness of some women. The other two men were also wearing a smart suit, and the flies on their hair could not stand. Du Lin's smile, he looked out the door, he did not seem to enter the wrong room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the three of them are in front of you... If they are representatives of workers, Du Lin is the first to disbelieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If workers have such dresses, how rich the working class should be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older man smiled and nodded to Doolin, then looked at the information on the table in front of him and asked, "You are Dollin?", he said with a glimpse of his eyes, and quickly introduced himself. "Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Frank. I am a representative of the workers' union. The gentleman next to me is Apduy, and me. The identity is the same. As for the lady..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he looked at the woman, the woman nodded to Du Lin with a blank expression, "I Called Serena, the legal counsel of the Workers’ Union.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank took over this time and continued: “We are here today to invite you to join on behalf of the Workers’ Union. Workers' union is a big family belonging to the working class. In the face of the cruel exploitation of capitalists, we can only fight for and protect our rights and interests. From the establishment of the workers' union to today, we have 22 years. History, in the past 22 years, I A total of more than 17,000 disputes were resolved for the workers’ brothers, protecting the rights of the workers’ brothers.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Serena suddenly interrupted and asked "Turn off." She pointed her finger at Doolin's right hand. "I noticed that there is a bandage on your right hand and some blood on the bandage. Is this the injury you suffered while working here?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin hadn't reacted yet. He stunned. "Ah? Ah! Yes, it was the injury that occurred during this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serina nodded. I don't know what she meant by nodding her face. "After your injury, the station manager Mr. Klien will take you to bandage the treatment, and pay the medical expenses, and give you some compensation for work-related injuries?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin scratched his head. "This is something I accidentally made, and has nothing to do with Mr. Klein."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Serena stood up and slammed the pen on the table, more serious. "No, boy, you made a mistake. Whether it is hurt yourself, as long as you work." This is a work-related injury. For this reason, Mr. Krien should be responsible for this!" She looked at Apduid, "Go to Mr. Krien!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Frank looked at the nervous Duling, stood up and walked over, and asked him to sit next to Doolin’s shoulder. “It’s okay, we should Let you understand that everything we do is not for the private benefit of someone, and this does not justify that the workers’ union can protect our rights?” He patted Du Lin’s shoulder again. “You are sitting. Just look at it, don't talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for Apduy to walk into the conference room with Mr. Krien, facing Selena. When the famous female lawyers in the trade unions, Mr. Kliin also took the lead in nodding, "Hello, Ms. Serena."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceilin Na still squinted, without the slightest movement. When Klein came to sit down, Serena said: "Mr. Klein, do you know what happened to Doolin during his work?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kryen stunned, he really didn't know, as the stationmaster of the station, the manager of the station, he has a lot of things to deal with every day, who has I am in a mood to understand the life of the workers? Dooling did not say that he certainly did not know, and it was because he did not know, so at this moment, he fell into the passive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dignified expression looked awkward, and looked at the bandages on Du Lin and Du Lin’s hands, and suddenly felt the roots sour. As a manager and exploiter, what he hates most is dealing with people in the trade unions, because you don’t know the reason why these disgusting guys will say funny and absurd in the next second, so that his capitalists are very uncomfortable. It’s a blessing of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Klein shook his head and said, "I don't know, Du Lin didn't tell me, I don't know anything about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then you know what kind of consequences should you bear when the worker is injured as an employer during work?", Serena opened the book, wrote something with a pen, and looked up at Klien. "For example, a work injury. Medical expenses, nutrition and paid vacations?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klien is silent, he not only knows, but also very clearly. In the station, the porter's injury is actually a very common thing. Some workers obviously have no strength, but they are reluctant to make a commission. They will always force their tired body. The result is often unable to bear heavy loads and hurt themselves. At this time, he needs to come out and take money to eliminate the disaster. In fact, it is not a big money. For example, Du Lin is injured in the palm of his hand for up to three dollars in medical expenses, and then the nutritional expenses add up to no more than six dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the problem is that the six dollars are also money. It’s really not the time for these trade unions to come. If you come back in a few days, isn’t there so much? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina’s tone suddenly rose up, “What? Mr. Klien, are you unwilling to pay this fee? If so, we May be sued in the court of Tener."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klien immediately raised his hand, "Don't, don't, I give, six dollars, right? I will tomorrow. Just give him a holiday!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He directly confessed that it is really not worthwhile to fight for six dollars. Just ask a lawyer for more than ten pieces. If you have money, it is better to save a little for six dollars. He immediately expressed his willingness to pay these fees and gave Du Lin a three-day holiday, which immediately made Serena quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apuduy asked Mr. Klein to leave, Frank said with a smile: "Oh, this is the power of the union! Today we are here for the main purpose One is that you want to be able to join the workers' union. Once you become a member of the workers' union, you can enjoy a lot of benefits and treatment. Things like today are just trivial things, and the power we have is not What you can imagine, the most important thing is that no matter what happens, the cost of fair treatment for us will be paid out by the union. You don't have to pay even a penny."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, to enjoy such benefits and benefits, you also need to behave and pay. For example, fifty years of membership fees, if necessary, participate in the union's unified activities, and some have Regarding work arrangements and guidance. If you can accept these three requirements, then I will represent the workers' union and welcome you to join."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
