			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is he?", the mayor of the city raised his sleeves, without the grace of the upper class elite, he walked back and forth, looking from time to time Mrs. Vivian, who was silent on the bed. If it wasn’t for the servant who told him today that the physiology belt had not been used up, he simply did not know this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physiological belt is a long strip of cotton texture filled with some substances that are easy to absorb water. It is a small thing for women to use during the physiological period. . The poor people use it more simply, it is just a cloth strip. After use, wash it and wash it in the sun, collect it and wait for it to continue. But for a family like the mayor, this kind of thing is a consumable item, and the maid will send the new physiological belt every month according to the time of the reservation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, the maid found that the physiological belt of last month was not in the drawer. She knew that Mrs. Vivienne might be pregnant, so she excitedly told the butler about the news. The servants in the family are actually a little worried. It is a terrible thing for the servants in the family to go to the mayor and Mrs. Vivian. It means that one of them can't complete the sequel. Great cause, the harm to the family is devastating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the owner is older and unable to give birth to future generations, these servants will start thinking about finding another way out. Instead of hanging on a tree, waiting for the old master to die after the old master died, they were expelled by the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the hostess’s pregnancy is definitely something to be happy for all the people in the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the question is... the kind of wife in Mrs. Vivienne’s belly is not the mayor’s adult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the butler told Peter and congratulated this delightful news, there was the above scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter’s cold eyes were filled with raging anger. He knew that Mrs. Vivian had found some little men outside to have fun, but he was not very care. As early as he met Mrs. Vivian, his ultimate goal was not love, but interest. He can allow Mrs. Vivian's romanticism, and can also allow her to fool around, all this is the result he deceived Mrs. Vivian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like himself, there are several mistresses outside, and even he has speculated on himself. The one who can't give birth to future generations is him. So this further aggravated his indulgence of Mrs. Vivian, but there is one, Mrs. Vivian should not have feelings with anyone, and should not be pregnant. This is something he cannot tolerate and is impossible to forgive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed the button on the pure gold buckle, unbuttoned the button, slowly pulled the belt down from the waist, rolled his arm, revealing A section of the tip. Even if he is going crazy, he still retains the most basic reason. He knows that Mrs. Vivian is not hurt too much, let alone killing her alive. No matter what the old thing lying on the bed can live for a few years, but at least when he is alive, the mayor must bow to the authority in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his arm hard, and the leather belt was drawn in the air with a wind and a whistling sound on Mrs. Vivian’s arm, exposed A blood mark appeared on the skin in the air, and it quickly became red and swollen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sell the goods, tell me who is doing it! Otherwise I will never let you be better today!", Peter shivered when he spoke, but he was very good The control of his own violent emotions, not yelling, but a low bite of teeth biting the word. He slammed the belt again and slammed it on Mrs. Vivian's body. With a bang, the belt bent over when she touched Mrs. Vivian's shoulder and took her back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter’s impetuous rushed to tear off Mrs. Vivian’s clothes, clenching her teeth, her eyes flashing with fierce ecstasy, waving again and again The belt in the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long the past, Mrs. Vivienne’s body is bloody, lying on the ground and gasping, Peter’s angry mood has converged a lot. He smashed the belt that had been deformed, put down the sleeves, picked up his shirt, and glanced at Mrs. Vivian, who was on the floor, and pushed the door away. When the door was about to close, the voice of the mayor was heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will find that guy, even if you don't say a word!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The temper of anger and destruction, the mayor felt much better, he went to the restaurant to sit down, let the butler give him a glass of high-quality wine, and put three ice cubes. He hooked his fingers and the butler bent down and listened to his instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How many people know about the lady’s pregnancy?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indifferent tone and the ruthless look of the mayor’s ruthlessness made the housekeeper’s heart whisper, he whispered: Three maids and one servant knew the news. I told them not to circulate them for a while, and it was not too late to discuss them after the news was confirmed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Good!", the mayor pointed out that the butler, from the fruit bowl on the coffee table, took a red fruit into the import, and forced a bite. The cold juice and the sweet and sour taste stimulated his taste buds. Some red blood-like juice splashed out of his mouth and landed on the transparent coffee table. "Handle these people away, pay attention to silence, I don't want to I heard anyone talking about it, did you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steward’s heart jumped, although it was not clear why there was such an order, but as a housekeeper He decided to loyally perform the task of the owner's account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call the lady's driver, I have something to ask him." The mayor waved his hand, the housekeeper left and left, and there was some pity in his eyes. But soon it was replaced by perseverance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short time, Mrs. Vivian’s full-time driver was a little nervous and stood in front of the mayor’s adult, although he was a full-time driver of Mrs. Vivian However, he rarely has the chance to see the mayor, the big man, even if the two are husband and wife, there is very little concerted action. He bowed his head in uneasiness and called the "mayor of the mayor." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter lifted his leg, and the "activities" just made him feel a sense of comfort that he had never seen before. At this time, his face had a smile on his face." Where did Mrs. Vivienne go most recently?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver didn’t dare to lie, he stood here and felt that he was going to breathe, how? Dare to lie? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. I often go to the Delil Art Museum recently. She often buys some paintings or works of art."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delier, the mayor of this person still knows that he will know this person from the first day he came to the city of Tener. He had friends in the capital, and Delil had some problems with private morals. He was kicked out, and he had to end up in a small city like Turner to sell some so-called "artworks". Mrs. Vivienne took back a lot of things from him. Some of the mayors also invited people to read them, and finally got a comment that “it’s worthless”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
