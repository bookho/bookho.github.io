			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, I tasted the dishes made by Mr. Juan’s wife, and Du Lin was full of praise. It’s not really delicious, but it’s really worthy of his praise. As a rich man, there will always be one or two professional cooks in the family to cook. If it is not particularly important, the owner will not cook in person. Juan really thinks that Du Lin and he are very close, especially when the two of them are in the process of chatting and chatting, and time will pass without knowing it. This gives him a feeling of seeing each other and feeling after dinner. Not willing to let Du Lin leave, and talked for more than half an hour before the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning home, Du Lin looked at Freina accidentally and sat on the sofa in the hall. He left the key on the door and specialized. In the craft pot that puts the key, take off the hat and hand it to Dove. Go straight to the sofa and sit down. "Don't you go to the crew to report it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lena gave a strong smile. Of course, she went to the crew to report. Not only did she report that she had a conflict with Corinna’s female watch, but more trouble was that she followed the director’s opinion and wanted to ease the relationship between them. Let the film finish well, and know that it has become more and more feeling that Corinna has brought her threatening Corinna directly to "find the parents." She called the rich man behind her and said it clearly, either she went or Freena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of Freina itself is the human character, the rich man who wants to hold the red Freina and the rich man behind Corinna is a good friend, maybe I want to hold on to the purpose of borrowing, to raise my fame by holding a female star in such a relatively cheap way, so I have the extra supporting actress of Freina. Now that the heroine is not doing it, then this human character will naturally be canceled. These rich people will not destroy the feelings of each other for a woman who is destined to be someone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Corinna had a big hate and found Freena and told her that she was out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing this news, Freina was stupid, but she did not continue to entangle, but smiled and said goodbye to the members of the crew, then turned away. . She was a little overwhelmed and didn't know what to do next. She had to return to Du Lin's manor for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When any woman is always weak, the stronger the performance, the more the actual injury is. On the contrary, those ordinary girls may burst into tears if they suffer such a blow, but they will be better after crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freena’s tears in her eyes told Du Lin that nothing happened during this time. She felt that she had not done anything wrong. Corina kept on her actions and she could not do anything. If she accepts it silently, then her play is very likely to be cut off. Only by standing up and protecting herself can we be respected and recognized by others, but not including the enemy. She didn't think that Corinna would be such a person, but it was a few verbal confrontations that would make her shout out "I have no me" so close to rogue words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, she smiled with tears, raised her wrists and extended her fingers, gently leading away the tears in her eyes. "In fact, there is no big deal." It’s just starting again, and I don’t seem to have started. I have nothing at all, and I can’t change me if I lose it again.” She took a deep breath and solemnly succumbed. “I’m going to go back tomorrow. If I can, can I stay here for another night tonight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin has no reaction during the whole process, which makes Freina true. The dead heart, just as she had given up and was ready to go back, Du Lin said a word, let her have a feeling of sunlight piercing the heavy clouds on her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you going? Here is Irian, not a small, remote place. Their money may be good in those places, but in Irian, They can't say anything!", he hooked his fingers, and Dove walked to his side a few steps. He looked back and looked at Dove and said: "Give Scott a call and let him come, I need Talk to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the words, Du Lin looked at Freena and patted her shoulder. "Go makeup, in Erie. Ann, no one can surpass my will on my site!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott came very quickly, he was busy suffocating these two days. At this time, it is a lazy one to come to Du Lin, and take a break for a while. He took off his coat and sat on the sofa. The sea breeze blew through the empty space between the columns, and let him close his eyes with satisfaction. "Du Lin, do you say that you rich people will enjoy it?" Or is it only you who is the most enjoyable person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a meaningless chat, so long after the villa was built. No one is willing to buy it, there must be a reason. Those big rich people are moving millions of tens of millions of property, and there is not much liquidity other than real estate. But they can afford the house, but no one can start, so Scott has such a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought for a moment and replied: "It may be that it belongs to me, so they let me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha...you are really saying this. Interesting, do you believe in fate?" Scott did not think that Du Lin was very arrogant. He is also a young man. Most of the managers in this city are young people. It is not a shame that young people should have the publicity of young people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders and took a snake fruit from the plate and threw it to Scott. "I’m here to find you. I ask you, if I want to make a colorful movie, are these devices ready now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott bites a big bite on the snake fruit The sweet juice burst in his mouth. He said with some reluctance: "The equipment? That is not very good, but it is not difficult to spend some money if you really want it." Equipment manufacturers can produce, these capitalists have spent a lot of money to develop the production method of this equipment, the purpose is to make money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people know that this kind of thing is not more complicated to produce than black-and-white camera equipment, how can it be sold? Therefore, only one set is produced per week, and a set price is 129000 pieces and 999 pieces. Such a high price has not only failed to fall under the premise of only four sets of production in a month, but also continues to rise. It is said that the price of each of the top ten orders has been fired more than 20,000, and the top three has soared to forty thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite is that the equipment used to play color movies is almost the price of Chinese cabbage. The set only needs 6,000 pieces and is available in unlimited quantities. This is the business of the capitalist. If the output of the playback equipment cannot keep up, naturally no one will buy a camera device. Because there are not a few cinemas that can be played, why not lick your own pot? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Dooling wants, Scott will send someone a device when he makes a call, but the price is not a dollar away from the 130,000, but One hundred dollars away from 200,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and looked at Scott. He looked at him with a little hair and said: "Money is not a problem. I hope to be there in a week. In addition, you can help me to pass a sentence to Mr. Mayor. I am planning to jointly produce a color film with Mr. Juan. There are a lot of pictures about the construction of the city of Irian in the movie. After the film is released, it will be played by Ilyan. To a very important promotional role."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
