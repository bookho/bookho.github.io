			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin returned to his home without a happy face. When he knew that Katrina had not left, let Dove inform her and be with her. The study talked for a while. Through a brief exchange of Du Lin, it was learned that Katerina belonged to the central military agent of the Imperial Military Intelligence Department. After the emperor went to the place, her rank would be temporarily raised by one level, and she had the power to mobilize local public resources. She was appointed to the west this time. Just think of ways to join Du Lin together to participate in the gathering of the gods, simply do a preliminary intelligence gathering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Military Affairs Office, including the Security Committee, has been very careful in dealing with domestic security issues. Each mission will have a detailed process, what each person is responsible for and how to implement it. There are plans and outlines. Katrina served as a search for early intelligence. She needed to mix with Doolin in the base of the Tushenism, and recorded the list of celebrities as much as possible to facilitate the forensic work of the military in the subsequent investigation. To this end, the military office specially sent an excellent and beautiful agent to Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, Du Lin thought that Magus might not be very concerned about the Tushenism, because after he reported the Tusiism to today, There was no feedback for almost a month, and even he was skeptical that there would be an official person behind the Tushen. But the arrival of Katrina made him realize that he might have guessed wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Doolin didn’t know that Magus was particularly nervous about the fact that he reported the Tudio because he went from down to Duolin’s report. On the top, there is no news from top to bottom. What does this mean? Explain that the local intelligence network, if there is no major problem of malfeasance, is already rotten. Even Magus suspects that the top of the western military region has been corrupted. This is very alarming. Last year, extreme religious organizations made a huge suicide incident, which brought a very bad impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Tushenism also makes a big deal, it is very likely that the empire will once again be turbulent, and it will lose face in the international arena. At the thought of the military, people may be infiltrated and corroded. After several rounds of deliberation, the cabinet decided to carry out the rotation of the western total military region. The two major generals in the western total military region, about fifteen colonels and almost forty After the school officials broke up, they were transferred to other military areas, and some of them had special status officers to be on the watch list. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the officers of the Western Military Region were transferred, the Imperial Army sent Catherine to the west and began to investigate the things of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I have already understood that someone will inform me before the next Turkic party begins. I will take you with you at that time, but I will not contact anyone before this." Du Lin refused Catalina made a request to contact the Tushen Church to deepen the relationship. Ghosts know that there is no way for the military to sweep out the people of the Tushen. If there are some scourges in the future, they will not be able to catch them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Du Lin is not dangerous at all. This is not his business. He does not need to take too much danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catalina brows, "Mr. Doolin, I hope that you don’t arbitrarily reject my proposal, it’s not for my personal benefit, It is not the interests of you or a certain department. This is for the collective interests of the entire west, the entire empire, and all the imperial citizens. From the description you submitted, I have been able to predict that there must be a big conspiracy of the gods, time for us. It’s not much.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If this is true, there is really nothing wrong with it, but...what does it have to do with me?”, Du Lin shook his head and stood up. "You can rest in the room, or you can find a place to rest yourself. I will go to the Imperial City tomorrow. I will have something to wait for me to come back." After that, Du Lin nodded slightly. "See you later!" "And then walked out the door. Katrina snorted and didn't chase it because she knew it would be meaningless to chase it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Du Lin had already got on the train and started to travel to the capital, a man was irritated by smoke, and many of the security agents who wore uniforms around him were constantly Repeatedly asking him questions, he answered it over and over again, and he kept answering it until there was no hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is one of the undercovers that the Security Council chose to enter as Dolin’s side. If you can’t find the right person and put it next to Doolin, They simply did not collect any direct and powerful evidence that Du Lin organized a criminal group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are hundreds of boring answers to various questions, he does not want to cooperate, but does not cooperate. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Tener Golden Robbery, some people were sent to prison as scapegoats for the public, and Prando was the best scapegoat. But this guy died in the gun battle at the dock, then Xiu En became the second most suitable object. First of all, being a member of a new party is definitely a sneaky person on the site of the old party. No one will say anything to him. Secondly, Xiu En also participated in the whole thing, which makes it inevitable to think of whether he has any special relationship with the Golden Robbery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, as the director of the Defence Investigation Bureau of the City of Tener, he did not implement the highest instructions from the cabinet during his tenure, and he did not eliminate the contraband transactions in the city of Tener, and even to some extent he could be said to be indulgent. Criminals in the city are guilty of crimes. Especially in certain time periods, the Doolin gang and Xiuen colluded to sell the contraband seized in the contraband warehouse directly to the city. All the people who run the bar and get the goods from Duolin All know that Du Lin’s wine comes from Xiu’en, and the wine of Xiu’en is to be punished by others. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the promotion of various comprehensive factors, Xiu’s gunshot wounds were directly treated as crimes of malfeasance, crime of destruction, involvement in gang crimes, etc. He was sentenced and imprisoned in the Tern district prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some time ago, Xiu En was released from prison. After he was released from prison, he saw Doolin’s news from the newspaper and wanted to go to the west to find Du Lin. After the imprisonment, Xiu En is also understood. Who is right in this world, who has money, who is right. He dared to slap his own chest and touch his own conscience to swear to everyone that everything he did was to ban Tener's contraband market and to catch more criminals without a bit of selfishness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I do? One by one in the court as a prosecution witness stood up and testified that he had never done anything. He had already broken his heart. He now only wants to get some money and live well. However, contrary to expectations, he just came out of the station and was controlled by two people and sent to the Imperial Capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schoen as an important "helper" during Du Lin's founding, is a very important role in the eyes of the Joint Investigation Team. Even the investigation team believed that Du Lin had given Du Lin a lot of help during his founding, and he was able to decisively go to the west after he was released from Xiu, and Xiuen’s relationship with Du Lin was good, and there may be secret links. . So the Security Council decided to control Xiu En, turn him into an undercover, and then put it to Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why there is such a choice is actually not a wishful thinking, but a practical reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Xiu En is not a Guar, he can not be a core member of the Doolin interest group, Du Lin’s exclusivity to the human race until now Still exists. In addition to Kevin's "excellent" lawyers, it is almost impossible for him to accommodate other people into his core circle. Then Xiu En may not have a heart and soul with Du Lin, and there is a possibility of being rebelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
