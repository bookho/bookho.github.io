			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman put down the newspaper in his hand, which is the cover of the lawsuit of Doolin and Donald and the Cape family. The sensation caused by this lawsuit has attracted almost Everyone’s gaze, whether it’s a small stall vendor or someone who goes into the giants, is very much concerned. In this world, the only thing that can attract people's attention is more than money. Although he thought that this thing was a bit strange, but he was so strange that he had nothing to do with him. He also thought of a joke. He asked casually, "What did Doolin do recently?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary of the Mennon immediately replied: "Dulin has been encircling the area recently, and he seems to say that he wants to build an empire's largest joint farm in the west...", Then the secretary said what Du Lin had done during this time. Du Lin has applied for a business license for her farm, called the “West Star Organic Farm”, and is said to have applied for a farming and animal husbandry company called “West Star Future Ranch”. Now many people in the west think that Doolin is crazy. So many businesses that can make big money don't do it. In the west, they are engaged in farm ranch. Are you afraid that there is a problem with your brain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Western Star Organic Farm?", the doorman sneered after reading the words one by one, as long as he does not open the mine, he is willing to plant the land Let him go to plant the land, just to solve some trouble for himself. The environment in the west has always been a big problem. Increasing the degree of greening is also one of the assessment criteria of government departments at all levels. If Du Lin can turn the whole west into a huge farm, that is the best thing. He saved a lot of trouble. Despite the feeling that Du Lin was a little bit confused, Ke Mennon asked, "How much land did he take now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has already taken one thousand two Thousands of hectares of land, and intend to continue to increase the amount of land in their hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mennon nodded and did not continue to pursue. Although the 12,000 hectares are not too small, there are still some distances compared to those of large farms. Moreover, the west is more land. He really wants to play with the farm and let him play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the compensation for those victims gone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, already put money It was handed to them..." The secretary said that he had dragged a tone here. Obviously, there was still nothing to say. The doorman immediately asked him to say what he wanted to say. The secretary continued to say: "I heard it recently. Some unsatisfactory winds, I don't know if it should be reported to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman took out a cigarette from his pocket. In fact, he did not smoke before, but after the formation of the Kadima Party, he was forced to learn to use cigarettes to reduce stress and pass the time. He lit the cigarette and nodded. "Tell it out and let me hear it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I monitor the payment of these compensations, I listen. Some people said that it is better to die than to live. I think this may have a series of problems." The secretary’s expression was very serious. He supervised 96,000 pieces and sent them to each of the victims. After the family's hands, when people found a restaurant on the side of the road to fill their stomachs, people around them were talking about this matter. The eight thousand is not a small amount, even for people living in the prosperous areas of the empire. This is equivalent to the savings of an ordinary family for more than ten years, but in the west, as long as one person is dead, . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people are sighing and even envious of the families of the victims. Although there is one member missing in the family, there is a lot more to change. They live now, and even the future, which is very attractive to the poor and backward western residents. In this era of not yet entering the pan-entertainment, people have always been the main entertainment activities, no one. The more poverty and backwardness, the more serious this phenomenon will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least every family in the West will have more than two children, and some families will even have five to six to eight or eight. The envelopes of the Buddhism believers will have more children, because they can marry more wives and give more offspring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people say that love is infinite, but actually love this thing is limited, when parents put their love on one or two children After that, there is no more love to divide for each child. Some of these children are pleasing to the eye, and some are not pleasing to the eye for a variety of reasons. Even God cannot guarantee that everyone's inner world is bright, and how can these people maintain their positive side in the process of the birth of complex humanity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can often see that some children are looking for a job to take responsibility for themselves when they are not young, but this is not necessarily the kind of child who is not loved by their parents. Life choices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, if a child can sell 8,000 in the West, I am afraid some families will be tempted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if they don’t use their own family to be a victim, they can also get these “subsidies” that are extremely important to them through adoption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coupled with the fact that some families are in desperate need of a lot of money, those members with high enough awareness can move past this level, so the policy of the door farmers in the west itself has huge hidden dangers and loopholes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities encounter tags that give life an accurate value, something unexpected will break out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of other things, the peasant may need to think for a while before he can understand the meaning behind it, but the content related to money, this past is dying Hummer packaging into a health horse from Mr. Ke Ma who cheated a sum of money, the response rate is still very fast. He immediately realized that it is not impossible to exchange money for life. Those gold diggers are already gambling on the future. If they find that their social security system will become a brand-new gold mine, it will be absolutely fatal to his next step. influences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The far things don’t say, just the compensation is enough to make the Kadima party go bankrupt, so this matter must be taken seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He indulged for a moment and said: "We need to identify deliberate casualties and natural casualties, and immediately suspend compensation and come up with a really effective Give me the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Monday morning, Doolin came to the state to participate in an auction, and found a copper mine in the Gregory Valley last week, copper The taste is at 2.1%, and the reserves currently being explored are OK. The gold digger who discovered the veins privatized the land and did not mine it himself, but went directly to the auction to auction. For most gold diggers, although they can guarantee a stable and sustainable income, they can face a lot of troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first trouble is to start the fund, and found that a vein needs a lot of money from the construction of the camp to the mining and the later transportation. This is not the case. Thousands of tens of thousands of pieces can be done. If these gold diggers have enough money in hand, then they are not likely to be gold diggers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second trouble is the threat from the robbers, the new veins mean new benefits, as long as the blood is washed and the private land re-enters the auction. In order, those big mine owners will pay their considerable commissions for this. Ordinary gold diggers do not have such anti-risk ability, they can not even passive defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
