			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear father:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pregnant, and as you wish, not Peter child. Although I know that the damn guy is arranged by you, I have never resentful against you. I understand your thoughts. The Codor family should not have low-lying descendants in this world, but unfortunately, you have done something, and some of you have missed it. As I said at the top of the letter, I am pregnant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the blood of the great Kodol family flowing in his body, but also the blood of the despicable Guar, in your words, He should be a mixed hybrid. You can control my life and control my husband, but you can't control me and my soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul is pure, I always believe in this, and this is what you and others are jealous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing this letter not to prove that I am purer than you, just want to tell you that your daughter Vivian, finally set foot on what you want Arrange the road for me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that some women stood up in the eastern part of the empire. They called themselves "the fighters of women's power" and people called them feminist movements. The hypocritical villains of the New Party also expressed positive views on this. I may not be a great politician, but I can become an outstanding female representative of the era. I am going to respond to the voice from the core of the Empire in the area of ​​the Tener, in the Cannes area, where the feminist movement is launched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just notified you and didn’t get the idea of ​​your consent. I understand that the feelings of politicians like you are far from being important to your children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, as your daughter, I hope that you can bless me and bless my career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that I have understood in my life. You don't argue, and you don't feel that you are modest. They just think that you are weak and incompetent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you could live long enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you illegitimate children can continue to harass you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you a healthy return soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love your daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Wei An. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler is a little embarrassed to put down the stationery in his hand, standing on the side of the ear. The content of this letter has been overdone, which is simply a bottle of poison to the already embarrassing Governor. The doctor said that the last thing the Governor should do is to have aerodynamic anger, which will affect the changes in his blood pressure, which may make his condition worse. There is no such thing as a good word in Miss Vivian's letter. It is something that makes people angry. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the butler waits for the Governor’s swearing to replace his physical movements to vent his anger, the Governor’s adult actually laughed? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sneer of hatred and anger after extreme anger? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or is he really laughing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler quietly looked up and glanced at it. He glanced at the Governor’s slack skin, the lack of congestion and the ruddy blood, and he saw that he was flashing A bright, shiny look and a real smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is really laughing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor is biased in his head, "Let me stay alone for a while!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housekeeper Immediately retired, standing at the door, he said: "I will knock at the door after five minutes and come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the doctor and the governor himself In any case, he can't be more than five minutes away from people's sights. The Governor is still very fond of his own awkward life. He does not want to embrace God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the door was closed, there was only the Governor’s adult in the room. He couldn’t help but laugh. He rarely saw him laughing in recent years. The joy is almost close to the laughter of arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every family wants to have a boy who is the inheritor of the cause and the successor of the blood. After having the boy, they hope to be a girl, and Vivian is looking forward to the world. She is the favorite daughter of the Governor, and those illegitimate children cannot compare with her. Even if the Governor’s adult wants her to marry a well-known nobleman, she finally agreed to her request and let her marry Peter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows how much the Governor's adult loves Vivian, and the favor of even marriage, which has a certain weight in politics, has been abandoned by him, just to make Vivienne happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he did something that made her happy, for example, it made people break a piece of Peter’s egg and let the doctor cut off his reproductive system. One of the most important tubes. He did this in order to protect Vivienne, not Vivian. He wanted to avoid having a descendant of a bloodline humble. Yes, how can the old man’s wisdom not see Peter’s purpose of approaching Vivian? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he used this method to "protect" Vivian, and he believes that one day Vivian will understand that this day has indeed arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the place where Vivienne’s “hybrid hybrid” comes from, the Governor’s adult does not care very much. The higher the status, the higher the level of contact. The more you can understand that the war between the old and the new parties has already begun to show signs of ending. The old party stereotypes maintain the "purity" of the core circle. Simply put, if it is not the old aristocracy of the empire, it is absolutely impossible to enter this core circle and cannot become the top and core figures of the old party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article alone limits the future development of the old party. On the other hand, the new aristocrats of the New Party’s empire, they did implement the concept of “non-elite not high-level” in secret, but the range available for them to choose is too great. Regardless of the origin, no matter what the past, as long as it is now recognized as an elite, there is an opportunity to enter the top of the new party and enter the real core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old-fashioned should be the tradition, not the stereotyped prejudice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the old party’s momentum is still able to go hand in hand with the New Party is not because the old party is so powerful, they are just eating old. The accumulated capital for hundreds of years was slowly consumed by them. One day they finished eating the old ones. At that time, it was the time when the New Party was fully dominant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Governor’s opinion is very clear. The world is ultimately a new party. It belongs to the new party that does not care about the origin, does not care about the ingredients, only absorbs the elite, not Belongs to the old party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, he knows that this will happen, but he can’t change his position because he can’t do it too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he hopes that some of his next generation can stand up and become another way. It can be said that this is to put the eggs in the second basket, and it can be said that it is against the future and speculation on the new party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed that Vivian had mentioned the feminist movement in the letter, and had to say that the state of Cannes was too remote, and she was so remote that she even had the feminist movement. Who is the initiator, and no one is noticed by the participants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, she didn't notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The founder of the feminist movement is one of the oldest party’s five giants, and there are many women from the big aristocratic family. It is necessary to know that women who are born in ordinary families are not busy with work to earn money to support their families. They are busy eating their lives among children. How many ordinary women have time, money, and charisma to do this kind of obvious effort. thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, the feminist movement itself is a preliminary match between the old party’s enlightened person and the new party. Everyone is trying to find a new way out, so These women should stand on the wave of the times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor is very happy, the Codor family finally has a clear person, although it is possible that her "understanding" is out of anger against the past life, right now The anger encountered, the anger of the future. But at least, she is right! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knocking on the door awakened the Governor’s meditation, he said “come in”, the housekeeper pushed the door and stood at the door, gently Closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take a letter and a pen, I want to write a letter to Peter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housekeeper Immediately remove the stationery from the cabinet, bow down to the desk, and quickly record what the Governor said. Finally, he read the contents of the letter and asked the Governor to read it again before loading the envelope, dropping the sealing wax and stamping the mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter was handed over to the person in the manor who was responsible for the external contact later, and then, under the carrying of a driver, crossed two The city, at noon the next day, was sent to Tener and appeared in Peter's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
