			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I go out and breathe?", the doorman knocked on the door and watched an officer outside the door complain. "I already have enough I haven't left the building for more than ten days. I want to go outside to breathe fresh air, even if there is no problem at the door.", in order to guard the doorman not let him have too much contact with the outside world, he is now The house where the house is living has no windows. The commander allows him to walk around the building, but he cannot leave and cannot approach the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has almost no way to contact anyone, even when there is a call, people here think he used a whisper in normal communication, immediately He hung up the phone and warned him that he is still a suspect who is seriously suspected. Before the mess in the west is completely smooth, he can't have a connection with the outside world. These people even asked him to say only the simple words "yes" and "not" on the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer closed his door with a blank expression, facing the door panel, the doorman sighed heavily, and it was troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can only rely on his own hopes to be able to guess his mind at the moment, evaporate the executives of the West Mine, only This will make him safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when the door farmers considered how to contact the outside world, the other three executive members of the West Mine also made a decision. As their companions said yesterday, the situation has not deteriorated, and they have tried to leave the empire before they are controlled. They stayed in this position for more than a decade, and they have already taken enough benefits in these years to allow them to include their family and future generations to squander generations. There is no need to stay here for the power of collapse. Waiting to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid the surveillance they might encounter, they held a dance to celebrate the annihilation of the Freedom Front and the mining trade in the West could continue normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dressing room, the four executives met again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that someone is monitoring us, we must speed up the action, and for three hours, Federer’s traitor will stand in the spotlight. Wait for him to take him. After those shit words are finished, I am afraid we have no time.", the guy who had a "transaction" with Doolin sat in a chair, and he picked up a fader that was specially used to cut hair and walked in the middle of his head. Pushed a line in the past. A large, well-maintained hair fell to the ground, revealing some gray hair roots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other three knew for a moment what the guy was doing. Since someone was monitoring them, their departure must be done without alarming anyone. There is nothing better than disguising yourself during the dance. So they also began to use the tools found in the dressing room to change their appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man quickly turned himself into a bald head, and even his eyebrows were shaved by him. He used cosmetics to darken his complexion. It's a bit like a provincial lover. When he took off his coat under the inexplicable gaze of others and took out a suit similar to a mascot from the box next to him, one of them couldn't help but ask, "Are you ready?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave a dignified moment. "Whether you leave the empire, I will leave the empire. I have arranged for my family to leave yesterday night. They are not yet under surveillance, at least I know this. You'd better be able to find a way to inform them and then join in the federation." As he spoke, he put on the seemingly childish clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a large plush toy jacket with the image of a miner. The exaggerated image of the miner is full of cartoon visual effects, and he can't directly see him. He looked outside through a large hole in the miner's mouth. Even if he saw his eyes from the outside, he couldn't tell who this person was. Only by letting him take off the suit can he see his appearance. But at such a dance, who will go to a staff member wearing cartoon plush clothes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other three are still secretly silent, but this old thing is really worthy of the heart, such a big family business said don’t want it, I have already sent my family away. At the same time, they are also considering how to tell their families to leave the empire as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guilt and reluctance in the heart is definitely not the language or expression that can be revealed. They lived in this empire for decades, from the aristocratic period to today’s new In the times, they have feelings for everything here, and half of their family business is here, and they can’t take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villas, manors, artworks, and various real estates and valuable luxury art will be the collection of others, and their beloved things will become the darling of the auction. This makes their hearts are bleeding. Why are you not able to get down? Perhaps they felt their attachment to the empire when making a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four men quickly changed their clothes, and one of them asked in a coat, "Why are you only a miner? Why are we all stones?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Idiot..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A miner walked out of the dressing room along with three rickety gold ore, and everyone who saw them reported Smile, some children come up and touch them, just let the children feel that the experience is very poor, because these cute cartoon characters did not give them a positive response, but instead let their parents roll away as their parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miner looked back and saw the second gold ore behind him. "You can't say them, if you bring their parents, we will run all the time." Can't fall." After he finished this sentence, he continued to move forward, but in his mind, Du Lin explained the things he had told him last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, he is a bit confused about why Doolin wants to do this. If he really wants to let these people disappear, he can find a chance to use the other’s ability. They are all gone, can't they do it, why should they spend a lot of time helping them to leave the empire at this time and go to the federation, not to a farther country. Although he feels that the federation is the best choice in his heart, at least the social environment there is good, the rich man dominates everything, but he does not understand what it is for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also called his family last night, and he only knew that his family had already taken the passenger ship to the Federation, probably in three days. Will arrive in the Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more strange Du Lin’s behavior, the more he reflects, is this a trap? But Dooling did not deceive him, because Doolin arranged a naval train to send them to the West Coast to take the navy's warships to the Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a feeling in his heart that Du Lin is using himself. But at this time, what can I do besides being used? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just after the four of them came out from the back door, a car slowly approached them, a military vehicle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military vehicle is wider than an ordinary family car. There are three rows of seats in the car. There are two soldiers sitting in the front main driver's seat and the passenger seat. The soldier sitting in the passenger seat shook the window and snorted. "Get off the clothes and have the clothes for you in the third row."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The four didn't have any hesitation. They took off their cartoon jackets and got into the car. In the third row of seats, they found four military uniforms. After they put on these military uniforms and put on the military caps, they looked It is also like a soldier, at least a bare head. The only thing that may not be like is their age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, no one in Van Lille will block such military vehicles that are all military. First of all, military vehicles are not easy to get, just in case With the gendarmerie inspection, the soldiers in the cab can also cope with the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as they were sitting in the military vehicle at the station, a car passed by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I already know what to say." Federer reversed the three notes on the armrest between the two seats, above It lists some of the cores that he needs to say when he speaks, and how some difficult questions may arise. In order to write down the content, he spent four days, almost every minute and every second in the memory of the content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellis took those lectures in his hands, and he randomly asked questions from inside to ask Federer. The upcoming press conference is very important. It was decided whether Du Lin’s plan could be successfully completed and could not tolerate even a single mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as this press conference is over, the West will soon calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and by bit, Federer, who had slept for a while in the hotel room, was woken up by Doolin, changed his clothes and followed him behind Du Lin. It took the elevator to the third floor of the hotel, where there is a hall. The moment they pushed the door open into the hall, they almost couldn't open their eyes when they flashed the magnesium lamp. This time, not only reporters in the empire, but also journalists from other countries. After all, enslaving the nationals as slaves is a matter of stimulating the sensitive nerves of the country. They must come over and understand what is going on, to facilitate those. The big man makes the right judgment in international affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat on the left hand side of Federer, and the position on the right hand side was empty. Federer didn’t bother to think about why someone was late, he squinted. Standing up and waving at the reporters in the hall, he said, "I am very grateful to everyone for being able to show their faces to this press conference. I am here today, and I will announce some horrible things that you don’t know. Public. Maybe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
