			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, I heard that you took all the liquidity from the bar, didn't you?", Coulomb rushed into Juan's study, he I walked back and forth a few steps. "Do you know that I can't even get a thousand dollars in hand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan smashed Rubbing your eyes and putting down the book in your hand is a way of self-regulation. Whenever he needs to think quietly, he opens a book and after a while he can calm down. He seems to be reading, actually thinking, and he thinks this method is useful and meaningful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took off the glasses on the bridge of the nose and put them in the glasses case. At this age, his vision has begun to decline. The flower mirror can be seen clearly. His slow movements made Cullen attack again, and Cullen couldn't stand some strange habits of Juan. Sometimes the more you are anxious, the slower he is, but when he is in a hurry, you can only follow the rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A thousand pieces can't be put together, indicating that you can still make a few hundred pieces. If I remember correctly, all the wine in the bar is our own." If you brew in the home workshop, you only need to sign your name to pick up the goods from the warehouse. As for other foods such as fruit food, do you need to use a thousand dollars?", Juan said when he said it was here. "I forgot, it is already at the end of the month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the largest bar operator and wine drink provider in Irian, Juan is still a very reputable businessman, he The bar never needs to pay cash directly, and the monthly end of each month will be closed. In fact, this is not because Juan deliberately pressed the money to make it difficult for those businessmen. Almost all the big businessmen in the world have this habit. The purpose of doing this is to "stabilize." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the fruit merchant who provided fruit for the Juan Bar suddenly did not do it, or was bought by someone or other circumstances, and suddenly stopped. Provided fresh fruit to Juan. If there is no effective way to restrain him, then only Juan is alone. However, if you press the price for one month, you can avoid this situation to the utmost. If anyone wants to do it or if it is temporarily provided for other things, he will imagine the month that was pressed by Juan. How can the payment be recovered? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a kind of non-active integrity, unless the provider's reputation and status can be equal to that of Juan, this phenomenon will always exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand pieces are only enough to pay for fruit, but the problem is that the bar can provide not only fruits and drinks, but also juice, seafood, beef and mutton, and various cooked breads, such as wheat, which add up to a thousand. The block is simply not enough. Coulomb was also prepared to check out the guys when they checked out that the bar had no money. When he asked where the money went, he came here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that Juan is working on a big plan recently, putting all his energy into it, just like a demon. The money in the family has always been managed by Juan alone. Others don't know the specific situation, but today Cullen comes here to find out that Juan wants money to get rid of those money, he also wants to ask the family. Where did the money go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also realized the seriousness of what Juan did recently, even the money that the bar used to make money was taken away. The money is No, I still have to do anything, always give a statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cullen feels that there is nothing wrong with doing this. Even many people think that his approach is not wrong, but he never thought about it. The money is Juan’s. It’s Juan’s alone. The money is not Coulomb, not someone else, not anyone in this family, they have no share! This money is Juan's own. At least until he is not dead, only he has the right to control how the money is used. Where it is used, others have no right to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, many rich people are faced with such a situation, they are very rich, and they will give their families enough pocket money every once in a while, they never think about it. Give the real "money" in your hands to these people. Only after they die, these property rights and powers will be distributed to the majority according to the will of fairness or unfairness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same wealthy family members often have an unrealistic illusion, they will feel that the money in the hands of the rich, there is also a copy of them... . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very troublesome, and this is the fuse of conflicts within all families - the imbalance in wealth distribution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cullen’s face is very uncomfortable when entering the room. His voice is a bit low and some changes. “They will find me here to ask for their payment, and I can't even get a thousand pieces. What do you say I should do? Don't give them? Or take the wine to pay the debt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan is also a little impatient, and he has devoted himself to the big things that have become a partner with the George family. He has lost sight of these small profits. In the past two days, he invited an expert who specializes in filming on Xie Lisi Street to come back and specifically asked the theater. The expert told him straightforwardly that any theater would certainly make money if it could maintain a 30% attendance rate. If it can maintain 60%, it will be rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yaoxing Empire’s box office is divided into time-based steps. Twenty percent of the total box office receipts in the first three weeks are attributable to the theater, and the fourth week is Fifty-five percent of the total box office receipts in the twelfth week were theaters, and all of the show box office revenues at the thirteenth week were owned by the theater. With the exception of a handful of films with agreements, the rights to show most movies are permanent, which means how long you can put them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 37 movies were released throughout the year, and the highest-selling movies from the release to the twelfth Monday were more than 4.7 million. Among them, more than 2.5 million are the income of the producers, and more than 2 million are the income of the cinema, and some of the income is counted as taxes and various expenses. There are more than 500 theaters registered in the country so far, and the average income of each movie theater in this movie is 4,000 to 5,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Juan heard the data, he almost gave up the business, but he continued to patiently listen to the expert to continue to analyze for him. Last year, a total of 37 films were released, some of which were hot and some were unattended. According to statistics, a total of 3,913,300 gross box office was generated, roughly calculating the average release period of each cinema. The income is around 30,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a lot? It doesn't matter, in fact, the real income of each theater is very different from this average. For example, the income of cinemas in remote areas is lower than this number, but the income of cinemas in some developed areas is much higher than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan spent a little more money and got a box office calculation for a movie theater in a developed area. At least there are more than 40,000 pieces, and there are more than 50,000 or 60,000 places. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, he would try to build three to five high-middle and low-end cinemas in the center of each city, holding one hundred and fifty Home to two hundred cinemas, the income of one year is two or three million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, some of the theater’s revenue comes from “no rights show”, which means revenue after the twelfth week. There are some places where the theater deliberately reduces the number of screenings and raises the fare so that most people look down. After the end of the screening period, they will do all kinds of so-called preferential activities, and return the filmmakers back to the cinema. The attendance rate may be lower than that of the normal theaters, but their income is their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
