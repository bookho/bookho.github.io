			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dudu has never seen Igor, if he knows that the guy who harassed him at the station is Igor, maybe now he is driving the other’s car On the way back to the city of Otis. After a little hesitation, the Buddha accepted Igor's invitation. After they returned to Igor's office and sat down, the other party poured a cup of tea for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Dudu is still considering how to get Igor out of silence. After all, the other party is the director of the telegraph office. If anything happens, it will definitely not be a small matter. Not only will the local city hall scrutinize the matter, but the local gang will also move. From the official tracing, the Buddha is not worried, except for those idiots who know that they are doing things according to the rules, other things will not be understood at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was worried about the gangs, and as one of them he knew the "terrible" degree of these gangs. Perhaps an inconspicuous tramp on the roadside, or an old man who seems to be resting, may be one of their eyeliners. When I was in Tener, if it wasn't for Camille who caught his little nephew through a tramp, it would be impossible for them to be caught off guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although that event was finally solved under Kevin’s force and the tramp’s mistakes, it’s enough Let everyone wake up, in every corner of the city, there is a pair of eyes watching and watching the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coffee tray touched the coffee table and let him come back. He leaned forward slightly, said a thank you, and leaned back to the sofa. Backrest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Igor stood opposite him, holding a coffee cup in his hand, hesitating for a while and then said his request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I encountered such a thing, the Buddha felt a bit fresh and a bit disgusting. He pretended to be a very interested look and discussed it. After the details, I got up and said goodbye. They agreed to have dinner at Igor's house at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the telegraph office, they all contacted the two contractors that Natalie had contacted. Their attitude was very good, not only the entertainment of Dudu. Properly, even intend to take him out to play. After declining their kindness, they all invited them to send representatives to the city of Otis to go on a field trip before making a conclusion. Because the current Audis has new changes every day, these people's old ideas about Otis have not caught up with the real situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such circumstances, they also quoted the old memories of the city of Otis, both for them and for the Otis City Hall, which is unfair and irresponsible. The two contractors immediately agreed, saying that they would immediately send people to the city of Otis to conduct field visits, and finally contact the Otis City Hall directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After contacting the two contractors respectively, the sky gradually darkened. After the invitation of one of them was declined, the Buddha agreed with him and Igor. Good time, found his home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His home is in the West Side of Nam Lindes and is also the Upper Town. Here, close to the main stream of the Xiu Xiu Duen River, real estate developers and the local city hall in order to improve the layout of the urban environment, they dug an artificial lake next to the Xicheng District, introducing the water from the Xiu Duo River into the artificial lake. in. Therefore, Xicheng District has become the upper city. Although there is no mountain to rely on, the whole city is surrounded by Lindos Lake. The people living here are not rich and expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at least 20 meters between each household, and each household has a small yard, between ordinary houses. Between the villa and the villa. Before knocking on the door, Buddha saw Igor's neighbor, an old man who looked like he was about 60 years old. He coughed hard, the old man was indifferent, and he looked at another dark window, then sorted out his bow tie, holding a bottle of wine and ringing the door of Igor's house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door is his wife, a very gentle woman, the smile is very kind, not old, looks like thirty-five six years old. She was very enthusiastic about taking a pair of slippers for Dufo, and pointed out the wardrobe room for him, and thanked him, and took the wine he brought from the hands of Dufo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha looked at the house, the decoration in the house was not bad, it was a little worse than luxury, but it was definitely not a low-end. There was no sound of children playing in the room, which made him feel a little more secure. Igor greeted him in his home attire and brought him into the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a TV set in the living room. This is still what he and Du Lin learned. It is playing the program produced by "Imperial Star Media Company" every month. There are two issues. This period should be the latest, because the contents of the Buddha have not been seen, the place where the ghosts of Otis even sell TV sets. He saw two guys in suits pointing at each other's nose and licking each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be a political program. Before Du Lin left Irian, not only did the New Party contact him, but also the old party members contacted him. They all expressed their desire to go to his program and promote themselves to the middle class and the top of the entire empire. Your own political philosophy. Du Lin naturally agreed to their request, but in order to increase the hot spot, under the approval of both sides, the new party and the old party were put together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the program is exactly the same as that of Doolin. The two sides only calmed down for a while and then began to swear each other, attacking each other’s governance philosophy and political ambitions. Attack the program of the other party. Although the show is a bit confusing, people have to say that people like to watch this thing. Perhaps they don't like to watch the reason why they are even beaten, but because people find so-called politicians, but they don't really have much difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Igor is sitting on the couch, very relaxed, holding a muffin that he took a bite in his hand, pointing at the TV The old party members said: "These people are full of old ideas in the past. They even want to artificially create an 'elite class' for the current society, thus dividing the socially confused class concept. It’s a retrogression of the times!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that Igor is very opposed to this idea, but what he doesn’t know is that he is watching the show like him. The middle class and the upper class do not completely think that this is the wrong behavior. Some people, and quite a few people think that this idea is very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the true mainstream voice, as the main contributor to society and the elite that supports all aspects of society, as the largest group of vested interests of the empire, There are always some people who will have a "superior" idea. The idea put forward by the politician of the old party on television just satisfies the social spiritual needs of these people, and they hope that they are different from ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wu’s watched the TV for a long time. Some of these shows are made with tape, some are going to the scene, and he has some of these things. A little understanding. For Igor's statement, he just smiled and thought about it. "If there is no such demand, he will not propose this idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what Du Lin told his buyer market, politicians, people and politics, and there is no difference between the market and the market. When the market needs something, the merchants will take the initiative to sell what, when there is such a demand in the society, these politicians will sell these concepts in line with a certain group, hold the votes of these people, and turn them into themselves. Party supporters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Igor looked at the Buddha with amazement. It can mean that the other party has a certain understanding of politics. He was just amazed, and did not refute anything. Soon, the political program became a melodrama with a slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this era of severe family entertainment, this sitcom has become the driving force for most people to buy tape. In a previous return visit survey, 63% of purchasers thought that it would be best to have a single roll of tape every week, all used to play the drama, they are willing to do more for each month. A hundred dollars. It is said that Doolin has already agreed, and Freena is preparing for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a minute or two of laughter, Igor laughed. He smiled and shook his head. Things can erode people's souls. Do you believe that? If one day, you can see these things every day, I believe that many people don't even have a job, just stay at home and watch them."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just finished, his wife came out from the living room and said, "You can eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Igorshu With a sigh of relief, I patted my legs and stood up, leading the Buddha to the restaurant. As explained, “The children have gone to my parents. There are only three of us this evening!”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the trio sat down, Igor did not look like he was in normal time, very humorous and very considerate, always able to tease everyone laughing . If you don't hear the other person say it, then Buddha feels that it is his own illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people have high mood swings, they are always easy to drink, and Igor replaced the fruit wine brought by Dufo with the height of his collection. Alcohol, three people have some drunkenness. Especially his wife, who drank the most, had a bit stiff eyes. When he tried to stand up and add a little main dish for everyone, he sat back and fell on the table and lost consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come, help me.", Igor took a napkin and wiped his mouth, and waved at the Buddha. "Help me put her." Go to the bedroom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo also wiped his mouth and hands, and the two together added Igor’s wife, went upstairs, and threw it. The bed in the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
