			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We made it!", Graf held a lot of coins and some crumpled change in his hand, excitedly holding Du Lin, and still Hey, kissed Du Lin’s face. He is now in a state of madness. If someone told him a week ago that he could easily earn sixty dollars a week, he would need to take out forty dollars as an investment. Then he will use his fist to break the guy's nose, then spit a mouthful of water on the guy's face, and then put a few feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if this person is Doolin, then it is another matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duling extra resistance and this guy like a bear is too close, struggling to get rid of Graf’s arms, hiding to the side with a cloak The saliva on the face. Although he disguised Graf's kind performance, his face was as clear as Graf's smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough... yes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one that he saw in the dream of the great man he had experienced in his life, one of which was very impressive. At that time, when the big man was just an ordinary little person like him, he asked his boss how to earn the most money in the shortest time. His boss handed him a copy of the Chinese Criminal Law and told him that all the most profitable roads are in this book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps reality is different from dreams, such as the environment, such as technology, such as language, such as culture. But there is the same thing, that is the truth! The more things that the law does not allow, the more it needs to be a huge risk, but at the same time the huge risks will be fed by the risk-bearers beyond the huge returns that people can imagine! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When workers do not break the law, but how many workers can stand out from the underlying society through labor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sale is not allowed to sell, and the church is called a "demon-filled" high-alcohol law, but there is a result that everyone knows. "The closer you are to the devil, The fuller the pocket!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short week...and, to be precise, one day, they earned a full cost of less than ten dollars. ten bucks! ! For the great Empire Star Coin, even if you cross a certain threshold a little step, it seems that it is not something that cannot be tolerated! Just go back and go to the church a few times to confess, just believe that God will forgive them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf, who had been excited for a while, had already smashed the door of the bedroom with his fist. It seems that only through violence can he calm his heart. He grabbed a small half of the base of the original wine placed on the wall and poured it in one bite. The bitterness and the spicy taste made him feel awkward. He threw the bottle on the ground and gasped and looked at Doolin, which made Du Lin step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This damn guy, won't... He touched the knife in his pocket, it shouldn't, or he would kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Durin, who is somewhat sorrowful and ready to swear to protect himself, has made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next, what do we do?", Graf waved his arm and his body was full of surprises caused by huge profits, even now There is a dozen girls who can flatten one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a sigh of relief and sat down on the bed. "Of course it is to expand sales and build our own brand. Now there are two things for you." Go and do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf slammed his chest, and Pengpeng's muffled sound made Du Lin wonder if this guy would die one day, "First, You are going to tell you the bar for the goods. The previous one is the trial, which is used for market research. The official sales still need to wait a few days. Also, don’t promise them the bulk of the request, tell them that our goods come from In foreign countries, there are a limited number of bars, but there are too many bars to be supplied, and each bar can have up to two boxes per week.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tnel is very close to the border, taking a steam locomotive I was able to leave the Yaoxing Empire, so under the calm sunshine of Tener, there were smuggling gangs of all sizes. It’s just that ordinary people can’t find the world and can’t participate in it, including Du Lin and Graf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why there is a limited supply, Du Lin also explained to this big guy, and the large-scale distribution can quickly get a lot of profits, but it can’t Increase the value of goods. Only limited sales, let people have a stupid idea that "this thing is really rare, will it be because it is very precious", can quickly increase the value of the product. Turn the two kinds of fruit wine from a "delicious and peculiar" high-quality wine into a high-end brand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the brand effect is formed, there is no need to work hard to increase the value of the goods, and the market and consumers will help them to complete this very complicated and difficult for the company. the process of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second thing, we need a secret purchase channel, large quantities of wine from people you know. They will definitely guess that we may have found a different purification method than Dragon Blood. Once this happens, then We only have two ways to go, either to leave the Yaoxing Empire and then spend the rest of our lives in the pursuit. Or we can find a place to end up with ourselves, so as not to bring trouble to our families!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, find a way to contact the contact of a foreign winery in Tener, and purchase them from them in the name of a trading company. Before you contact them, come to me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole Yaoxing Empire brewing and selling high-alcohol has become an important means for some families to make profits. A cup of high-altitude wine ranges from five to five, and the profit here exceeds 100. The three hundred is enough for the big families to do everything they can to get a low-grade wine to become a high-alcohol production. With families whose assets are counted in tens of millions or even billions, the two of them who are less powerful than the ants can't even do it. They can only be slaughtered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said very carefully, Graf also listened very seriously, which is precisely why Du Lin is willing to continue to cooperate with Graf. This big man has the courage to gamble, but also very wise, knowing that he is not a smart person, so he is willing to listen to the arrangement of smart people, not his own. If he is a Hulai, Du Lin may have disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, before he disappeared, he didn't mind sending Graf a ride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the value of distillation purification is probably enough to make all the consortium capital in the world tremble, it is not a craft that can make a fortune, but A knife that can take your life anytime, anywhere! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Arranging Graf’s mission, Du Lin also went to work on his own task. His task was simple, registering a trademark and a trading company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his design, low-alcohol should be imported from abroad, although the price may increase by 10% to 15%, but compared to Their profits are still far behind. Since doing so, it will not cause the attention of the whole Imperial wine merchants because of the large amount of high-alcoholic wines. In the early stage of any technological monopoly, it is necessary to ensure the development of awkwardness, and only have a certain capital. After that, when you are qualified to sit on the same table with the big capitalist, you can stand up and wave your hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Graf, Du Lin took the ten-dollar to go up with the Teign Business Association of the Stars Empire Chamber of Commerce. In this world, there are various organizations. Some of these organizations have replaced the government. Duties. On the one hand, the Yaoxing Empire has just emerged from the war. If the government wants to take over part of the labor union's work and needs huge human and financial resources, the government can't get the money. On the other hand, the victorious Yaoxing Empire has realized that the backward political system and military system cannot make the Yaoxing Empire go further. At the beginning of the reform of this political system, the society has already experienced instability. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If rashly withdraws some of the folk power into the hands of the government, it is very likely to trigger social unrest, and there is a huge conflict in the demise of this empire, even It is a civil war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for the Chamber of Commerce, the union is also good, in the face of various organizations Yaoxing Empire, on the one hand, constantly stroking, telling them that the Empire will not move their cake . On the one hand, it is also actively learning to absorb the management methods and operations of trade union organizations, and is ready to seize power after the empire has emerged from the turmoil of change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now the registered company, registered trademarks and other business practices are completely controlled by the Imperial Chamber of Commerce, and there is no relationship with the official government of the Empire. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s precisely because of the characteristics of the merchants in the Chamber of Commerce, so as long as there is money, there is nothing that can’t be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example... buy a pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After spending two dollars to sign up for a trademark and spending four dollars to sign up for a company, the remaining money is stuffed into the pocket of the client. in. The middle-aged man in the suit and slicked the face of the oily face finally had no rigid business, and was replaced by a smile from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., if you want to buy a wine label, you need at least 5,000 stars." The staff decided to sell their dignity for four dollars. After all, this is his ten-day salary, not a small amount, and all he needs to pay is a smile. "You should know that many wineries have violated the theocracy and imperial laws and secretly brewed high-alcohol. Bishop Green was very dissatisfied with this. Under his pressure, the winery is now issued very strict." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He explained a little about why he had to get a legal license for five thousand pieces. After all, the theocracy law prohibits the drinkers from drinking. Under the influence and pressure of the theocracy law, the directors of the high-level chambers of the Chamber of Commerce decided to take a little control when issuing the winery card and take care of the church's face as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
