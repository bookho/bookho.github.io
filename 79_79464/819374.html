			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Minister of Finance is taking a break and rests in the office. He has a lot of work, and occasionally he can have a little rest time as much as possible to deal with the heavy work. He has 20 minutes this time, and will host a meeting after 20 minutes. A series of problems caused by the "century fraud" need to be resolved. Now he is responsible for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no five minutes left in the slumber, the phone ring on the desk rang, he squeezed his nose and climbed up from the sofa, some troubles I made a phone call. Anyone who is woken up at rest will not have any good temper, whether he is a tramp or an empire's deputy finance minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Minister, I think we should temporarily suspend tomorrow’s trial, There may be some problems." The voice of the deputy minister in the receiver is very familiar. It is the voice of Amp. He had a relationship with Amp, and Amp left him with a deep impression, so this time he asked people to remind Clark. If you can't find the right person to detect the case, you can consider Amp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he has not had a good impression of Amp in the past. It has dragged on for more than two months and has not made much progress so far, even if he The guy named Du Lin may have a relationship with the case, and it is just a suspicion. This made him very embarrassed. The person he was looking for was as confusing as the idiot for two months without any gain. The ugly is not Amp, but his deputy minister, so his tone is not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have any new ideas? Mr. Ampu, I have to tell you that you have no time. We are all waiting for this trial. The final result, I hope you can give the public and public opinion a satisfactory account!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when I caught Hoodock, some people thought that this case It can be over. With the mastermind and the planner, the official has no loss, enough to explain the past in the face. As for the 70 million funds lost by the stockholders, can they be recovered, and there is not much relationship with whether or not the case is closed. Many people support this idea, but others are opposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70 million is not a small amount, if you can really recover the money, except for the part that is paid to the shareholders, the rest are "Scrapping money" should be confiscated. They also took out a compensation plan and paid for it according to the price listed on the first day of DreamWorks. It only needs to take out more than 12 million yuan, and the remaining more than 50 million can be topped. How much can a state's taxation do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you...how much is it in your pocket? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was because of differences that the case was not immediately closed, but the investigation team was allowed to detect it. Two months later, the opinions of the investors have grown, and with the demonstrations of the past few days, those who have objections have begun to suffer. They are not concerned about the 70 million problem, but their own political life. The unscrupulous reports of the media made them have to face this, and they can be said to have been shackled by media public opinion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a question of Doolin’s question, but it’s a kidnapping of public opinion. So no matter how much the case itself has nothing to do with Doolin, how much is the relationship, the trial must be carried out as planned. As for whether or not something can be judged, it is not important. What is important is that someone will carry this person for it. That is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...", Amp in the receiver argued, "But tomorrow Du Lin is likely to be offended, he hired Kevin, at us Without knowing, Kevin intervened in the case earlier and became his defense lawyer, plus some of them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Patience is listening. He is a politician. He is not a detective. He is not a detective. He has nothing to do with what Anpp said. He has aggravated his tone and is already a bit rude. "Please don't tell me, you should say to yourself, or tell the judge at the trial. Chadulin is your request, saying that you can't check it, you said it now. , Amp, this is not a play!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will continue to pay attention to this matter, I am waiting for good news on your side in the emperor, I still have something, goodbye! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp’s earphones came shortly after the busy tone, and the operator unplugged the connection between him and the Ministry of Finance. How is the Treasury so busy? Maybe a number that has ended the call will occupy a line that is not much? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang up the phone, Amp sat on the sofa, he wiped his face, holding his head, shaking in tandem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a strong sense of foreboding, this time it’s going to be a big problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still too anxious! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is too light for the political issues of the Imperial Capital! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When used to be in the local area, no matter what amp said, the local chief executive would cooperate with him, would not give him a deadline, and would not set obstacles for him. As long as he can find the criminal and catch the criminal, it can be said that the whole society is supporting him and cooperating with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the imperial capital, he felt that his hands and feet were tied up. This place cannot be checked. The file is not eligible for reading. Some people will be from time to time. Call to say something if there is no threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that there is nothing wrong with the direction of his initial investigation. He has been chasing the jewellery company and has been able to dig up Duolin’s old bottom. Once he proves that he is the mastermind and planner of the Golden Robbery, the 70 million problem is not a problem. By then, the Imperial Bank and the New Party will give him two choices, either hanged or compensate for the loss of more than 31 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to maximize self-help, he must use more than 70 million funds in his hand to fill this loophole. Once he used the money, it naturally took the fact that he planned the fraud, and he couldn’t fly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the urgency of time and the lack of cooperation between the parties, coupled with the strong protection of Irian’s local Doolin, made him unable to do so in a short time. Pulled down Dulin. Give him a year or two, he will definitely grab Du Lin's tail, and then pick him up and let the public know his true appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing he lacks is time, time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he made a new plan, used Juan’s death to make a fuss, and tried to find Du Lin’s body, so that Du Lin could not go unpunished. He has time to slowly pick up the detained Doolin and dig out all his secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what he has to do, not to say that this is an inevitable process. He was all ready to give up this line at any time. Suddenly, the Emperor’s public opinion changed, and with political factors, he did not push Du Lin to the edge of the cliff. Instead, he had already stepped on the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, I’m afraid I’m really going to fall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told the investigation team to prepare for tomorrow's trial, left the hotel alone and went to Doolin's manor on the sea cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Dudu told Du Lin Anpu to visit, Du Lin was a little surprised, but he still received the guy who chased his ass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the house, Amp took off his jacket, he looked at this luxurious place, couldn’t help but sneer Dulin, "Three million! Du Mr. Lin, you can make money faster than most people in the world. It is natural to live in such a house."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin Shrugging his shoulders, "I don't know what you are talking about, but there is one thing you are right about. I am making money very fast!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually At this time, whether it was Du Lin, Amp or Kevin, they knew that the outcome was already divided, so Du Lin avoided the problem of 30 million in Amp's mouth and indirectly admitted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin also came out of the hall, he and Amp greeted him and invited: "It’s almost noon, let’s eat together. "Dinner!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Anpu did not reject Kevin’s invitation, and soon they sat in the restaurant on the third floor and in the open air. The beef ribs in the baking tray are sizzling, and a good chef is borrowed from Alexander on a phone call, along with some fine ingredients. Dove poured the wine into the three and then retreated to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin picked up the glass and raised it, "What is the first cup?", he looked at Kevin, Kevin’s eyes turned and looked Amp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp suddenly laughed, and he also lifted the glass and raised it, "Fortune!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes!", Kevin followed up and raised the cup. "I like the thing you said. Everyone likes money, and me too." He added, "Grace wealth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three of the wine glasses touched it, took a sip, there was a chill in the cold spirits entrance, and soon turned into a fire to make the three people's body begin to heat. After dropping the glasses, Amp lowered his head and was somewhat decadent. "For a long time, I thought that law is the only truth in the world. I want to thank you, Mr. Doolin, you let me know that there is law. What is called money is closer to the truth than the law." He looked at Du Lin very sincerely. "You gave me a lesson, I thank you, really."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
