			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, my food is coming!", Jim looked at a guy with two hooks hanging two and a half meters long, the appearance of gold When the ribs with the hot butter came over, his saliva was secreted more vigorously. "I can't wait, damn you can't go faster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The man looks like he is only seventeen or eight years old, childish, and there is a circle of black fluff on his lips. He carefully walked over with two beef ribs and slowly walked over, the other one The hand is still holding by the ribs. When he placed the beef ribs on the plate in front of Jim, he was straight against him, which made Jim very unhappy, because he couldn't see more flesh, so he lifted it up. The short hand took a circle. "Are you new here? Turn around and lie in front of me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy has a face on his face The shy sly, immediately from Jim’s opposite side, went around him. The bodyguard who guarded the side let it go. He knew that the only thing that could be done at this time was to let Jim eat it well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has a temper for everyone. Jim is very good at speaking a lot, and can't find the shackles of the fierce nickname. You can even play a little more joke with him, even if he is the one who is joking, he will laugh a few words, but he will never be angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when you eat, you can't provoke him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood once said that Jim is like a dog that protects food. When you interfere with his eating, he will reveal his teeth, so Even Wood wouldn't bother him when he was eating, so he couldn't eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguard let go of a distance, the guy went to Jim's side and placed two beef ribs in front of him. The smile on Jim's face was as brilliant as the flowers in the summer, and even laughed. He didn't have a very vegan meal like a dining knife. He wasn't a decent person in front of the food, so he stretched out his hands and grabbed the bones on both ends of the ribs with his fingers slightly contracted by the hot beef. One bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the teeth cut into the beef, it also made a crispy sound. The beef had some chopped fruit peppers and some spices provided aroma mixed with butter. With beef, blast on his taste buds. He raised his head arbitrarily, and used the taste buds to feel the change of every taste. It was really delicious! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a young man on the side of the road was standing behind the bodyguard of Jim. He suddenly took off the scarf on the collar, jumped up and wrapped the neck of the bodyguard, and then used his knee to stare at his back. Laughter. Just as he did this, the little man was also launched in an instant. He stabbed the hook used to hook the beef ribs along Jim's chin, and another small hook was hooked on the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim’s sudden struggle was immediately struggling, but the hook made of steel was enough to hang a hundred pounds of meat, piercing his jaw and One of the ends was taut and buckled on the back of the chair. Don’t talk, he couldn’t even open his mouth, and the tongue was pierced together. In addition to making a meaningless hum, he only I can wave my arms indiscriminately and struggle with struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he realized the importance of losing weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy turned around and stood behind Jim. He ignored Jim’s roundness and looked at his fierce eyes. He reached for the table and didn’t The used knife smashed into Jim's neck and stabbed it in. The blood spurted out at a moment, and the hot blood sizzled on the plate and brought more flavor changes to the barbecue beef ribs. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even stabbed a few knives, and the last slash in Jim’s chest, after being stabbed a few times in a row, Jim’s struggle suddenly increased for a moment, eventually Slowly weaken. The guy pulled out the knife and turned into the chest of Jim's bodyguard. After connecting two knives, he quickly left with another boy. It was not until this time that someone had recovered from the great changes and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire process of murder has gone from the outbreak to the end, and it took up to ten seconds. It’s so fast that many people don’t know what happened, the two guys Ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the boss who was guiding his son’s roast beef ribs in the back hall ran out with an apron, when he saw Jim’s hands were pulled on both sides. At the time, there was a blackout in front of him, and his legs were weak and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End, Jim died here, Wood will revenge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss, but the people who came from that era, know that these people are far from the glamorous on their surface, and think of the results they might face, he The whole person seems to have lost his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another street, a group of people gathered together. These people were all looking at the eyeliner of Wood. They were responsible for collecting Doolin’s news, but until now they only know the name of Doolin, and his appearance and age. Although this information has been repeated and repeated, Wood does not care, but instead gives Gigi the money according to the good price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since becoming a gentleman, active whitewashing wants to enter the upper class, he has already lost a lot of things. Now, he regrets, so he needs to spend more money to be able to buy the lost things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this incident, he did not want to change back to the gentleman. Perhaps he is best suited to be a mob, a villain, not a clothing animal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My...", a thin guy just wants to reach out and take the money that belongs to him from Jiji’s hand, Jiji’s The hand shrank, so he couldn't help but scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These long-term street guys are actually very cheap, as long as five dollars can buy some news from their mouth. Wood gave a higher price, ten dollars a message, and didn't mind spam, which made all the tramps and the prodigals on the streets crazy. Looking at the stack of at least 50 yuan in the hands of Jiji, this thin guy's muscles on his face leaped and his eyes became dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these people, Gigi is not afraid of it, even if they add together, they dare not do anything to him. Everyone knows that Gigi is Wood's bodyguard, and moving Gigi is equal to challenging Wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disregarding the threat in his eyes, Gigi looked at him. "It’s okay to want money, but if this is the next spam, don’t count on it. I took away even a penny from me, did you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin guy snorted and the fierce face on his face immediately faded and changed into clothes. The charming look, nodded and said: "Understood, understand, the next time is absolutely useful news, or no charge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jiji is satisfied The hand reached out and spread out. The thin guy immediately took the money from his hand and went to the crowd two times and then sat in his pocket with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd gradually spread, these people will work harder to collect information for the money, just when Gigi is ready to leave, a man in a windbreaker The young man in the cap came over. He looked at him more because the young man was very handsome and very sunny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
