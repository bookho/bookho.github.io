			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s team was stopped by a team of military vehicles when they first entered the western state of Cacots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack has been going on for two weeks now, and the military’s people still have not found any clues. The group of attackers disappeared after leaving the city. In the wilderness of the west, this is the reason why the western folk customs are simple. No matter what you do, as long as no one sees what you look like, when you are done in the wild after doing a good or bad thing, you are hiding or swaying and going back, you will not leave too many clues. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The western wind will make the traces on the Gobi disappear quickly, once again merged with nature, and lack of clues, it seems that this case I have hit the ceiling and can't find any way out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin, who suddenly left the West and returned, became one of the directions for the National Security and Safety Commission to solve the case, whether or not this is done by Du Lin, now They all have to do something to prove that they are actually solving the case in the west, not like a headless fly. In fact, they even hope that Du Lin will not come back after leaving, at least this will let them tell the Ministry of Defense that Du Lin is the most suspect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, hello, I am a senior adviser to the National Security and Safety Commission. This is my ID. You can go to the Ministry of Defense or the Western Army Military Region. Check the authenticity of the documents and check my personal information." A young officer in his early thirties stood on the side of the car where Du Lin was sitting. Du Lin, who was sitting behind the window, handed himself out. Documents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the young officer, or a senior adviser. He did not wear the casual clothes like the senior agents of the investigation bureau, but wore military uniforms. Everyone on the surrounding military vehicles is wearing military uniforms, but this does not mean that these people are real officers. In this era of underdeveloped information exchange, there is no such thing as impersonating the imperial staff. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of a new era, there was a group of people who spoke of military and senior empire’s identity in the West to talk about investment, from several local city halls in the west. Rolling away millions of investment and bank loans, and finally disappeared. Even today, this case has not been cracked, becoming the most dazzling of many fraud cases, because these people opened the door to a new world for everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer's expression is very serious, and the face does not look like a bad person, but the face of this most deceptive thing will never give back to one's true inner world. He flipped the document in his hand and couldn't see how true or false it was. He then handed it to Ikot, who is also the president of the city's fellowship. "Check it out." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icote immediately opened the door and took the documents and walked to the telephone booth on the side of the road and got in, picked up the phone and dialed the phone of the Ministry of Defense. The officer was on the phone. This made the officer's face slightly change, because every time he presented the certificate, those people would always trust the document with great trust and believed everything he said. No one has ever tried to verify what he said and his identity like Du Lin, which made him feel a little bit of emotion, just like he was being used as a liar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Dulin’s actions did not have any oversteps, and he still offered to verify his identity, so he could only stand in the same place. After waiting for about three or four minutes, Icott came out of the telephone booth, handed the documents to Doolin, and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin only paid attention to the documents at this time, he jumped his eyebrows, "Adam, senior adviser of the Security Committee... oh oh, three The 12-year-old colonel, you are very amazing." Du Lin handed the documents out of the window and used his smiling face to face the soldier named Adam. "True!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that this compliment makes Adam’s mood a little better, or that Du Lin just scratched his favorite place, and he inserted the document into his jacket’s pocket. I nodded and said a thank you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are we looking for a place or a military district?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam did not hesitate, immediately Answer: "We go to the state government!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of people entering the state government’s parking lot soon after the military vehicle’s inauguration, the Imperial National Security and Security Council Referred to as the Security Committee, the state government temporarily borrowed a floor as a temporary base for this case. The state government is quite vocal about this. It is believed that the people of the Security Committee should go to the military region instead of borrowing the venue of the state government. This makes people feel that the Security Council has some problems with the state government. After all, the empire’s management system is in the state government. The vertical management of the empire is not fully accepted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the people of the Security Committee will not discuss so many things with the people of the state government. Their task is to handle the case, not to talk about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was invited by Adam to a small meeting room on the fourth floor. During the road, Doolin saw a familiar back. He seemed to be Someone who saw the person wearing a casual dress and carrying a walking stick could not remember it for a while. When he was ready to look at it a little more, that person had disappeared into the hallway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be too sensitive, and Du Lin thought of this little episode as an accident. After all, Kevin’s image of a walking stick has already entered his mind. So, when I saw someone who was also holding a cane and didn't want to show that he was a blind man, he would subconsciously think that this is a familiar person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doolin sat in the room ready for investigations and inquiries, in another room, Amp sat behind a glass wall and chewed Beef jerky, while watching Du Lin on the other side of the glass wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His feeling is still so keen, I just turned my back to him, he noticed me.", Amp smiled and said the officer around him A few words, this time his task was to be seconded by the Security Committee for a period of time to fully investigate the attack, whether the cabinet or the Ministry of Defense paid special attention to this matter. Some people think that it is possible that this is the behavior of some extreme reorganization organizations, so they will agree to seconded Amp to see if they can find the scum of the scum from this case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer next to him ignored his words, Amp shrugged his shoulders, pressed a button on the front of the table, and the two tapes slowly rotated. He whispered that he could start, and Adam, who was standing in the hallway, immediately pushed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I have been waiting for you, I handed over the procedure.", Adam’s face was soft and his face was hung on his ear. The radio's earpiece, the sound in the earpiece tells him that he must have some doubts about Doolin, but he can't be too tough, otherwise Doolin will soon try to master the initiative and drive the rhythm. Amp is familiar with Doolin. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. He sat in a chair in a very relaxed and relaxed way, and still tilted his legs. He slightly put the coffee on the table. Up and down, "No need to be too polite, the coffee here is good, and as an imperial citizen, I have an obligation to cooperate with the military to seize the criminals who raised arms to the innocent citizens." He said that he also smiled deliberately. Then, when I almost said that Adam would stand up, "Right, is there still a group of people sitting behind this glass? If you don't mind, they can come and sit down, let's discuss it together."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the glass, Amp couldn’t help but laugh. He pointed to Du Lin’s smile on the ugly officer. “This is as annoying as before!” In fact, Amp’s heart is very exciting at the moment. There is a kind of happiness that can't be said, like a long-time good friend suddenly meets, there are countless words to say, and contains a kind of joy to see the same kind of people. He has to start his favorite game again, but this time, there will be no more off-site factors that interfere with his judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed the button of the communication and said to the microphone: "Stabilize, he is using words to test your emotions, but you have not escaped this. A temptation, without denial and no confirmation, directly start the following question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any licked his mouth, his face was gone, and he was replaced by seriousness The expression, this Du Lin is more difficult than he imagined. In the first sentence of the opening, I gave myself a "hold", which made him feel a little lost face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, in the morning of February 21, the morning of February 21, an armed attack occurred in the state. A group of militants During a parade, the crowd shot and caused very serious consequences. Do you know this?” Adam’s eyes were always staring at Doolin, and Du Lin nodded after taking a sip of coffee, and he Asked: "Someone rumors that you may be involved in this case, and may even be the messenger. Do you have anything to say about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du After Lin Biao’s head was over, he put his cocked legs down. He sat in a correct posture and was facing Adam. His expression became awe-inspiring. “Cathed by Adam, I have heard some unreliable rumors. "I don't know if you are interested?" Adam also nodded. Du Lin immediately spoke up without giving him the opportunity to hesitate. He knew that someone behind the glass wall was remotely controlling the inquiry. "I heard that it was the royal family. I don’t know if it’s true or not, maybe it’s true?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam’s eyebrows suddenly stood up, it’s just a mess! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pity that he hasn’t had an attack yet, but Du Lin has taken the lead to say his inner reaction. “But I think this is nonsense, we all know Any behavior is purposeful. Some people say that it is made by the royal family. So what is the motivation? What is the purpose? Why should the royal family create such an attack? What kind of results do they want to achieve?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Similarly, I also passed these questions on to my personal body. You said that I may be involved in the case. Very good. I want to ask the same question. What is the motivation for doing this? What is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
