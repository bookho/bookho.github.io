			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman who just returned to his villa and took off his coat and hung it on the hanger. This villa has only one butler and two besides him. Maid. The doorman has no wife, but he has several lovers, and maybe even more. After all, in the turbulent years, no one knows where the doorman went, nor does he know if this guy is outside. Control the things in your pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to common sense, he can’t control it. It is said that he has many illegitimate children, and people have long been numb. At the beginning, some people were concerned about this matter, but soon they found that the doormen themselves did not care about the illegitimate children who were born in the overnight relationship, and their concern was superfluous. Even many people secretly rejoice that the doorman has no wife and no formal children. In the future, he is so old that he will die, and power will not be passed on to his next generation. This is a good thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some tired prospects look like they are about sixty years old. He has two white spots and brown hair is a bit gray, which is characteristic of aging. His maintenance in the past few years is not bad. He doesn't look old like an ordinary old man. But when he is older, he is older. Some things can be dissatisfied. Even in the face of time, even the gods must bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler has already greeted him. This is an old man who looks like a very old man. He is tall, a little slim, wearing a dress. "Mr., you are back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer nodded and walked toward the house, the housekeeper followed him, and the two entered the study. After closing the door, the doorman sat in a chair and took a sigh of relief. He looked up at the housekeeper. "How is the investigation going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steward’s grim face squeezed out a blunt smile, as if he was a man I don’t laugh, "Mr., things have gotten a bit of a look. We followed the girl to Irian. She met a young man named Doolin. According to our survey, this young man named Doolin. I used to stay in Tener for a while. He was a private drinker there. Later he was imprisoned for four months for some small things. After the gold robbery, he disappeared. It happened again in Irian."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman thoughtfully asked: "Do you mean that the gold may be in the hands of this called Doolin?"<br /><br />&nbsp As the leader of the Kadima Party, the party has the greatest power and one of the most prestigious people. The farmers are very clear that they will almost lose to the old parties. If it is not used at the crucial moment to suppress the 30 million yuan of the KMT’s gold, it will suddenly be robbed. Maybe they will be picked up after a brief surface. He wants to thank the group of robbers who have robbed 30 million gold bricks, but at the same time he also looked at the 30 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these 30 million, he will be more confident in the state's dominance in the mid-term elections after half a year. Once he masters the state, he can exert his ambition and step by step to the highest power of the empire. Powerfully slow down. He used to think that those who went to death for the sake of ideals were fools, even though he still thinks that those people are fools, but he can also do such things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not for a great ideal, he is for power, and money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a businessman, no matter what kind of skin is used to cover up his essence, he can't change the things in his bones. He is a businessman. He is very grateful to those who include Mr. Zema, who turned him from a Hummer to a big man this year, and he is also very grateful that he can stick to this step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to supreme power and ideals, he must make 120,000 points of effort, the most indispensable of which is money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sent people to Tern to collect clues, the robbers were very clean and couldn’t find much useful information, so he had to stare at him. The only witness in this case who might know the robbers, namely Alisa. Eight months of close surveillance almost gave up the doorman. If he didn't need the 30 million too much, he might have already withdrawn. Fortunately, when he almost lost patience, the people who monitored Alisa discovered anomalies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went to Irian and met a young man named Du Lin who also appeared in Turner last year. If this is just an ordinary young person, perhaps those supervisors will give up after a period of attention, but this private wine dealer named Doolin actually owns a villa worth 350,000 and is also cooperating with a family. The jewelry store, this news suddenly cheered everyone up, they thought they found the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This message was sent to the Mennon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housekeeper’s discretion and less certain tone replied: “There is no evidence that the young man named Doolin is a participant in the Golden Robbery. However, the following people think that he is very likely to be the target we are looking for, so we are still paying close attention and monitoring. This person has some power and is very prestigious in the local area. Our people are not very close, only far away. Look far away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mennon nodded. "The next six months is a crucial half for our Kadima Party. As long as we can make a positive impact, they will not vote for us in the mid-term election. People are staring at this. Guy, if you can be sure that he is, arrange for people to do it directly. Remember, we don't care about the life and death of a small person, but the money in his hand must be found!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was in a short silence, and the doorman closed his eyes and motioned as if he was asleep. After a while, he opened his eyes. When he came back, the kind of red light and positive momentum had disappeared without a trace, leaving only deep, and Senran. He supported his chin in one hand and played a delicate lighter in one hand. His eyes were locked on the lighter, but he was thinking about other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shapk is too old, thinking about retreating, and even more hateful is that he is still holding a group of people standing on his side. Miss this In the second-term general election, we have to wait for four years. After four years, no one can tell what kind of world it is, we can't wait that long. After a long time, people's boiling blood will cool down. He is too troublesome. Arrange a person to talk to him and convince him!", said the doorman laughed, and there was a hint of indifference in the laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few decades of feelings are vulnerable to power and desire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shapuq is the party whip in the Kadima Party, the third person, the original idea of ​​the doorman is to put this stubborn old man in this position Benefits outweigh the disadvantages But in fact he made a mistake. For him, power is very important. Money is very important. Everything is important. He is not the old "revolutionary party." He can't understand their "ideal is above everything else." spirit. The Shapk guy is the kind of person. He sees his ideals more than anything else. He even quarreled with Mennon several times during this time, so that the doormen could not get off the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​the doorman is to move the federal welfare system directly as soon as possible, first to capture the voters' intentions, and then adjust the internal structure and other things step by step. But Shapke thinks that the federal package is good, but it may be unacceptable on the empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He really wants to create a "new world," but the price should not be a crumbling foundation. It has become a normality for citizens of the federal side to pay various fees, but people on the empire have never paid anything other than taxes. It is really necessary for them to pay a pension and medical insurance for their old age on time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
