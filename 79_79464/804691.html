			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp doesn’t know why he wants to laugh, he squints his eyes and raises his eyebrows and smiles and shakes his head. "Sorry, Clark, our opponents are more than we imagined." To be smart, this road won't work!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is something else, Amp can't say it, Clark will definitely agree with his ideas and suggestions, but this time. Different. Clark himself is doing finance. He is very clear about the laws of the bank. The "funding" is enough to prove that Du Lin and Luke are related, and Luke is one of the suspects in this case. Lin is obliged to accept the summons, which is the obligation given to him by the law and the power of the investigation team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp did not wait for Clark to say anything, he raised his hand and stopped him. "I know that you want to use 'financial exchanges' to prove that there is a clear relationship between the two. The relationship exists, but do you know? I started thinking about using this method to summon Du Lin on the day I saw Luke five days ago, but I went to the bank to check it and found that it could not be done at all. It is also one of the reasons why I think Doolin has some suspicions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to Luke, his six million cash should be transferred to Doolin Then he partnered with Doolin to become a shareholder of Orient Star Entertainment. However, he later did not know why Du Lin canceled the idea, changed him to set up the company, and turned himself into a shareholder. My initial opinion was that these six hundred Wan seems to have returned to Luke's account in a round of Doolin's account. In fact, he has operated in the process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But this is not the case!", Amp pinched his finger joints, and there was a kind of flash in his eyes. Full of interest, "Luke's money and Doolin have no relationship on the books. The money goes directly to an anonymous fund account, and then there are six million accounts in this account that go into DreamWorks' public account. Medium, which is the fund in the announcement at the second suspension."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then this anonymous fund account gave Luke another six million in Luke. It seems that the money entered Du Lin’s account and then returned to his account because of company problems, but in fact all of this has no penny relationship with Doolin. DreamWorks’ money returns to this anonymous fund account. It was then diverted to hundreds of accounts and then flowed to an anonymous fund account of the Commonwealth Bank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for where the money is now, we I don't know, with the feedback from the Federal Bank, the money has been constantly hedging through thousands of accounts, and finally disappeared through consumption and cash withdrawal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Clark slightly opened his mouth and his eyes were a little godless. He only woke up for a long time, and then he asked: "This can fully explain that Doolin has something to do with this. We can apply to summon him."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp shook his head again, which made Clark a little angry. He frowned and asked, "Why is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Amp took the pen unconsciously drawing something on the paper, while drawing and wondering for Clark. "The first point, Luke and Juan both admitted in the confession that they had only contradictions with Doolin, and went further. It is said that they betrayed Doolin in business conduct and drove him out of his business. They did not have legal effect on Doolin’s testimony unless there were other people unrelated to them who could prove that Du Lin had given Lu The account is required, and Luke is required to transfer the money. Only then can I prove that Doolin may have something to do with this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second point, reasoning and Guessing does not have legal significance, and judges cannot guess by our reasoning. And the emotional judgment that Du Lin is involved in this matter, especially Du Lin is a big rich, the judge will be more careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third point ..., in the absence of other people's cards and physical evidence, Du Lin just said that this is a trap and a shackle, we not only have no way to take him, maybe even training."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And this is Du Lin's cleverness. He has no direct or indirect contact with all lines of evidence. Only Luke and his assistant were in Du Lin's account with Luke. His The assistant doesn't know the bank's account number, and he doesn't have the power to testify for Luke. This means that Du Lin can't get rid of it as long as he doesn't know anything."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If he is really a participant in this case, he will secretly do something that we don't know to alleviate her suspicion. In the end we have nothing to gain. He is launching a public opinion offensive that is enough for us. The big men above have lost confidence and patience to us. They will be there. Hodock, you will lose your job, and I will carry the first stain in history, so we will not deal with him for the time being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let He feels that he still has mastered all of this. When we find enough clues, we take him directly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp puts down the pen in his hand, a big one The head of the orangutan jumped on the paper, Clarke left with a black face, and Amp smiled and packed up the good things. He felt that he should see Du Lin, go alone, and go quietly. He is very interested in Doolin. With his many years of experience in solving crimes, Du Lin is very likely to be the main involved person. Such a clever "bad guy" is very rare. He wants to meet Du Lin, face to face. Seeing what kind of guy this guy is, maybe you can find some other clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the case arrived here, it was deadlocked, and the customs had provided clues. Joshua left the empire and went to the federation. They asked the federal for assistance, but the news came back that Joshua died of "falling." His head hit the bathtub and then lost consciousness in the bathtub and was drowned alive. And there are also the manufacturers of the bathtub to the court, it is said that it has extended other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Joshua’s men couldn’t ask for anything useful, they only knew that they were operating a very promising stock that kept coming up. Capital inflows and a growing number of public accounts give them confidence. Even two of them were caught at the police station because Joshua did not appear for a long time, which made them think that the boss had an accident, so they went to the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group has not heard of any information about the investors behind them. They don’t even know about Hood, but they need to be responsible for this fraud. And this is one of the "cakes" left by the mastermind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;瞧, the mastermind is Hoodock and Joshua, the threat is that these young people or middle-aged people, a complete team, enough to shut up society and public opinion, So let them sing hymns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for where the money went, that is another question, and one day I can catch it back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp’s whimsy, if Doolin is related to all of this, perhaps his bank’s flow of funds will have some omen. Through these signs, you may find new clues. He thought that he immediately put things in his briefcase and then went to the Imperial Central Bank across the road with the protection of two soldiers. In the bank, he asked for all accounts related to Dooling. In the end, he was surprised to find that Du Lin actually had only one account, and the account was very healthy and could not see any problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every month, a profit is remitted to this account on time, and other amounts will disappear. It has not changed since half a year ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you see the account information of these funds?" In a desperate way, Amp thought of a stupid way, but stupid way is a stupid way, all There are no abnormalities in the flow of funds. What makes him feel the most headache is that this account was created only half a year ago. It seems that Du Lin did not have it half a year ago...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he thought of, the whole person was madly walking around the circle under the strange eyes of the staff, and his mouth uttered some vocabulary and sound that people could not understand. After a moment, his movement suddenly stopped. There is a flash of light in the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ran back to the staff body with excitement, and his eyes showed a sultry luster. "Check it out and find out when the jewelry company’s account was "!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff has several colleagues in the endurance, there is no information office at this time, all the information is recorded on the paper, they are The individual ran into the archives like a warehouse. After looking for a while, he found out a portfolio. "The date the jewelry company created the public account... the day before the creation date of the Doolin account!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp punched the table and the whole person was excited. "Yes, yes, that's it. Check out the other shareholders of this jewelry company." Account information, trouble you.", he also knows that this is actually very difficult, but at this time he has caught a glimpse. He took a box of cigarettes from his pocket and stuffed twenty dollars into the pocket of the bank worker and helped him pat the dust on his elbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some unhappy staff members who had a lot of good attitudes and smiles on their faces. Soon they found what Amp wanted. come out. Amp was so eager to open these things one by one, and soon the excitement on his face gradually disappeared. This jewelry store has two shareholders, except Doolin, which have the longest life. One has existed for eleven years, and the shortest has more than three years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of these accounts is normal, there is nothing wrong with it, which makes Amp fall into an inextricable cycle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a vague speculation that Du Lin is very likely to be one of the protagonists of the Teel Gold robbery, but the problem is that he still has no The evidence can prove this. He can actually say this and the imperialist central bank, with the strength of the imperial central bank enough for Du Lin to accept their inspections and inquiries, paying attention to inspections and inquiries, not search and interrogation. Once the imperial central bank can't find evidence to throw Du Lin into jail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately it will be him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy...! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
