			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Irrigation?", Du Lin reached out and took a look at the owed in their mouths from these people. It did not differ from the ordinary owed. There are some hard legal restrictions, and finally the amount they borrowed from Doolin and the interest they need to pay when they are repaid, which is a bit higher than the bank’s interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are very qualified owings, there is no trace of fault, even the date is not these days, there are their signatures and related lawyers Signature. In short, these people can be said to be painstaking in order to return Du Lin’s money. They not only came up with a very suitable reason, but also made relevant materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin threw the owed back to the table, and he licked his lips, revealing a smile. "These owments are problematic."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a problem? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see me, I see you, this is one of the ways that one of them came up with, and returned the money to Doolin in the name of repayment. As a result, the money they defrauded from Doolin returned to Doolin’s pocket, which was a compensation for the previously unpleasant transaction. Secondly, I also took care of my face. If I really only gave Du Lin's money to Du Lin, I would sit down on their business irregularities and integrity issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this contract-oriented society, you can do a lot of bad things, whether it’s exploiting workers or borrowing money from a bank, but you can’t do it, It is against the contractual spirit between merchants and businessmen, using contract fraud. Any contract fraud will be regarded as a very serious act of dishonesty. This is more serious for any business than any punishment, because it will be considered when others cooperate with you. Is this transaction a scam? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The untrustworthy businessmen are not necessarily miserable, but they may not be able to do it again, so they found an excuse for themselves. The behavior has been patched to take care of both sides, and Du Lin should be happy to let them go. To know that after doing this, Du Lin did not encounter fraud. Being deceived is actually an incompetent performance. This method almost completely solved the problems of both sides, but why is Du Lin still not satisfied? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other three mine owners who borrowed the "repayment" method looked at the bald friend and seemed to be letting him negotiate with Du Lin. His scalp was a bit numb, and he could only ask for courage and whispered: "Mr. Doolin, you think there is something wrong with it, we can still modify it now." This is a bit of a confession. He uses " "Modify", not "consultation" or "negotiation", there is still a bit of a position, he has already recognized it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pointed to those who owe the debt and said: "The money is wrong!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Money...not right?", the bald head stunned and then quickly explained, " This is the sum of the money we borrowed from you and the interest generated by these debts these days..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin leaned back on the back of the sofa, he sucked A cigarette, slowly spit out, "I don't mean interest, I mean the principal." He pointed the four people sitting across from the finger with a cigarette. "You four took six from me." Millions, even the profit should be 7.2 million. I am in a good mood today, 200,000 yuan is not needed, four people, a total of seven million, you discuss how to pay me.", said he stood "I am going out to exercise, I hope that when I come back, you have already negotiated a result." He said that he annihilated the cigarette butts in the ashtray. "So, see you later!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Du Lin’s back on the sneakers, these four guys are on their backs. Sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They got a total of less than 3.6 million from Du Lin’s hands, but Du Lin said that they took six million, even the one is Seven hundred and twenty-two thousand, this means that if they want to fill this pit, they must not only spit out Du Lin’s money, but also make up another one. The punishment is too heavy. They all looked serious and looked like they had forgotten how bright their faces were when they took the bank draft from Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is very long and short-lived. There are countless forks in the journey of life. How to choose and which way to go is your choice. The road to life cannot be turned back. No matter whether it is a storm or a landslide, it is your choice. Even if you bite your teeth, you have to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do now?", a man in his forties who is outstanding in appearance, with a resentful color, he lied Du Lin seven hundred and fifty thousand. He will pay at least 1.5 million at the current rate. When I sold the waste mine to Doolin, it was purely a matter of holding a little more, and this time he had to pay a total of 850,000 principal and interest and an extra 100,000 interest. He felt that this was enough, and he could show his sincerity. He didn't expect Du Lin's heart to be darker and his appetite bigger, which made him a bit too much to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that he can’t get another seventy-five thousand, he can get it, but he’s not willing. It is not fair to punish him in such a way that he has made a small mistake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bald head smiled and took the coffee table on his own owe. His money is the second most, a whole million. If he wants to satisfy Du Lin, he will take out another one million. He does not It will really erase the 200,000 heads that Du Lin said to be the truth. To do something wrong, it is definitely a price to pay, although this generation is heavy outside the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and immediately took out a pen to add one under the owed clause, even with a profit of two million, paid to Doolin at the prescribed time. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other three people watched his actions feel that he was crazy, this is a million wealth, and they can make money in about two years to earn Come back - the real big mine owners like Hendry have already gone to see God, and the rest is that they are cheaper behind Hendry. More or less want to subsidize your own losses by paying money from Doolin's pocket, or get a little more money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bally looking at his own owe, his face began to turn white, his body is an unreasonable astronomical figure in the eyes of ordinary people, but put his When you are in such a situation, you don’t have to be thick. After paying Du Lin’s arrears, his liquidity was almost completely exhausted, and even the cash in the bank could not be paid, only through the price of real estate or jewelry. Did he do this because he is a qualified businessman? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, obviously not, the reason that really motivated him to do this is that he is afraid of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is really afraid of death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hengdeli is a well-known figure in the West Mine, with four mining areas under his hand, earning more than one million each year, but that how about it? Still not saying that death is dead? If Hendry came back from heaven and asked if he would like to pay a million to Du Lin for his own survival, he believes that not to mention one million, three million Hendry are willing to give. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life only once, don’t make fun of your life, this is the instruction his father told him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bald head down and squinting at the face of a bankruptcy look makes the other three are dumb, some have made a choice, and some are still watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about half an hour, Du Lin came back from the outside, he ran outside for a while, and recently stayed in the hospital bed to make him feel his body It's a bit rusty, it's time to exercise. He gave the four mine owners a very polite smile, and took a shower on the second floor. After changing clothes, he sat back on the other side of the coffee table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gentlemen, do you want to be clear?" He looks very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bald guy nodded and gave his owe to Doolin. "Mr. Doolin, you are right, I remember, I am indeed I borrowed 1.8 million from you, and even brought two million yuan. This is a loan." He said that he stopped for a while, and Du Lin took the affair and looked at it for a while before he continued. Now, in some cases in the west, you know that many things are accumulated in your hands and cannot be sold. I mean that cash may not be enough. Can you use some other things to offset the price?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has no reason to refuse. "This is all right. If we get along for a long time, you will find that I am a very good person. What kind of price do you want to use? Mining rights? Ore? Metal ingots Or is it real estate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the metal ingot?", the bald face suddenly showed a smile, and he sighed, "If you can." I have aluminum ingots and copper ingots worth about half a million here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, you can pay me another cash. If there is mining that can be mined to me, I don't mind what these things are, as long as they are worth the price." Lin said that he looked at the other three people. "Do you think about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people are in silence, but soon there is a guy I took up my own owe fiercely, added a clause on it like a bald head, then looked up at Du Lin and asked, "Mr. Doolin, you just said 200,000 of the 7.2 million wipes. It’s gone, is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also stumbled. “Yes, I will not deny what I said, I said so.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy suddenly smiled. "Then you, I borrowed you one hundred and six hundred thousand, according to our agreement, you need to pay you one hundred and sixty. Million, but you erased 200,000, I only need to pay you one hundred and forty thousand, right?"<br /><b r />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely a profiteer. His cleverness is that he found that the bald guy did not remove Duan’s 200,000 a quarter from his account. The other two guys apparently have not made the final decision. In such a gap, he found a way to save himself a little. This is enough to pay more than 500,000 more than his planned plan. Although it hurts, it has not been made yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
