			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fact that is well known to everyone, and no one can cover up the facts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the death of the doorman has the greatest impact on who, then it must be the Kadima Party. The only one who can get a countertop in the entire Kadima Party is the Mennon. He became the only influential person in the Kadima party with his own set of "politics and trading". As for others, it is not very mixed. Most of these people are slaves, free people, and descendants of civilians. They are able to become the confidants of the doormen and become the backbone of the Kadima Party, not from their ability, but from loyalty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are loyal to the doormen, so the doormen have placed these people in important positions in various cities by virtue of the principle of “useful energy is better than cooked”. The farmer’s plan is very simple. He becomes the governor, and then among his men, the outstanding ones will gradually become the mayors of the cities and finally occupy the west. As long as he is occupied by the three western states, he can naturally bring him many different kinds of interests. Apart from things like wealth, power, status and prestige, there is one of the most important things, that is, talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mennon and Dooling, as well as all small and medium-sized forces from non-aristocratic, face an unselectable difficulty, that is, lack of talent and lack of top talent. These things are not bought by money. The top talents themselves have great social value. They can find a financial group to bring huge economic returns and social status, and they are joined by a group of mud dog legs. People laughed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give them more money, they can't change their satisfaction and sincerity. These top talents are often more realistic than those with half a bottle of water. Because the knowledge and abilities they have acquired are enough for them to see through the false surface of the whole society and enable them to see the essence of society through the surface. On the contrary, those who have half a bottle of water often hold some idealistic attitudes and think that they can change what they can rely on their own abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A force that wants to have better development is difficult to go without the support of a large number of high-level talents and top talents. The simplest example is to govern the city. We all say that it is not very simple to manage cities, attract investment, resolve conflicts, improve happiness, improve jobs, accelerate urban development, and adjust social structural classes in a timely manner. A few simple words can sum up what a city manager needs to do, but the problem is that knowing it doesn't necessarily mean doing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without these talents, even if the door farmers occupy the actual power of the three western states, he will not last long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is a solution in itself, and that is the identity of the doorman. Once he became the governor, it means that he is no longer a "grassroots". The governor’s intention to say this during the aristocratic period is also the status of a governor, and there are still some gaps with the lords and barons who have fortunately become nobles. Based on the status of the governor, it can incite some senior talents to recognize the Kadima Party. With the joining of these people, and with these people as the "bone" of the Kadima Party, and the other people as "meat", the Kadima Party can usher in a huge leap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the reasons why Mennon clearly holds the information of Mr. Kesma’s family but is unwilling to take it out, except for the fear of this family. He is still worried about his future. If the new party "hopes" that he is unsuccessful in the election, he is very likely to lose. Don't say anything fair and open. The final vote will be sent to the Imperial Capital for auditing. Is it difficult to do it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not difficult at all. It’s a bad three or five votes. It’s a pity that public opinion is a big pity. I encourage the doormen to come again after eight years... This is the next day. political. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the doorman needs to master a heavyweight chip, which can play a role in the election year, and there is no information about Mr. Bixma’s family. More powerful chips - apart from this, he really does not have anything to trade with the cabinet, this is his only hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result, he is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of the doorman is not a big problem, even Magus does not feel the crisis that a western mayor will die for the whole society. What really felt trouble was the Kadima Party and the members of the Kadima Party left after the death of the Mennon. When the doormen are not dead, whether they are the city halls of the localities or the state governments of the three western states, treating them is like treating their brothers, making them feel that they have integrated into the circles of the upper class in the west and become real. A member of the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of this feeling that these people and the doormen have betrayed the beliefs of the past, but now the problem is coming, the feeling of comfort is gone. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they are feeling now is from the surrounding colleagues and the indifference of the superiors and even malicious treatment. In the past, some small things were not done well, and the colleagues would help them. They have to pass and let them pass. Now, a little thing is not done well, and our indifference with a smirk makes them feel serious emotional damage, and the superior's strictness on them makes them feel their own... stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this happened after the death of the Mennon, and on the fifth day after the death of the Kadima, the organization meeting was held to discuss what to do next. But no one knows what to do. In the past, these things were all done by the farmers, they didn't need to think, they didn't need to worry, just do things well according to the requirements of the farmers. Suddenly, a wolf was lost and the wild wolves became a dirt dog. Nothing would be anything except the barking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only at this time, the people of the Kadima Party know how important the doormen are to the Kadima Party. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And regardless of the Kadima party that has become a mess of wheat, the death of the doormen has also boiled up the working class who bought the three guarantee policies in the west, presided over this The policy people go to see God, then what to do with his policies, how to continue to implement, how to continue to implement has become a big problem. At the same time, the reorganized workers' union finally found their importance in tears. The Western working class strongly urged the workers' unions to represent them and negotiate with the state governments of the three states to ensure that their interests were not harmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this kind of thing, the state government is impossible to promise. The doorman used the light or dark means to indirectly corrupt the state government. Now that he is dead, who cares about him and his dog legs? The tough attitude of the state government has created a series of troubles, the most intuitive is the strike! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the organization of the working class through the strikes and marches to coerce the government and the capitalists to compromise has always been the best means of workers' unions, no one, swept the three continents The wave of strikes in 22 cities reached their climax in an instant. The entire empire is concerned about the strikes in the western region, including the cabinets are paying attention to the strikes in the west. People all know that the economic retrogressive effects of strikes have a negative impact on society. Why should the state government maintain a tough attitude? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is very simple. The three governors plan to settle accounts in the fall. If there is no strong social unrest, how to remove the people of the Kadima from the state government and the city hall? ? It was very easy for the Mennon to die. He had a dozen shots lying on the ground, and the two feet ended. But how did he solve the mess left, how to deal with the personnel problems he left behind, and how the social conflicts caused Mediation? These are very complicated things, but there is a way to make complex things less complicated, that is, to find individuals or forces to come back to the black pot, and then kill them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The culprits are dead, what other contradictions can't be solved? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
