			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter, but also after Graf left Dulin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Graf clearly felt that he was excluded from Doolin’s small circle. He also hated Du Lin, cursed him, and even wanted Prove that you are not the kind of person they think. But time proved that Du Lin and Dudu's choice was not wrong. Graf finally admitted that he was not the one who did the work for Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no clever brain, no awareness of vigilance, no strong execution, and no way to defend one side. The only thing he can do is to brag and bet with Du Lin, and drink some wine to play with a woman. He is not this material. So he recognized, he gradually did not blame Du Lin, and did not blame the Buddha, it really blames him. If it weren't for his mother and brother who insisted on leaving to save his own, he might not have to die so many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not that he doesn’t believe in Doolin’s judgment, maybe there’s not a lot of things behind, so he realizes that he can’t help Du Lin. What is busy, can only drag down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to Orodo with his mother and brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bonus that Du Lin gives him every month. His life is very happy. At first, he did have some time to feel that the money would be stabbed. It hurts his heart. He thinks this is the charity that Du Lin gave him. But as he gradually reversed his mentality, he accepted the money frankly. It is a recollection of the past, at least Dooling did not forget him, and there was no accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Doolin gradually left his life completely, his life became simpler and purer. I bought a big house, and I have more money to let my mother enjoy a better life, so that my brother can enjoy a more secure and stable school. He has nothing to satisfy. Even he found a girlfriend, a woman who met at the bar... oh... child, not short of him, and his body is very strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can spend a lifetime on this day, it’s actually good. Until a month ago, he found that his brother frequently took money from the bank. He I noticed this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf’s younger brother and he are not like a mother, Graf’s five big three are tall and strong, his brother is not very tall, and very Thin and still wearing a pair of glasses. He has a nickname in the University of Ordos called the worm. Personality is a little inferior, the most amazing thing is that this guy actually has a girlfriend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf knew that the woman named Kelly was not a good thing. She was with her brother because her brother had money, but he didn't care. In Graff's simple brain circuit, when his younger brother and daughter voted for a long-term female prosperous, it is also necessary to spend some money. After all, he still knows the rules for filing pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you spend too much money, you will definitely have problems, so he followed his brother and finally found him going to an underground casino in Orodo. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the underground casino is actually a three-story small building with five or six tables, and all kinds of gambling games, winning or losing are limited. He sneaked into his brother when he was not there. After playing for a while, he lost a dozen dollars. He felt that this was not the right thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin is here, he will tell him that the girl has a problem, but Graf does not have this kind of brain, but he has a special ability, that is Dry and so on. Finally let him wait for Kelly to come to the casino alone, and hug a small gang with the casino. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told his brother about this and canceled the check authorization from his bank to his brother. In a nutshell, he cut him off. The economic expenses of the younger brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought this was the end of the matter, until a few days before Graf was beaten by his girlfriend, he found that his checkbook was small. Several pages. He went to the bank and checked the account and found that there were already 17,000 blocks in a short period of time. This is not a small amount. In Orodo, the capital of Cannes, buy a house for four or five thousand, and a far-away villa is about the same price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short month, his brother lost a villa? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason he had a big fight with his brother, and he first hit his "cultural man" brother, and then his brother disappeared. Then someone sent him a message. If he wants his brother to come back safely, he will prepare 100,000 pieces, otherwise they will send his brother to see God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Six Gods, Graf can only return to Tener, looking for an acquaintance on the street to contact Du Lin, who is now pinning all his hopes Du Lin. Money, he doesn't care, he only hopes that his brother can come back safely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just wants to see, what is the matter of the Buddha, if he needs his help, he can also help, if he thinks that he has found his own "destiny", Du Lin Will also let him stay in Orodo. After all, I have been together for a few years. Everyone has been a family. Du Lin has no habit of embarrassing himself. He even hopes that every family member can have a good home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He arranged a weekend reception, then took the steam locomotive directly to the nano-Linddes, where there was a tributary of the Sedona River. Take the boat directly down the river and enter the river Agate. Although the distance is almost the same, the waterway is more comfortable than a steam locomotive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon on Saturday, as a small passenger ship docked in Orodo, Doolin patted a few clothes and boarded along with other visitors. The land of Orodo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South is always hotter than the North. He had already considered it before he came, but he did not expect to be able to heat it to this extent! Even wearing short sleeves, sweating, and the Ordos at this time is like the city of Otis in August, it is the most vicious season of the sun. He stood on the dock and looked around for a while. He immediately walked with a smile and walked toward the parasol not far away. A tall and big body rushed out from under the umbrella. The two hugged a bit. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my good brother, Du Lin...", Graf did not introduce all of Du Lin’s situation, and he was both Years have grown a lot of brains. Second, Du Lin is here to do something special, and it is not convenient to tell his current identity. Then Graf let off half of the body and proudly introduced his girlfriend to Du Lin. "This is my girlfriend, Daphne."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Daphne looked at Du Lin, Du Lin was also looking at the woman... oh... Child, it should be a woman accurately. She has a head of one meter and eighty, which is about five or six centimeters higher than Du Lin. It looks like a big skeleton and a strong body. He can only think of the word solid, but it is not too fat, it belongs to the type of micro-board. Looks like it’s gone, but it’s always a bit awkward to add her skeleton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this kind of thing, Du Lin can’t do it, and the Lord can’t take him to the Lord. Everyone has his own heart. Maybe Graf likes this tone. ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He politely reached out and shook hands with Daphne, and at the touch of the moment, the three men walked toward the outside, and Graf introduced the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is really a six-god, and if he is not kidnapped, he may dare to find those people desperately, but when he thinks that his brother is in their hands, Graf will be paralyzed. A similar mistake he once made, may have left some psychological shadows, so after the incident, he first remembered Du Lin. Graf bought a car, not too good or bad, about six thousand in the early appearance In a word, "Go to the Governor's Office!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Oh! Well, I know the way.", Graf seems to have returned to the past two years. In short, everything is right to listen to Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was his girlfriend, Daphne, who looked back at Du Lin and curiously asked, "Do you know the people in the Governor's Office?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and didn't answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor’s Office is located in the city’s city centre and is very easy to find. In this bustling metropolis, only the Governor’s Office still maintains the traces of the past. The towering walls and the power grid above make people feel a sense of incomprehensibility. The copper gates with rust are thick and distinguished, and there are some idols and monsters in the mythology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pressed the doorbell after getting off the bus. It didn’t take long for a middle-aged man in his forties to appear behind the door. He looked at him with some vigilance. Lin, softly asked: "You are?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, I am Du Lin, come to Dudu."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Mr. Doolin?", the man’s face suddenly smiled. "Please wait a moment, I will immediately inform Mr. Dufo."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not care that he was rejected. The big family had the rules of a big family. Even if the Governor had already seen God, the rules were still left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the bronze doors were all open, not only did the Buddha appear, but Vivian also followed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come you?", the brothers hugged a bit, and all the Buddha’s surprise, Du Lin did not inform him before, suddenly appeared People feel an accident. Soon his eyes crossed Du Lin and saw Graf behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
