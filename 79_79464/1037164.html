			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a good time to talk about business right away after dinner. Regular business activities often schedule a break of one to two hours after the meal to make each other Get full relaxation and rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use scientific methods to explain this behavior because people have just eaten, and a lot of blood in the body is concentrated in the stomach and intestines, promoting digestion and absorption, so Blood flow in other places will decrease, causing the oxygen content of brain cells to drop, and thinking will sometimes get into trouble. Only after the end of the initial stage of digestion, the flow of blood returned to normal. A large amount of oxygen-filled blood flew through the brain again. The activity of brain cells with increased oxygen content was liberated, thinking faster and responding faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the less scientific saying that people eat a lot of food, these foods have ruined their lives, and young grievances are wrapped around the diners. Give them trouble. Only after praying or waiting for these little grievances to disappear naturally will they not be affected by these unclean things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter what the reason, people need to take a break after eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp sitting in the living room is lying on the sofa, his mouth is slightly open with his eyes closed, and if he approaches, he can hear his grunt . He was very tired during this time, and any fragmentation time was a good opportunity for him to rest. Taking advantage of Mr. Tucks' free time to enter the bedroom, he leaned on the sofa for a while. As the hour hand of the clock clocked at nine o'clock, the dangdangdang's bell began to reverberate in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp has some confused and raised his arm and wiped his mouth with dry, crusted saliva. He will drool when he sleeps, just like a child. . Rubbing his eyes, a sullen expression on his face flashed away. He lifted his wrist and glanced at the watch, stood up with his armrests, and staggered to the bathroom. The simple combing and the stimulation of the cold water made him look a lot better when he came out. Mr. Tucks had already packed himself and sat on the side of the sofa. The two men nodded and said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they came back from the restaurant, Mr. Tucks called the accountant, and the accountant said that he would be saved soon. It has been more than forty minutes now. It should also appear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounting is a very important person. According to the current requirements of the imperial accounting profession, any company that meets the tax standard must employ an accounting qualification and The relevant personnel of the Imperial Taxation Bureau have registered as the accounting of the enterprise. At the same time, the books that have been made during the period of employment are also kept in accounting. When necessary, the tax bureau can directly look for accounting to conduct account reconciliation and directly skip the enterprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the accountant must have the account book of the jewelry store when it first started operating. At the beginning, Du Lin did not have any more funds than the one at hand, which could support a large jewelry store. . He must have used the gold that was robbed. As long as the accountant did not make false accounts, he could find from the books that there were some minor problems in the early investment of the jewelry store. For example, Du Lin lacked funds to purchase goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The western mine owners are a group of people who don’t see cash and will never ship, especially precious metals. There are too many scammers in this year. Before entering your pocket, any credibility is deceptive. And this will definitely be reflected in the books, even if Du Lin finds the right excuse, can not change the fact that his dividends and the amount of his purchase there is a certain gap. As long as this can be locked in, and then look for the gold provider and then the account, Du Lin's doubts are locked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Alisa and others confessed to Doolin, then Doolin would be locked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Amp is ready to ask if Mr. Tucks’s accountant is delayed on the road, a group of cooks in the Dinger Hotel not far away listen to them inexplicably The boss told me to make ten tables of banquets. Hundreds of guars dressed in plain style walked into the banquet hall. They continued to thank the president of this place for the generosity of Mr. Doolin. Thanks to Mr. Doolin for not forgetting in the west. They, and invited them to eat a hearty meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this has nothing to do with the other side, Ms. Sophia did not appear because she already appeared in the hotel on the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two agents stunned when the elevator door was opened. A very graceful lady appeared in the elevator. She wore a black evening gown, slightly Lifting the chin gives a very noble feeling. Standing behind her, there are six other young people in formal attire. The clothes and the good materials all indicate that they are the ladies' followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this very honorable lady, she stepped out of the elevator door, and a detective immediately smiled and blocked the position of the lady." I am very sorry, dear lady, this layer has been wrapped up, it is now a private space. If you have any needs, I can help you to convey the front desk.", the landline phone is in the corridor behind him, can contact anytime, anywhere Go to the front desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinguished lady smiled. At the moment when the agent bowed his head, two pistols were extended from behind the lady, pointing to the two agents. . The two were made a little bit back to the gods by this sudden change. The noble lady continued to move forward, her hand gently pressed on the shoulder of the detective, and smiled sideways at him. "Child, the wrong place." It’s not me, it’s you!”, then she pushed her hand a little, and the detective was pushed aside, maybe he took the initiative to let it go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two agents were disarmed and tied up, and a cloth strip was placed to stop them from shouting, and a follower placed the trash can between the elevator doors. When the elevator door that keeps closing is caught in the trash can, it is separated again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hotel has a total of ten elevators, four public elevators can only reach the tenth floor, and guests living on the eleventh to sixteenth floors need to turn on the tenth floor. Take another separate elevator to your own floor. There is a trash can across the elevator door, no matter what happens here, no one will come up to interfere with what is happening here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia came to the fourth floor of the 14th floor according to his communication with Line 2, and he was a little older and looked like The young man in his thirties took the initiative to knock on the door and let Ms. Sophia stand in the same place, just like a lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It must be her, I am going to open the door for her." There was a man’s voice in the room, and then after a few footsteps, the door Opened, the person who opened the door looked at Ms. Sophia, and Ms. Sophia smiled and walked straight in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment Amp stood up, there was a trace of doubt in his eyes. Can an accountant have this temperament? Even if there is, then why should I go to be an accountant? When he just reached out, there was a gun behind the lady, and the muzzle pointed at Amp. Amp was suspiciously keeping his hand out, and his face gradually changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you, we don't know you." He looked at the people while glanced at the gun and stood in the door. Tucks, "This kind of behavior is very rude, you are looking for the wrong person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia smiled and went to the other side of the coffee table, she Sitting in the paragraph, shaking his head slightly, at this moment actually gave Amp a dazzling feeling, just like a very noble lady sitting opposite her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't find the wrong person, Mr. Lapuan.", Sophia's voice with some hoarseness, but does not make people feel very serious particles Feeling, but because this silky hues give people a mellow and charming feeling, "My name is Sophia, you must be very curious why I will be here, actually I am cooking for my family at night, but I got a call. He named him to see you, so I had to take off my apron temporarily and come here to help him achieve his wishes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
