			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Williams and his wife and brother, and the financial company owner who borrowed money from him, sat in their trading seats, and the three eyes did not look at it. Looking at Atlantic Chemical's stock prices soared. Since Befort has told him this little internal news, after him and his wife and brother, the boss of the finance company has also been pulled down. For this unpredictable big market that Befort said, he not only mortgaged all his own industries to the bank, but also borrowed a lot of money from the finance company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he has at least three million federal shield funds in the stock account, and every minute is increasing in a certain proportion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people say that finance is the best thing in the world, because as long as you sit still, you can see your wealth expand rapidly at a terrible speed. Mr. Williams, who had not known much about this issue before, is now very certain that the person who said this sentence must be the super big winner of the horse. He loosened his clenched fist and had some whitish knuckles. In the last five minutes, he had more than seven thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have never been so horrible to make money, he, his wife and the boss of the finance company are constantly drinking water, crazy rising stocks let them adrenal gland There is some excess of secretion, and it needs to be supplemented with more water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"William, how much do you think this time can rise?", his wife and brother asked, this time he also got the blood, the last big He only caught half of the market, but it was enough to make him convinced by the rise and fall of the financial market. For this reason, like Mr. Williams, he mortgaged everything through his own channel and then seized the market. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Williams said very vagously, "Reassure, at least double, triple is not impossible!", he has a very good assessment of himself Confidence, Atlantic Chemical has begun accepting orders, and has invited some people to the lab to research new materials, and the results are surprisingly consistent – ​​Atlantic Chemical is likely to become the most profitable chemical company in the Federation and the world. A lot of people have started to submit reports to apply for their new patents to "contrast" the patents in their own labs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, whether or not someone wants to make these new materials privately will not shake the future benefits of Atlantic Chemical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the three people were chatting happily, discussing the warmth of the place after the end of the year, Bethford rushed in and rushed into the company manager's office, less than a moment in front of Williams. Suddenly it rang. The sudden ringing of the phone made him frightened, and the whole person shook, and a feeling of uneasiness began to pervade. He looked at the phone that was ringing and waited for a long time before reaching for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The printing company of "Good Morning" is frantically printing a supplement, just received the latest news, although there are two, but these two actually say It is the same thing, something related to Atlantic Chemical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of discussion about Atlantic Chemical during this time, very hot, everyone is discussing what new materials will bring to people’s lives. Variety. They even made some daily necessities with new materials, including clothes and the like, which is really great, and many people can't wait to buy them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but just two "disasters have happened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first disaster is the Atlantic Ocean A serious explosion occurred in the newly-built chemical production workshop. They said that some potentially harmful chemicals began to spread. The local city hall has begun to evacuate the people near the chemical plant. The fire department has already entered the working state, but the feedback received is not good. The new production workshop is only twenty or thirty meters apart from the old production workshop. The explosion caused a chain reaction, and even a fire broke out in the warehouse. A large number of chemical substances began to spread as the wind moved further, and it was said that poisoning casualties had occurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a private laboratory of the Empire issued a message to the countries that they believe that the patents registered by Atlantic Chemical are not correct, or It is forged, because the patents according to their application simply cannot extract anything of the same nature as the products they display. At the same time, a large part of the patent is suspected of plagiarizing infringement, and they deceive everyone. And in this private laboratory through a study of the chemical patent formulations submitted by Atlantic Chemical over the years, many of them involved fraud, and they secretly used other patents that have already been registered. This is a fraud and should be condemned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why companies that have been infringed with patent rights have not found it before, that is another matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two news, the huge problems facing Atlantic Chemical directly reflected in the stock price, before the Federal Financial Management Committee asked the two major trading houses to suspend Atlantic Chemical In five minutes, Atlantic Chemical's share price was directly swayed, and more than two billion federal shield funds were evaporated in the stock market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The microphone in his hand fell from the hands of Mr. Williams. He stood up and walked out of the trading room. When he was about to leave, he looked back at the time on the calendar. On November 23, he left only the New Year. Eight days! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden bad news caused the entire stock market to stop for a few seconds, this time Atlantic Chemical has pitned a lot of people, including many companies and capitalists. The Atlantic Group is one of the emerging consortiums of the Federation. Many of the powerful companies have made many people very optimistic about the Atlantic Group. They have long held the shares of these companies, and they have indeed made a lot of money. But the bad news that suddenly came out was not just that a stock in Atlantic Chemical was falling, and all the stocks associated with Atlantic Group began to show a downward trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most serious reason for this is because of the spread of chemical pollution, the local city hall has issued an urgent notice requesting evacuation of the city. No matter how you end up, you need the Atlantic Group to pay for the disaster. If there are a large number of deaths, it is highly probable that Atlantic Chemical will be directly split and file for bankruptcy. This is a very terrible blow to a consortium and a new consortium. A bad deal, maybe the Atlantic Group company will be swallowed by other large consortiums, this deadly point is enough for them to wave the knife and fork to cut the Atlantic consortium! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 4:17 pm on November 23, with a loud bang accompanied by a slight vibration on the ground, it was called by the federal financial history. The black New Year's financial disaster has kicked off! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CEO of Atlantic Chemical has been invited to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to drink tea, and members of the department responsible for safe production have been invited to participate in some unique questionnaires, local army It also began to draw up the long live loss of human and material resources, but the results were minimal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many chemical products and raw materials are harmless when stored separately, but after high temperature and sufficient mixing, a large amount of toxic gases and floating particles are produced. These things have begun to pollute the city. Local fire stations and the military want to find out which toxic substances are spreading again, so that the disaster can be extinguished in a targeted manner. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at this time, who can tell clearly, it is said that when the production workshop exploded, many people have returned to their faith in the Kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire federation is discussing the disaster, and at the same time, there is a thick layer of dark clouds in places that ordinary people cannot see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the explosion of the Atlantic Chemical production workshop in the afternoon, a large number of short-selling federal shield trading orders suddenly appeared in the foreign exchange market, the number is extremely amazing. Such a neat and short-selling is obviously organized and premeditated, and the Atlantic chemical disaster has dragged the short-term decline of the entire stock market, and the federal shield has begun to point downwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Federal Shield is very dangerous now, I think it should remind our customers to clear their positions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp A manager in the Forex exchange is talking to the broker about these things. "The federal shield has risen too fast, and some people feel terrible. We only spent less than four months in less than four months. This is not in line with the trading rules!" According to the current exchange rate of the foreign exchange market, once a four-fourth star has become one to two. The speed is absolutely abnormal and does not conform to the law of the free market. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And...", the manager stopped talking and shook his head. "The arrangement is the first, and our own coin bins are all empty. Let's take a look." The situation goes on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This happened in many financial trading companies, and the sudden huge shorting made them smell a dangerous atmosphere, accompanied by some people willing I believe that I am willing to avoid risks. They have emptied their own currency warehouses. A large number of selling has begun to make a short "return" for the federal shield that has been rising for more than a quarter. Of course, this is something that unbelievable trading brokers tell their customers. At the same time, in Doolin’s manor, he saw the deputy governor of the Commonwealth Bank who had just become friends with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need to borrow a federal shield...", Doolin put two suitcases on the table, opened and filled with banknotes , not a federal shield, but a star. He spread his hands and smiled and said, "We are friends, are we?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy governor glanced at the two suitcases stuffed with banknotes. Sucking a sip, "How much do you want to borrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"10 billion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This sentence suddenly made the experienced deputy governor understand something. He almost stood up and looked at Du Lin with a look of horror. "Is you shorting the federal shield?" He immediately shook his head and said "No, this won't work! And you don't have enough credit to borrow from the Commonwealth Bank to the money. It's not that I don't help you. I really can't make such an important decision."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
