			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Du Lin returned to here again, the entire yard has been cleaned up, it is hard to imagine a trip here last night. Super carcass, even a piece of shredded paper was found in the lawn, and the swimming pool was cleaned up again. Everything is like a person's illusion, just as it has never happened. Du Lin was very satisfied with the service attitude of this Owena brokerage company. They won the approval of Doolin with their attitude, so Du Lin transferred the business card from his state of being abandoned to his business card holder. Maybe when can he still Use these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushing open the door of the villa, it is exactly the same as the outside, clean and can't find any dust, just as Du Lin was as clean when he first came. However, there is a difference. There is a floral fragrance in the air. It is an air freshener designed to block some special flavors. After all, the villa is big, it is impossible to have so many rooms, there are always some people who will just take a look at it, and it is possible that these people like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villa is very quiet..., Du Lin’s footsteps, he is wrong, and there is a voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed the voice to find a master bedroom, not the one he slept, no one except him and the licensee. He got to the door and heard a very rhythmic snoring inside, not the kind of squeaky voice, like a kind... when he was punished by Mr. Xema because he did something wrong when he was a child. I took off my pants and slammed the board on the trough of the stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at the house number, this is Kevin’s room, he couldn’t help but smile and gently pushed the door open a gap. The voices became bigger and there were some other voices, such as a man who endured the painful sullenness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sneaked a glance at the inside and saw that the supermodel was only worn by the poor, and the broken leather was stitched together with the simple clothes that the body could not cover. There is also a wooden board used by the peasant woman to beat the clothes. He is doing a lot of punishment for Kevin on his mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s entry shocked the two, and the supermodel stunned, then wrapped the sheets and wrapped themselves up and stood aside. Du Lin looked at her and smiled. "Your work is over. I can see that my brother likes you very much. This is another one you deserve..." Du Lin wrote a two thousand piece. The check, stuffed in the gap between the girl's undressed poor man wearing a worn leather, the girl endured a surprise smile on Du Lin's face, then lost the sheets and walked into the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, can you help me?" Kevin looked at Du Lin a little embarrassed. "You didn't say that you came back in the morning, can you open your hand and my legs are numb."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at Kevin’s wolverine and couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “It’s morning, and you didn’t tell me that you like this exciting game, you can see you. I am happy, why not keep this position for a while, maybe I can relive it for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a blind man, I am a disabled horse Man, can you let me go and laugh at this first?", Kevin blushes, not everyone will feel calm in such a situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his hands and made a surrender. "Okay, let us free the bad boy from the bondage." He untied Kevin. Four handcuffs, and then Kevin rushed into the bathroom, he needed to wash and change a suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than half an hour, when Du Lin had already smoked the second cigarette, Kevin was rejuvenated from the second floor. He sat down beside Du Lin and picked up the cigarette case on the table and ordered one. "You shut up first. First of all, I am not a bad boy. In addition, the fact is not what you see." Kevin spit a smog. Go out, "You haven't been a lawyer, you haven't been a successful lawyer, you never know what we are facing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know at this time My mother had an ass, or for some other reason, Kevin was a little open-minded. "You have asked me how to treat moral issues. I told you that it is okay to believe that your agent is not guilty, but this is really the case. Is it easy to do? At the beginning...", he suddenly stopped. The super-high supermodel also came down from the second floor. She carried a big bag and saw that there were a lot of strange things inside, she Not to mention the goodbye to the two people at all, they left the villa, and did not even ask if there was any car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a charming girl...what have we just said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin reminded him, "You said that at the beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the beginning...", these two words said after the exit Kevin looked at Du Lin, Du Lin had to remind me again, and I can see that Kevin is still recollecting. "Do you remember the teacher who violated the female student? He let one of the children jumped upstairs, then he found me and promised to help him. Winning the lawsuit, in addition to the one I deserve, I will give me two thousand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think I don't know what he did? According to my investigation, he did a lot more than what he had already revealed, but I helped him win the lawsuit and let some more victims shut up. Because they know they can't win the lawsuit. Not only will they lose a lot of money to hire a lawyer, they will also lose their family's decent, but they will not get anything at the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that I have sold my conscience for the sake of getting two thousand pieces and my peers. Of course, this is also true, but the accumulation of every case that violates my conscience over the years has always made me uneasy. I was a high school student at the law school. If it wasn't for the bastard who wanted to grab my girlfriend, my first wish was to be a prosecutor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So Sometimes, when things accumulate, more and more uneasiness needs to be vented in a different way..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin listened very seriously, The question is also very serious, "For example, spanking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell!", Kevin mad at the moment, "Can you forget that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You mean you were spanked?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin opened his mouth and finally decided not to speak because he didn't know what to say, he was brewing Du Lin seems to have no feelings for so many emotional results. Well, he is ugly, and there is no room for explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled forward and back, finally patted his shoulder, hooked his neck and pulled him to his side, "Hey, man, that is You don't need to explain it to anyone in your life. Of course, if you make me unhappy, maybe I will remember this from time to time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The moment before also made him irritated and helpless, the next moment became so understanding, Kevin suddenly felt that he was eaten by Du Lin, of course, he definitely did not admit that there was a mysterious little touch in his heart. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two talked about the conversation, and Adams and others resurrected and walked down the stairs, and they saw that their steps were lighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yesterday was a wonderful night, but unfortunately you are not here, boss.", Adams was half lying on the sofa, looking at the luxurious ceiling and huge crystal lamp Long sighed, "That's why we have to climb up..." He looked at other lawyers in the law firm. "If you want to live like this forever, you have to be in this industry." The most amazing one, I promise that you will have this kind of life every day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if you are satisfied with some small achievements, you may soon become one of those girls. I know that there are several places that like big boys like you."<br /><br />&nbsp Adams is very clever. He knows how to manage the team that encourages him and knows how to use the power of the team. This is Duolin's reassurance, otherwise he can't be a very famous rogue lawyer. It is even less likely to attract Kevin, the unscrupulous pursuit of victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your work continues, I will go out with Kevin." Du Lin saw what he was going to see and patted his legs. Stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adams immediately patted his chest and promised, "Don't worry about the boss, everything is under control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The two men got into the car, and Kevin asked curiously after putting the crutches. "Where are we going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin let people go forward Said, "You didn't introduce a woman to me to know, is it the kind of information and statistics work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin recalled However, this is the case. "You said Nomi? She is now the director of the Information Office, but she has moved from the Ministry of Justice to the Social Services Department. Are you looking for her?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there something? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course something! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full name of the Information Office is now the Imperial Society’s Open Information Statistics Office, except for the powers and terms of reference that may have existed forever in writing. This information office has also put the work of resettlement and repatriation in the hands of it. It is no longer an ordinary and insignificant small department, and will inevitably become a vital department in the future. Of course, Du Lin believes that once the immigration problem becomes a social issue, the Imperial Society's public information and statistics office will be split into two parts. The part responsible for managing the immigration will definitely set up a new bureau or department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter what happens in the future, there are now immigrant-led immigration jobs in the hands of the information department, and they also have the special work of public information census records. This is an important relationship between Doolin and Maggs, and the use of the West as a pilot to carry out commercial insurance and social infrastructure insurance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
