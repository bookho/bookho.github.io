			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is satisfied after a meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bain succeeded in closing his aunt’s wife, and Mrs. Bain was satisfied with her husband’s ascension. As for Alisa, she could only laugh. Laughter, she is not sensitive enough in this regard. It is not clear how great Mr. Bain is now. In short, it should be very remarkable, because her mother’s face has been smiling and she has not said anything to her. Feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warmth of life makes the flow of time very fast, the second day of the blink of an eye, the pace of life on Sunday is still quite slow, in the special When she was working, she was already working, and returned to Orodo just got out of bed. After a lot of grooming, I changed my clothes, went downstairs and sat at the table with my parents, eating delicious mornings, listening to the mother's smug show of glory and embarrassment, she felt that life has never been more fulfilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the end of the breakfast, the warm family time is over. The violent knock on the door made Mrs. Bain frown and went to the door, and Mr. Bain stood up in confusion. Just as Madame Bain opened the door, a huge force pushed the door open and slammed into Mrs. Bain’s face. She screamed and smirked, but the visitor did not have the slightest pity and stay. The detective with the abbreviation of the Police Investigation Bureau on the line grabbed the pistol and rushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a guy in a suit and a suit, walking in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bain frowned and stood in front of Alisa, and he stood up and looked up at the uninvited guests who broke into his house. "I am Bain, deputy director of the Transportation Bureau. Can you break into this place without an invitation? What do you want to do? Orodor is the capital of Cannes, no matter what reason you have, you must With a fair attitude, not like what you have shown...", he shook his head and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man in the suit and trousers also stumbled. He really didn’t know that the owner who lived here was the deputy director of the Transportation Bureau, although it was a bit unexpected. But it does not hinder his work, let alone the deputy director, that is, the director is useless. He took out a subpoena and placed it in front of Mr. Bain. "Director Baine, the governor asked us to bring Miss Alizar, the insider of the alleged Torn gold robbery, back to Tener. It is our law enforcement certificate. If you have any comments or opinions, you can respond to the state court and the governor, but please cooperate with us now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the tone is very strong, it has already weakened in momentum. If Mr. Bain is not an official now, they may take Alisa away without explaining the explanation. After all, this case involved the old and new bipartisan and the Imperial Central Bank, not to mention his small executor, even if the governor must work in this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bain’s face was taken over by the commander, and after carefully reading it, he licked his fist and in front of so many people he acted as Alisa. If the father asked Alisa to be taken away by him, he would lose his family as the dignity of Alisa's father. However, he also knows that none of the three forces spoken by the young man can offend him. Even any one of them has a slight misunderstanding about him, which is enough to let him lose everything he has now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one minute, he turned and picked up the stationery and pen from the coffee table, and quickly wrote a leave letter to Mrs. Bain, "Help The letter was handed over to the governor, and I accompanied Alisa to a Tener." This is the perfect solution he can think of at this extreme time. It not only preserves its own dignity, but also has no obvious resistance, but rather cooperates more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detective in the suit was relieved, and the face like a stone had a vivid expression on his face. "Thank you for your understanding, we are now On departure, there is a short train waiting for us at the station."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bain once again felt the tension of the high-level treatment of this matter, actually for their trip The people specially mobilized the steam trains and made a short column to send them, just to get them back to Tyne faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin doesn't know that he is the biggest after a day The crisis may be coming up, at this time he is carrying people out of the warehouse of the Prohibited Investigation Bureau to carry a box of private wine. These wines are all fined, and they will be destroyed at the end of the month, except for a little drink. But in order to let the governor see his existence as soon as possible is valuable and meaningful, Xiu En has not taken care of so many things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A box of wine is quickly spread across the city by truck. Although Du Lin is in jail, his Oriental Star is also finished, but this does not mean His channels also followed the demise. As long as the channel is still there, the distribution of goods is a matter of words, especially when the owners of the bars watch Du Lin dare to deliver in the daytime, he has already guessed whether this guy is on the line with Xiuen. Plus the same wine - these wines are Karel's things, the same price but only half the price of the Karur shop, but also an unlimited supply, coupled with seemingly no guarantee, immediately impressed The heart of all business people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took only one day for all of Tyrair's private wine to be sold, and Doolin's goods were used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened, why don't I know what happened now? Are you dead?", Karur sitting in his chair with a red face Cursing, he has always followed a sales philosophy of his own, that is, it is absolutely not a one-time shop. He didn't know what it was called hunger sales, but it made a lot of contributions to the price increase by asking others to take the initiative to ask for his sales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, today, there is no place to request the purchase until now, he sent people out to look around, and found no abnormalities. There are no new private wines, no strange faces, and every sales warehouse is filled with highly private wines from his factory. Where is the problem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his unclear look, and he was angry! How much did they lose on this day? Do they know? The profits of tens of thousands of pieces disappeared so inexplicably, but they did not know what happened? Is this playing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time someone pushed the door in. Karur had long wanted to attack. He grabbed the glass on the table and lost it. The unexpected was unexpected. I was stunned. The young guy squinted his head and blood ran down his nose. He lowered his head and dared not speak, letting the blood ticking and falling on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to ask me if you want to speak?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The young man snorted and his eyes flashed away. "I just heard a friend say that now all the goods are from Du Linpu. He has a good relationship with Xiu, directly from the RCA warehouse. Take out the goods we have been fined and resell them to those merchants..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone thought that Karur would be furious, he still calmed down With a smooth chin in one hand, he rubbed his hand and let all his subordinates leave his office. He shook his head slightly, and when he heard the two monks of Doolin and Schoen blended together, he was not as violent as his subordinates had guessed, because he smelled a subtle scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Doolin is enough to cause headaches. The kid is really unscrupulous, and he can use whatever means, and he can fight with him. Very dangerous, not cost-effective. Not to mention Xiuen, I almost couldn’t get out of jail in the past few days. Now he is back and he is still mixing with Du Lin. His purpose is self-evident, that is, he is Karur! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
