			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether you admit it or not, there are always a few people who you must treat differently and cannot let you be your own temper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jack from the Imperial Capital is such a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin first came out with Mr. Jack when he was dealing with Mr. Jack. The 30 million gold in Doolin’s hands did not find a way. After cashing in, he spent 50,000 pieces and found a middleman to guarantee him. He found the largest underground money launder dealer who is said to be the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jack is just a pseudonym, or a code name. He belongs to a very large international criminal organization. Their leader is "King" and "Queen." ", very mysterious two people. Not many people have seen them so far, including the “many” Mr. Jack. These two people are like the brains of this criminal organization, deploying resources in all aspects, combining the resources of each of Mr. Jack's resources, or separating them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year, hundreds of millions of black gold are successfully bleached through their channels and resources, so that many people can safely and boldly pick up the bleached money. Kneeling in his hand, waving in the air. This organization has a special name called "poker", each person has its own unique code, which is commensurate with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Yaoxing Empire, the highest command of this organization is Mr. Jack. When Du Lin first came to the door, he did not see the gentleman. At that time, he and the connector said that he had a batch of dirty goods in his hand. He had a heavy weight and had to deal with it and then realized it. The other party directly rejected Doolin's business because the old and new empire and the imperial central bank were scrutinizing the way than gold. They believed that the gold was likely to flow out through the underground money laundering organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So staring at these people all the time, any action will lead to unnecessary trouble. Poker is not afraid of the top of the empire, but in order to avoid the trouble that should not have occurred, the organization rejected Doolin’s invitation to cooperate. Until last year, Du Lin came back again and put forward more than 70 million cooperation intentions. This gentleman had his first meeting. Later, because of a conflict, it caused a full-scale war between Du Lin and another gang. Under the entrustment of Mr. Jack, he stood up to mediate the incident and avoided a bloody conflict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, sometimes, the business is getting bigger, no matter if you have a reputation, others have to give you a face, Mr. Jack is like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin first came to the downstairs after coming to Otis, when Mr. Jack came down from an unremarkable car, two People look at each other and walk towards each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Welcome, Mr. Jack, I didn't expect you to come in person, this is a surprise!" Du Lin reached out and held tightly with Mr. Jack's hand. Together, he may look down on anyone, but he will not look down on Mr. Jack. It’s not how great Mr. Jack is, but the huge organization behind him is shocking. If one hundred million black gold is washed by their hands in a year, they will be able to get 30 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than one billion each year from their hands, their annual income may even exceed this number, it is conceivable that this is a group of rich people . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With money, it means strength. There are so many people who are willing to gamble for money in this world. Moreover, everyone has a price, just less. Or more differences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Jack is very easygoing, he looks fifty years old, his gray hair is a bit dazzling, his face is slightly stiff, Du Lin suspects that he is in the face Moved hands and feet. For example, those people's skin masks in the novels, or the use of similar cosmetics to change their face, these are possible. He wore a very old blue shirt, a pair of jeans, and a pair of booties that looked like a farmer living in the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled stiffly and nodded. "This is what I want to say. I have been there for more than seven months since I last met. I didn't expect you to be like this." I soon became a mayor, I have to congratulate you.", said his assistant took a suitcase from the car and stood behind Mr. Jack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo immediately greeted him and put his suitcase in his hand. Du Lin reached out and invited Mr. Jack to enter the municipality. hall. All the way, all the way, Mr. Jack couldn't help but laugh twice. He is not laughing at Du Lin or laughing at this place. Instead, he feels that a rich man with a huge price of billion is actually working in such a small building. I am afraid that Dulin or others have their own plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, if someone wants to count Duolin, then that guy must be stupid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two entered the living room, and after they put things down, they invited Mr. Jack's assistant to go to another room to drink something. There will be two people in the living room, Mr. Doolin and Mr. Jack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jack sat on the sofa, looked at the environment of the room, and finally gaze at Du Lin’s face. “Recently, your movements are not small. Many people have mentioned this to me, so I came to see it and, by the way, have a plan for investment." Mr. Jack said very casually, but Du Lin listened very carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s always uninsured for any organization to make money from a certain business or door. Who knows when this road will be broken. In particular, organizations like Poker have a large number of members. Once a business problem arises and cannot be benefited in a short period of time, it is very likely that there will be a big problem. In the larger economies, including the imperial central bank, the ability to take risks is actually more fragile. So in order to avoid the tragic thing that a screw has destroyed an "empire", the organization that has great economic strength, including but not limited to the Imperial Bank, will have a lot of investment. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; the development of this short ODIs half of people have realized that the empire a special central city would rise, these people have a keen sense of smell missed the first A round of opportunities, so they will never miss the opportunity of the second round. The first round of opportunities did not have their share. They only recognized them. Who told them not to know Du Lin, or did they have no good relationship with Du Lin? If you miss the second round, you really have to regret it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After contacting the "Queens", Mr. Jack decided to invest in a part of the industry in Otis to share the risks of the organization. These industries must be formal and have no direct or indirect relationship with their organization, but everyone knows that those things are theirs. After all, the line of money laundering has become an international organization. There are still some small means. & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp; <br <br /> & nbsp /> Doolin certainly welcome, the strength of the organization settled down here, you're telling everyone they are optimistic about the development here, which will play a very active Promote. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "are you going to do something about the project?" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Mr. Jack have come before all The plan, he did not fight with Du Lin, directly said his request, "at least 5,000 acres of land together, and what is built by ourselves. Of course, before the construction and planning of these projects, we both will sit down and negotiate, make sure you, I will not damage the interests of any party "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;After listening to Du Lin, his brow slightly wrinkled. The five thousand mu of land was not a narrow base. Many towns were not so big. This will take up about 20% of the land in his plan, which is a bit more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the observations, Mr. Jack is definitely a good hand. He clearly sees that Du Lin is somewhat dissatisfied with his request, but he did not say anything. Always smiling and watching Du Lin, quietly waiting for Du Lin to make a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, there is still a lot to invest in the entire empire, not just the place of Otis. On the one hand, the investment here is what the organization hopes he can do. After all, he has washed more than 70 million in one breath or the mastermind of the "century fraud case." In the future, there will definitely be a lot of cooperation between the two sides. The way to be close to the relationship. Secondly, they are indeed optimistic about this. At the time and place that Doolin did not know, Governor Harry has proposed the concept of "SAR". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that this concept is definitely not from Governor Harry. Otis has been in his arm for six years, and he has not made a fart for six years. How could Du Lin come, he thought of the refreshing concept of the SAR? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no matter where the concept comes from, the word and the meaning behind it have made many people feel interesting, including the new party leader, Magus, who is reviewing Harry’s submission. Plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Doolin has done well in the SAR, the first people who come here are definitely the most cost-effective people, able to have a quality industry to share the risks for the organization and Stress, while still relying on these industries to launder money or make money, isn't it the best choice? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mr. Jack’s gaze, Du Lin slowly nodded. “Yes, I accepted, but as you said, all the projects. It must be agreed by both of us before it can be implemented."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jack reveals a smile that looks so bright, if not the muscles on his face are stiff If it is a stone, it should be brilliant. "Thank you very much for your understanding. I know this is really a bit embarrassing, but please believe me, this is a good start. We will have more cooperation waiting for us!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin followed, "I hope so!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
