			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and nodded to Defu and thanked him. He took a document from her hand, looked at it and looked at all the presidents present. And the agent, he said with great satisfaction, "I have a document in your hand, you saw it. This document records some things that happened after last year's annual meeting. To be honest, I am very satisfied. I have given you out. A difficult problem, but you have paid the full score, which I did not think. Here, I need to thank everyone for your trust and support, and I also ask everyone to believe that this dream is not necessarily impossible!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last annual meeting, Doolin asked all the presidents and agents to start suspending the crime to achieve their goals, and to be more high-profile Do charity and participate in charity activities. The former is okay to say, but the latter requirement is actually a bit difficult. After all, these presidents and agents rely on Du Lin’s weapons, and they use the bright red blood and the unyielding will to lay down the current “Jiangshan”. . Violence is not the best way to solve problems, but profiteering is the best way to solve the problem-causing person. The usual means are suddenly not allowed to be used again, which will fall into some trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lion begins to fight, some despicable dogs become mad. But, fortunately, Doolin let them understand that in this civilized and courteous country, in addition to violence, there is a means of overriding violence. , called law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law is used to restrain people's behavior. The law never tells people what to do. It only tells people what they can't do. But the law is something that exists in written form. It is not alive, so the law passes the mouths of a group of special creatures called lawyers, telling everyone what can't be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Empire, in the Commonwealth, the more civilized and ruled the country’s lawyers, the greater the effectiveness of the lawyers. It seems that this is a good thing, because the trial of sin is ultimately Will fall in the hands of the people. According to the relevant provisions of the Empire and the Commonwealth, when a case has a certain influence, as well as a criminal case, the power of the final trial to be guilty will fall into the hands of the jury. The jury is an ordinary person. Most of them are restricted to the level of education. Many of them are illiterate. They don't know any great people. They only have a normal attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the law requires them, they will stand up and preside over justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, before they preside over justice, they still need to go through a process called auditing, and the lawyer will say the basis of each law and their own foothold. Finally, the jury decides the merits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a large extent, it can be said that lawyers often represent the law and a certain degree of justice. The more powerful the lawyer, the more representative of justice and justice, such as Mr. Kevin who used to be a rogue barrister. He has never experienced any failure since he started his career. He has been mythic. In other words, he may be the embodiment of justice. Because he is on the side and which side will win, is this coincidence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this is the power of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be a more complicated formula. In short, we have come to a final result, and money is equal to justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More money is equal to justice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many presidents and agents present here who are short of money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course no, everyone here is very rich, maybe they are better than those well-known entrepreneurs, but they are better than people in the same class. They are more rich, and they also have a boss named Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of money, influence and lawyers, these people finally experienced the life of high society figures. Like the phrase "I want to tell you that even the pants can't afford to wear", the rotten short sentences in the folk finally gave them a chance to experience it. In the past year, the group has launched more than 700 lawsuits. There are two or more lawsuits happening almost every day. The most people have a lawsuit to fight almost every week. Du Lin took away the weapon called "violence", but gave them something more civilized and more terrible - a golden sword. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the church system of the zheng religion, the knights of the heresy trials have a golden sword that symbolizes kindness and justice. Fairness and judgment are swords that cut off all sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword is now in their hands, a sword that is more advanced than violence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has always been worried that this group of people may not be able to control the desire to use violence and undermine his plan, because violence is addictive. When people are used to solving problems with their fists, they face a complicated problem. Why can a problem solved with a punch not only cost the brain but also spend money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: Because of civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin gave them the old coats that had savagely developed in the early days, and put them on a civilized coat, plus this group of people worked very well throughout the year. I have been doing charity on my own site. They now have more or less fame, not bad names, and good names. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did a good job of Doolin’s account, so Du Lin would give them a new return. He never takes these people's support for himself as a matter of course. There is no such thing as love for no reason in the world. There is always a reason to do it. Du Lin firmly believes that he can lead all the Guars to stand up and re-establish themselves in this world. Whether in return for these people's feelings for themselves or their own ambitions for the world, Du Lin will not stop and will not terminate. His gift to these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a request...", he ordered a cigarette, and said with a smile, "I want you to go back and submit to the local new party." The application for joining the party."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, even if these people in the room have already experienced the hurricane, the wind and the waves, they are not changed, they are also showing strange things. expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Alfonso stood up and Du Lin remembered him, this is a wolf. Whether he was an agent, he became the president of the club in the Somalia region. He had a nickname on the side of Somalia, called "black blood," saying that the blood flowing in his body was black because he was a demon. He quickly completed the cleansing of the Somalia region with cruel and violent means. Now there is only one force in Somalia, that is, the fellowship. People’s attitude towards him has always been polarized and very contradictory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who loves him regards him as the gospel of God, although he is not the people of that old thing. Before Alfonso became the president of the Somalia Regional Association, the area was known for its chaos, but when he went, the whole city became just a piece. There will be no more rioters squatting on the roadside and smoking cigarettes. Looking at the pedestrians and vehicles, the girls no longer have to worry about the danger of life and life when they leave the house after dark. The law and order of the whole region has reached history. The highest point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the person who hates him can also hate him a hole, and the forces of big and small are swept away by his very rude and tough means. Many people have lost great benefits, even life. He did not send the subordinates of the losers to prison like some gangs, even if the war between the forces was completed. He has always let the subordinates of those who have failed follow their leader to go to heaven to enjoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
