			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A country’s economic development can never be maintained in a very, very stable state, perhaps beyond the plan, perhaps lower than the plan, always requires development . The development of economic construction will also bring a series of chain reactions. With the recovery of the imperial economy, the volume of trade between the two countries began to increase. In particular, the federal intentional adjustment of some tariffs to normal tariffs allowed the federal economy to pass the period of adaptation from dumping to competition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many entrepreneurs who don’t quite understand this. It’s clear that there are still more than two years, why not continue to dump their goods into the empire, even if only It’s better to earn two years of money. Now you need to start thinking about a series of factors to strengthen the competitiveness of the industry within the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Council also has its own ideas. Once the domestic companies that are used to making profits through the dumping of light goods are unable to continue to make money through dumping, first They will reduce the size of the company to save money, and then there is a good chance that they will not find a way out in the process of transformation, or they will go bankrupt or go into other businesses. In the process, a large number of working class will be released to wander on the streets. These unemployed people will bring the law and order of the federal industrial cities to the most terrible extent, and even cause turmoil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s even more frightening is that if these capitalists and companies give up their original company or product because they can’t repeat the way they used to, they’ll turn to the empire. The federal dumping of low-priced goods to occupy the federal light industry market. The empire has a big advantage in this respect. They have very cheap labor, very cheap land, their fart love index, that is, the industrial production cost index is lower than the federal, even if they pay enough tariffs. It is equally competitive in a society within the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a series of adjustments to the economy in various aspects, there is no good news, for example, because of the recovery and rapid development of the federal economy, the federal economy has entered the economy. A period of rapid development, as well as the increasing number of wars in the world, the increase in trade volume, and so on, are extremely complicated. The joint parliament suddenly realized that the stable exchange rate with the empire itself may not be suitable for the current situation. Especially in the settlement of import and export trade, the federation suffered a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very obvious thing. If you compare the federal two years ago to a carriage with two horse-drawn gallops, there is only one horse in the history of the Empire. The horse-drawn carriage was connected by a chain called the exchange rate between the two carriages. The problem may not be too great. Although the federal carriage will be speed limited by the Imperial carriage, the speed limit is still Everyone can accept the scope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So two years later, the economy of the empire began to take off, the federal market became more diversified, the import and export trade became more frequent, the horses that drove the federal carriage became four, and the horses that drove the imperial carriage turned into two. . From the digital point of view, everyone has doubled. But the problem is that from the speed and trend of development, the development speed of the more mature federal free economic market is far higher than the current economic development speed of the empire, which will inevitably Bring a series of problems. Including the federal import and export trade volume has doubled this year, if you still keep this chain, it will inhibit the federal economic development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very obvious thing. People in international trade are used to settlement with the Empire Star and the Commonwealth because of the reasons for the Monetary Memorandum of Understanding. Obeying this agreement has made the exchange rate very stable, which has become the most prominent one in the international trade. The use of Imperial Stars to settle the cost of importing other countries from the federal trade has hurt the profits of the federal take-out export trade. Some businessmen have begun to voluntarily prohibit the use of Imperial Stars in foreign trade for settlement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this group of people was very cunning to register a trading company in the Yaoxing Empire, and replaced the international free floating currency market with the Imperial Star through the Empire, and then Then turn around and re-transport from the federal import goods to your real country. Although it took a circle, it still took advantage of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now a relatively simple option for the United Parliament. The first is to assist the Yaoxing Empire to help the empire’s economic development keep pace with the federal To help them achieve the true take-off of economic development, the currency relations and international monetary relations between the two countries tend to normalize. But this is a very good choice. Use your own money to help the federal development? I am afraid that the crazy "Patriots" will march outside the parliament building every day to ensure that all members of the council can not work well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second option is to temporarily liberalize the Memorandum of Understanding between the Empire and the Empire, and cut the stable exchange rate between the Star and the Federal Shield, and float freely. . This will not only make those fanatics who once again dream of re-entering the empire to eliminate tyranny, but also regret why they did not insist on continuing to attack and completely defeat the empire. They can also strengthen the circulation of the federal shield in the international market. Shield has become one of the mainstream currency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once this is done, the Federal Shield becomes the international mainstream currency, which means that the Union has a dominant position in the entire international market, they can It is also the most mainstream voice in the joint parliament to control the international financial market through various means of regulation and control, and to cut the wool itself from all over the world to strengthen the federation itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the first choice that is not so easy to accept, the second choice is clearly more in line with the requirements of the current mainstream federal society. Federal capitalists have always believed that federal businessmen should play in the entire international market. More important roles should not focus too much on how to balance the development of the empire. And the federal start in international trade earlier than the empire, this decisive factor is destined to the empire can only catch up with a goal that can never catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the highest speaker of the Joint Council initiated the meeting, whether to tear up the Monetary Memorandum of Understanding and allow the federal shield to float freely in the foreign exchange market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone talks about their opinions. I have to go home to eat with my family at night. I am older, I don't want to sit here all day. "A speaker dismissed the glasses and blinked. He let two air blowers come in and blow out the smoke in the conference room, too blind." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert, sitting at his last left, was holding a pipe. He looked at other people and gently rubbed his fingers on the table twice. . The sounds of these two voices made everyone focus on the young man named Albert. In fact, he is young, he is not young, but he is very good. The Atlantic Group, which he formed, achieved leapfrog development in just a few years. In the federal society, Albert has become an idol of many young people. Especially in the joint construction of his group company, has successfully opened the empire's market, and the empire's old capitalists fight the heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the continuous listing of various subsidiaries, Albert has only used nearly three years, from a humble young entrepreneur to A hot federal upstart, in the last year's general election, entered the Federal Supreme Council and became a member of parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people say that his success is luck, but luck itself is part of strength, because not everyone has luck, and no one can grasp it. luck. In the first half of the year, the joint construction workers also signed a 20,000-kilometer railway construction plan with several empire companies, allowing the joint construction workers' stocks to directly lead the entire construction industry sector. Recently, there was news that the joint construction workers should unite with other companies. Several companies have jointly built a “circle around the world” orbit that links the four continents, including the design of the undersea tunnel that is being tendered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a young man with a huge net worth, and every decision he makes will cause earthquakes in some industries in the Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
