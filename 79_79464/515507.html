			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the broken glass mirror, Robben saw the thin self, saw some messy Wood around him, and saw behind them, some The young face with a cap is coming over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, the gang is indeed more capable than the police to figure out something. For example, when Gigi was killed, someone saw a windbreaker with a cap. The young man approached Jiji, then took a gun out of his pocket and broke through Jiji’s head. It was a very delicate young man, and he was neutral, and some tramps even insisted that it was a girl, not a boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any case, Robben has come to a conclusion that what they have to face is a "young enemy." In addition to Graf, most of the special group is young, fifteen or sixteen, seventeen and eighty, and twenty years old. They are all Guarts, all poor and poor. They need to change something, so they became Dorian's accomplice and helped him cruelly kill his brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then at this moment, are these people behind them, are they also Du Lin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Robben’s brain seems to be back to youth. Every detail and every clue worthy of attention is stripped from countless pieces, combined in together. The next second, he reached out and grabbed Wood's collar, and in the look of Wood's stunned, rushed to the nearest car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a trap! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shouted madly, "The people upstairs are just bait, we are the target!", he forced Wood into the back seat of the car. On the top, even the door did not come to an emergency, one leg stepped into the cab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car key is still in the lock, he only needs to push a putter, let the catalyst enter the packing bin, react with the twins, and then wait a little more than a dozen In seconds, the car can quickly rush to the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been a minute or two, he heard the footsteps that are close at hand, and felt that one hand grabbed his collar and He squatted back. His face was red, grabbed the steering wheel, and the other hand touched the seat under the driver's seat. Most people liked to hide some good things there. When he touched a wrench, he felt a sharp pain in his waist. He didn't even look at it, and immediately waved his wrench to the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a muffled sound, his tiger's mouth shook a bit, and the force of grabbing his collar suddenly disappeared. He struggled into the cab, twisted the keys and pushed the putter. He was able to feel that the catalyst had started to react violently with the twins, and he could feel the slight vibration of the car body. When he leaned his head to one side, a group of young people had already rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blinking, the window glass of the cab was smashed, and several sharp knives came in at the same time and broke into his body. He gripped those people's arms with force, and the vibration of the car body was significantly stronger. He stepped on the valve and the car under his seat rushed forward and rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the back seat, Wood’s big mouth gasped, his attack was also attacked, his back was cut, and his arm was cut. A knife, there is also a mouth of about a dozen centimeters on the face, the skin is turned open, revealing the yellow oil inside the butter. He gasped with a big mouth and sighed on his body. At this time, he was most grateful for Robben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a little late, I am afraid he will be killed by those people. At the same time, he has to admit that these young people are really embarrassing and decisive enough. Every time they attack, they are going to the point. If it weren't for Wood and the habit of keeping sports, I was afraid that it would be dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you go back, let the people of Codor come, no matter how much it costs, I want that guy to die in front of me!" Gas, roaring, he knows that he is too weak, and too impulsive. He should listen to Robben's words, and wait until he is completely calm down, plan everything and then start the action, instead of ruining for revenge without any preparation, because of the loss of reason as it is today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He patted Robben’s shoulder. “Sorry, I should listen to you!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The car suddenly twisted, and Wood in the carriage slammed to one side, and slammed into the door. With a slamming sound, his shoulders were cut open by a broken glass. He looked at Robben inexplicably. He hadn't had time to talk, and the fast-moving car slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the brakes of the brakes, the tires smoked, and four black lines of more than 20 meters were drawn on the ground and finally stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roben was struggling to close his eyes, pushed the door open, and slammed it out and fell to the ground. Wood's brain was blank. He ran out of the car and looked at Robben, whose back was on the ground, and his chest was almost no longer undulating. His eyes were wet for a moment. He groaned without any purpose, roaring, kneeling on the ground and holding Robben in his arms, shaking with force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three deadly wounds, two of which pierced Robben's chest, one pierced his waist, and a lot of blood had turned Robben's favorite light brown sweater into a black-red color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough..., a spurt of blood, Robben seems to be a little better, he opened his eyes and looked at Wood, slowly raising his hand, tight Grabbing Wood's sleeves, "Ring...Traveling...", the last word he couldn't say. After a tight body, his body relaxed and relaxed, and his hands slowly fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Robben who had lost his vital signs, Wood was silent for a moment. He endured the pain in his body and stuffed Robben into the back cab. At this time, there are already many people around, but he does not care. He swears that he will avenge his brother, no matter what the cost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, a killing has just begun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s heart was in the back of the guy who had been stalking in the alley. In fact, three days ago, he found that such a person has been The company constantly observes the dynamics within the company. He thought that he was hiding very well, but who would wear a dome hat every day, wearing a high-necked trench coat every day, hiding himself in an alley? So he decided to buy the house next door, and then secretly made a door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the guy outside thought Du Lin didn't leave, Du Lin had already moved to the back room. Then I changed my clothes, crossed the road, and went to the building next to the guy. He also rented a floor in the building to deal with possible enemy attacks at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wood appeared, all his actions were rewarded several times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrians on the street are not screaming to leave, just standing silently watching everything. Doolin’s face was masked, and the guys kept breathing straight and breathing like a drowning, and he pulled out with a sharp knife of blood. Some people have already withdrawn from the company at this time, but when they saw a group of young people holding a sharp knife and stabbing the five people who were outside, they found that Wood and Robben had disappeared. There is a blank in the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obvious that they have an advantage, and they clearly say that the other side is hiding on the third floor. Why is the situation suddenly reversed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
