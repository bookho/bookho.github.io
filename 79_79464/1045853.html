			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma looked back at the reading glasses on the table and several newspapers. He nodded and said, "Yes, I already know, you Is it a matter of calling back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question has caused Du Lin to have some idea of ​​how to answer, he really wants to explore this thing. Mr. Kesma’s tone. If Mr. Kesma’s temper is coming up, he must take a gun to take a revenge journey. He is following it, is it followed, or is it followed? Regardless of the outcome, it is definitely not the best result, because there is no right or wrong in this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Du Lin didn’t think that Mr. Kesma didn’t seem to care at all, it’s very light, and even the tone became a little Alleviated a bit. This made Du Lin feel a trace of horror, is it true that the old man has to sneak out and sneak out of revenge? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you be sad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma is silent for about six or seven Eighty or ninety seconds, "Sadness? There may be a little..." When he said this sentence, the tone was very uncertain, just like someone asked you to be a rich person. Answering is full of uncertain factors. Very reluctant, "I understand what you mean, you can rest assured, I will not do anything, it has nothing to do with me. When they let them go, they are not willing to go. From that day on, the relationship between us has been almost cut off. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't do anything irrational for an old friend who hasn't seen it for more than 20 years. I still need to take care of the children. And the son of your bastard, there is no more love for others. If you have nothing, you can hang up the phone, and honestly I hear your voice is even more angry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr. Xerma was disheartened, he wanted to bring everyone back to the farm. Live, he was not a very extreme...not a person with a strong desire for power. He did what he did just because he could not understand the luxury and spoiled life of the nobles, and wanted to save some people who were oppressed and exploited. . To say ideals, there must be some, but it is limited to this. He never thought that if one day he really overthrew the rule of the nobility and the royal family, he should be the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mr. Xmas, I did what I wanted to do, which made me very happy, then I can go home Have a good life, wait for the crops and raise some animals, that is the day when people live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shapk’s death made him a little uncomfortable, but what about the uncomfortable? Difficult to let go of your wife and a family, give up the quiet life now, and push everyone back into the flames? That is impossible. Although he seems to be a neuropathy, and sometimes it is a neuropathy, he is not mentally retarded, and his normal thinking ability has not been greatly deviated. In order to have not seen each other for more than two decades, I even dared to refuse such a great sacrifice to my good friend that night. That is a neurosis, and it is still a golden disease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sometimes it’s not possible to think of Mr. Duxma in the normal way of thinking, just when Doolin feels that he can put down the phone and let go of his heart, Mr. Finally added a sentence, "Yes, you have never sent a black post to the doorman, I am going to give him a copy, you still have a week, before May 10, I want to see the doorman in the newspaper. The news that the hybrid died. Ok, I hang up the phone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin, who also hangs up in Villier, felt for the first time Stomach pain, when I used to communicate with Mr. Kemas, I often had a toothache, and then the egg hurts. Now my stomach is beginning to hurt. This...the lovely and kind old man is always surprising. He has already sent out the black post. And is there a time limit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forget the days, there are still eight days before May 10, and Doolin doesn’t know if there is anything special on May 10 this day. Meaning, but in short, Mr. Kemer gave him a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman must be destined to die, whether it is obeying the will of Mr. Xerma or his own layout in the west, the doormen must die . Previously, their intention was to get the doorman down first. When he became an "ordinary person" who was less noticeable and lost the mayor's identity, he quietly let him close his mouth forever. The plan is highly enforceable and can even be said to have been half successful, but the Mennon suddenly announced a break with the Shapk gang and saved himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Doolin’s intention was to start the door for the farmer. He still has some places to cooperate with the doormen, but Mr. Xema’s black post has been sent out. He can only obey the arrangement of Mr. Zema. If this time does not work, the character of the doorman does not say that even the toilet is protected, what if he fights a fish to die? Mr. Kesma was able to investigate the people who were the first doormen to kidnap Nasha and grab the children in the crossfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it is natural for the Mennon to investigate who the people were at the time, and with Nasha’s relationship with him, it’s not hard to conclude that Du Lin is very likely It is the descendants of Mr. Kesma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge risk. Now that the prospective farmer is still planning to put the information of himself and the old man in the hands of a large amount of chips, he will obey the wishes of Mr. Xema and kill the doormen. Next, I plan to plan how to get the doorman to get the black post and send him to see the God of Ogildin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During all day, Du Lin is thinking about this matter, how can he not disturb others, not expose himself, and can make Mr. Xema satisfied with the farmer . He thought for a long time that he did not come up with a specific plan to meet these three points at the same time. Everyone knows the relationship between him and the doorman. It seems that it is not bad or bad. In fact, he does not deal with each other. If he invites the doorman to appear on certain occasions and is assassinated, then his suspicion is the biggest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can even be said that as long as Doolin is still in Vanlier, the Mennon died, he will be suspected. So he couldn't help himself, he could only give the opportunity to give him a new trustworthy person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, how should this killer approach the doorman and kill him in silence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the vaguely, Du Lin remembered a legendary bald killer, but it is a pity that no one knows his specific intelligence information, nor can he contact this person. . Otherwise, it is also a good choice to ask him to take the shot. It is said that since he started to be an assassin, he has not lost his hand until now, and he is called the strongest killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mennon has been very careful during this time, and at least two very close personal guards at all times protect his safety. He announced that he had cut off the relationship with the bloody dawn, and even sold out the people of Shapke. With his understanding of the leader, the madman would certainly retaliate against himself. But at the same time he has another idea. Du Lin is now on his territory. If the leader does not want to go abroad and suffers from the pain of losing his son, he should not come to find his own trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Shapk’s death, the Mennon wanted a messenger to hand over a letter to the leader. There was no way for them to know the messenger’s contact. the way. In the past, those letters will be sent to all corners of the empire, perhaps the East Coast, perhaps the Imperial Capital, perhaps the South, without any rules. But in the end these letters will be sent to the leader. Shapke’s death means that the doorman’s connection with the last bit of the past has been completely cut off, and there is some fear in his heart, but more is excitement and excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dawn of the bloody dawn has enveloped him for more than 20 years. He simply didn't want to be the accountant of this group of madmen. Now the shadow seems to be spreading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still a little bit, after he campaigned for the governor and succeeded, these chips could be handed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notify all the mine owners in the west and tell them that they must come to Verrier to meet next Monday." The doorman signed the document and asked for his own The secretary sent a formal invitation letter to all the mine owners in the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary quickly wrote this note on his notebook, and then he asked, "For whatever reason or purpose, invite them to come over?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorkeeper put down his pen and glanced at the secretary. "Tell them, I want to build the largest mineral resource trading market in the entire empire in the west. If they don't want to come, he digs I will guarantee that things will never appear in the market, and no one will buy their ore!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, the Mennon has been against the West Mine. All the rules and regulations of the meeting considered that this was the power to deprive the market of free competition and development, but when the West Mine became a thing of the past, he immediately took up the idea of ​​the original rules and regulations of the West Mine. This is not his fickleness, but the power brought by this set of rules and regulations is too great! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a mayor and a governor three years later, if you want to build the West in accordance with your own policy, you need to have more work in these hands. The support of the mine owners and capitalists. After all, no matter what ambitions and ideas he has, the ultimate implementation of these things is ordinary people. It is impossible for him to implement it personally. He does not have the ability to build the western region by relying on his own alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no way of grasping the will of a certain western citizen, but as long as he seizes those who give jobs to Western citizens, then he is in control All the people in the west who have jobs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously he opposed the West Mine because the cake did not have his share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he supports the rules and regulations of the Western Mining Association because the cake belongs to him alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the use of the West Mine will not be a change without any change, and people will doubt his intentional behavior, so he will build A “free” mineral trading market and re-promoting two or three bills to maintain the dominant position in the mineral trading market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
