			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidele blinked and woke up from his sleep, and he glanced at the sky outside the curtains, which almost penetrated into the room through the glass window, now It should be midnight. He suddenly thought of something. When he turned over, he saw the Buddha. All Buddha smiled and reminded him that Du Lin was coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need to change a suit." Heidele slowly turned over and did not have a lot of things when he was old. Even if it is just a normal thing, such as turning over and getting up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young boys can pick up directly, and they can quickly turn over and do it. After a certain age, they don’t know like young people. Protect yourself and only be able to hurt yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just an ordinary to no longer get up, and Heidler has been doing it for almost a minute, but he didn’t urge him, wait quietly. On one side, then said, "No, you don't need to change clothes, this set is very suitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidele laughed and held the bedpost slowly. Standing up, "You are not wrong to say this. After all, if you want to take it off, then I will not delay the time. Where is Doolin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Outside, please come with me...", Buddha gave up some distance and led Heidler out of the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small living room after passing through the bedroom door. Of course, this small living room is also within the scope of the master bedroom. Du Lin is looking at it. In the picture of TV and TV, a guy in his thirties is waving his arms, giving him a very energetic feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Otis is the fourth city to connect cable TV signals throughout the city. After all, it is the entertainment capital. If there is no TV, then it is still entertainment. Capital? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some on-demand programs being broadcast on TV. Freena and Nasha decided to change Dolin’s previous operational strategy, which will be 20 per day. The four-hour scrolling program was changed from 7:00 am to 11:00 pm, and then began to receive private on-demand services. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The island has solved the problem of "stacking", which makes the on-demand more simple, the billing is more accurate, and this is also wired The TV group company has added a lot of revenue. There are always some elites who have missed their favorite shows lately. Now they only need to move their fingers and make a phone call to solve the replay problem. For them, it is worthwhile to spend some money to watch those missed programs. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of cable TV group companies, it has to be said that the largest piece of revenue in revenue so far is actually not advertising, but... adult channel on-demand fees. Because cable TV signals have not yet connected to all cities and regions in the whole country, many local advertisers have not paid much for advertising on TV. The real big advertisers are still waiting for the results of market verification and the popularity of cable TV signals. Under such circumstances, the on-demand broadcasting of adult programs has become an assistant to income, the rate of on-demand is high, and income is even more explosive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the cost of pursuing the ultimate beauty? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin tried a program on demand. He ordered a political interview program in the evening, for which Heidler needed to pay extra at the end of the month. He will not care about the 50-point on-demand fee, and he will not be able to care if he wants to pay attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen this show..." Heidler came out of the room in a robe and sat down, not far from Doolin, he Pointing to a politician who is talking on TV, "I know this guy, a talker, but public opinion and newspapers like him very much. His mouth is big, he dares to talk nonsense, and some ordinary people are Support him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to look at Du Lin, "Where are you here, are there any new changes?" He pointed Refers to the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin leaned back on the sofa and nodded. He was a bit tired. He was planning to come with Dudu, but he didn’t expect to come across it. One thing, an accountant of the token company jumped. If other people jump off the building, it is definitely not a big deal, but the accounting company’s accounting jumps must have big things. Every day, the entire city of Otis has more than 10 million tokens. According to the rules set by Du Lin, one percent of the fee, his daily income will be around 200,000 to 300,000. This is definitely not a A small number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a problem has occurred in this area, it means that a large number of his interests have been evacuated by some people, and he immediately went from the famous Doyle on Xie Lisi Street. The audit company temporarily hired a group of experts to go with him to the token company and found some minor problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some people who have not paid attention to the token company, and have taken away more than three million cash from the company, not once. The set is taken away by many batches and times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Du Lin conveyed his message to adjust the structure of all industries to various companies, including the token company, these locusts immediately realized that there would be big trouble. The first step in the restructuring of any company is to liquidate some of the data in the past. Three million is not a small amount. The accountant who was pulled into the water realized that something would happen, whether forced or active. In short, he jumped upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it’s not just a problem for the token company. Some other industries have more or less problems, but there is no serious problem with the token company. The private use of the public is the most, followed by the small greedy Xiaoshun, Nasha told him that a cleaner worked in the performance school on the Ilyan side for half a year, stole more than forty brooms and many garbage bags, Du Lin I can't believe that there are still people stealing this stuff... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the truth, let alone the broom garbage bag, and even the cups are secretly taken home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before coming to Heidele, Du Lin just dealt with a group of people, in front of some people, many of them are Audi The core members of the city's business group include those who are currently working in the seven major casinos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin wants them to understand the truth, they are the things they can take, not their things, they have to pay for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this makes him very tired and his heart is very tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Header saw Doolin nod. He sighed. "I knew it would be like this. Have we been abandoned?", he bit his teeth "Is there any other way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at Heidler with some surprises. The old man’s sense of smell was very sharp. He said that he still said before. I plan to run, and every successful person, no matter how successful he is, will certainly have some special places. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even if Doolin does not liquidate these traitors, the cabinet will clean them up, even if the cabinet does not move them, those capital predators will also move them, In short, apart from running, they will not have any satisfactory endings. Hanging in this society for so many years, they succeeded in attracting a lot of hatred, it is time to release these hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat back straight, he looked at Heidler and whispered, "I am very grateful for everything you have done for us in Tyne, no matter what If it is from your own intention, at least you let us get out of prison a little earlier, so I came over personally, this is something that others have not enjoyed. To put it simply, there will be no other possibility tonight, if you Can survive for three days, that is the embodiment of the will of the gods, I will send you away and let you spend the rest of your life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidele suddenly laughed and laughed. He pointed to Du Lin. "Do you really think that you are the Messiah? They all say so, do you believe it yourself?", Doolin did not Speaking, just watching him calmly, he cried with a smile and a violent cough. He coughed for a while and continued to laugh. "You really thought you were the savior. Actually, I have not understood it until now. Everyone, or are those people cheating you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter sentence is actually very interesting, and Du Lin’s heart is also very emotional, Heidler’s words The core of some things in the stamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is the Messiah. This rumor is not Dulin’s own dissemination, but the guar group of Tener’s squad, they also For Du Lin, the Messiah found the basis from the Guar's Bible. It can be said that these Guars “kidnapped” Doolin and forced him to challenge the most difficult level. But soon he began to benefit from the fact that he is the Messiah. A large number of young people are willing to die for him, many have never seen it, not even the Guar of the city of Tener. When I meet, I will worship him with incomparable trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the president of each city, and the agent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler sees it very clearly, and now Du Lin is not sure who is kidnapping, or who is cheating, if not One conclusion, that may be the need for each. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unfair treatment of the Guarts over the years has led them to hope that there will be a Messiah to save them, at least to have them as a normal person. Dignity and personality can live in the sun to enjoy the warmth. Anyone who is likely will be taken up by the group of gualts who are eager to see the light, and Du Lin just meets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Du Lin here, at that stage he needs to break all the rules and smash all the obstacles on the way, so he deepens his image in the compatriot group, Thereby gaining greater support and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, maybe it was like this at first, but with the development of Duolin every step, there are a lot of Guarts who sacrificed and sacrificed for him. Let him realize that he really needs to do something! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only want to live well when I am poor, but when I have more power, I hope everyone will have a good time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
