			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellen put on a brand new dress, and when he went out, he repeatedly asked his girlfriend if he was decent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meeting is very important, at least Blaun is thinking this way. He is a businessman, and the young politicians of this origin are more in the New Party. The capitalists are loyal to sending their outstanding younger generations into politics. Coupled with the influence and support of family wealth, it is much better than supporting other politicians who rely on money to connect with each other. In fact, the politicians who are mainly from the top of the New Party are not loyal to these small capitalists. They are more loyal to the consortium. Cooperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After spending a lot of money, Brenlen got a position as a mayor of the city, even though he knew he could become the mayor’s actual and his own ability. Nothing, just no one is willing to be with Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already killed a mayor, and maybe he can kill a mayor. Even if he doesn't do this, Nano Lindes is not a good place. The fast-recessing economy has turned this into a black hole. Anyone who comes here will become the embellishment of the city of Otis, and will become a mediocre person who sets out Dulin's talents. But the mayor is always the mayor, even a mediocre mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryan’s grandfather told him that even if he could not enter the top of the new party in the next 30 years, his contribution to the family was excellent and superior. Because he will be the first politician in the family to become a mayor, he will be able to play a bigger role when his children, nephews and even grandchildren begin to go to politics. He opened the situation for the family and was definitely a minister of merit. For this reason, his family equity took three more points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was already ten o'clock in the morning when he saw Doolin. He took his second train to Otis from home at six o'clock. In the morning, the bus was a bit slow. He was a little scared because the appointment time was 9:30. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I opened the door, Du Lin looked up at him and immediately stood up. He smiled and greeted him, and reached out. "You are Mayor of Blenheim? Welcome, do you want to take a break?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellen was somewhat flattered with Du Lin’s hand. “No, no, I am I slept in the car for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin invited him to sit down and let Dove send some drinks, waiting for only two people in the room. At the time, Du Lin said: "The city of Otis and the city of Nylondes is very tight. We are brothers. Then you and me should be brothers. Do you think I have a problem?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cup that Blair had just picked up was put back. "No problem, no problem, you are right. Otis and Nano Lindes are brothers, we are brothers."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good!", Doolin nodded with satisfaction. He knew that the young man might have been frightened by what he had done, and that was the fact he wanted to see. He does not want anyone to reach out to his site at any time and without his consent. This is a shameless and mean act, so someone must take the initiative to stand up and let everyone know the consequences of angering themselves. De's success has become a "benchmark" that makes people aware of the seriousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things are always divided into two sides, there are good natural and bad, and the bad name will make Du Lin cause some trouble, but these troubles are not important, in the long In the years, people can only remember things in three years, and things outside of three years may have long since forgotten. Time will solve these problems, even without him having to do anything for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have an idea that the city of Otis is growing faster and faster, and the economy of Nano Lindes has been the first in five years this month. The second serious recession, I think this is unreasonable. A developed regional economy should promote the economic growth of the surrounding areas as much as possible under the premise of satisfying its own economic construction. I have an immature idea...", Dooling glanced at Bren, and Bren, slightly bent and nodded with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The city of Otis has completed most of the construction in my planning. In order to create a distinctive SAR economy, I have abandoned a lot of The traditional economic model. But this also has a huge drawback, that is, the problem of less job. After all the construction period ends, the existing jobs will meet the needs of local families for work, and there will be labor surplus. Wait for a few questions and extensions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I invite you here today to solve this problem. The traditional economy may not be economically built. There is a bright political achievement, but the victory is stable, and winning will generate a large number of jobs to meet the needs of the social work group."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “A casino, I can only get 800 jobs, but a factory can have thousands of jobs. Nano Lindes has lost a new form of economic growth, but it does not mean these traditional economies. It will be ineffective. If we arrange something in Nano Lindes, balancing the social form and economic form on both sides will be of great benefit to you and me. What do you think?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Braun looked at Du Lin's young, calm and hidden face with a sense of brilliance, and there was a very absurd feeling. He feels that he has lived to a pet called Ditai. He has seen Du Lin’s resume. This is a young man who is only 21 years old. But he is thirty, and the gap of nine years makes him face Du Lin’s instead of his grandfather. a feeling of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He realizes that some rumors are not necessarily true, because the ability to do this is not a relationship, it can be piled up by connections and money, which requires a personal Ability, and literacy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His attitude has changed, thinking very seriously about Doolin’s suggestion, and then nodded. “Yes, you are right, take office. I have studied the development plan of the city of Otis before. I have not seen the traditional economic form. For example, some heavy factories and the like, if you can put the traditional economy into the nano Lindes, it is indeed a good one. "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellen said something awkward, "I have been short-lived, but I can’t do anything about the situation of Nano Lindes, you are today. The words suddenly made me understand where the way out of Nano Lindes is. The nano-Lindes has a smooth and developed transportation route, a vast land and a large number of residents. If you change the current economic model, you can really revitalize it from another road. The economy of Nano Lindes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took out a cigarette and handed it over. "So what do we agree on?" Lylen nodded, and Du Lin smiled. I lit a cigarette. "Next, I will discuss several cooperations with you in my personal capacity. It is also my help to the economic construction of my brother city..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At noon, Doolin Light Braun ate a meal. As the chairman of the most luxurious hotel in Otis, Alexander personally made a dish for them and accompanied him. At the dinner table, when I heard that Du Lin intended to invest in several factories in Nano Lindes, Alexander had an inspiration and had an investment intention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched his prominent belly and smiled and asked: "Can I build two factories in the middle of Lindys?" With open arms, the table around the guests is all guests. "There are some foods that can be processed in advance, then shipped here, and some of the hotel's consumables, which can be produced by ourselves."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin immediately made a decision. "I don't think there is any problem with this matter. When the Mayor of Blair is free, you go to Nano Lindes to talk to him." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander is naturally indispensable. He used to use Du Lin as a friend. Now he only has the word "were" for Du Lin, and even his friends can't even think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor who dared to kill the mayor is still an ordinary person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously not! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are Alexander himself an average person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously yes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can ordinary people and ordinary people be friends? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending away the full-fledged Brighton, Du Lin is also very satisfied, as he said, the city of Otis will inevitably appear after the end of the construction period. The number of workers has exceeded the number of jobs. Why is the city hall of any city very concerned about the employment index? Because the unemployed population will bring disorderly turmoil and chaos, because the loss of work without income, the unemployed people who make life more impoverished and embarrassed will gradually become extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who travel to Otis are wealthy people. As long as a case occurs, it will quickly become a social phenomenon. Locals and migrant workers who can't live without it will put their ideas on the wealthy tourists. The first person will be robbed, the second person will appear, and then the law and order will soon fall into chaos. The city of Otis will also face big troubles, no one will be willing to travel to a dangerous city, so this phenomenon must be curbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way is to turn Nano Lindes into a huge factory, let people go to Nano Lindes to make money, and then to the city of Otis. To this end, Du Lin and Blair’s cooperation will also be responsible for building an express train between Nano Lindes and Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of doing so are obvious, the money is ultimately spent in the city of Otis, while maintaining the security problem, extending the problem of this brother city, then the future One day, the city of Otis can annex the Nam Lindes and make Nanonders the "second district" of the city of Otis? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very possible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for what it will look like after leaving, it doesn’t actually look like Du Lin’s imagination, this is his city, nano Lindes had the factory he and his interest group invested in, and had already firmly controlled the two cities and kidnapped the local city hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
