			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scream smashed the silence of the late night in the fifth district, and the constantly lit windows revived the quiet fifth zone of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People came out of their homes in draped clothes and walked up the street, watching a girl lie in a bloody mooring, her companion squatting Aside as stupid, I don’t say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone in the crowd can't stand the curiosity of the first, open Asked a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl looked in the direction of the voice, the stiff muscles on her face changed very quickly, revealing a vivid sad expression, she wow I cried out, my body trembled, and looked helplessly to the people around me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trot from the distance, the old man opened the crowd and walked over to the girl, putting his clothes on the girl. Although it was summer, the violent sea breeze made the street at midnight still a bit cold. He checked the girl's clothes, found no injuries, and glanced at the girl who was no longer convulsed in the pool of blood. The brows were screwed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dim light, he saw a bloody tire print. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Car accident! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Totto's mood has become heavy, there is no doubt that the two girls have suffered a car accident in the process of returning home, and even more heart-rending is the other Already ran away. In fact, even if the other party does not run, they can't take the other party. After all, the people who can drive the car will not be ordinary people, and naturally there will be no ordinary background. He sighed. The best solution for this kind of thing is to find each other, let the other party make a sum of money, and compensate for it. As for wanting the other party to be more severely punished... difficult! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are provisions in the imperial law regarding penalties for driving a car, but sometimes things are different and done differently. In the event of a car accident and the death of a person in accordance with the provisions of the Imperial Law, the owner must accept at least three years of imprisonment as a punishment in addition to paying a sum of money. The problem is that few car owners will actually go to jail, because most of the family members of the deceased have chosen to withdraw their complaints when they face a banknote that they cannot refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Totti patted the girl's shoulder and stood up. He looked at the crowd around him and his eyes swept across their faces. "Who saw the bastard driving?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is talking, although people are very sympathetic to the girl who lost her life, but speaking at this time means that in the future it may be necessary to testify in court. It’s good to go to a rich man, either it’s too good for your own life, or it’s too good for your own life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People closed their mouths in silence until a child stood up, he was only about seven or eight years old, and his eyes were filled with a kind of childlike Justice, "I saw, a blue cabriolet...", his parents rushed out of the crowd without saying it, and dragged them back into the crowd. Because an outsider causes his family to break, no one is so great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, there is one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Totto smiled at the little guy who looked at him through the gap, and he straightened his back and said in a powerful voice," I saw that a blue roadster hit the child and fled. I saw what? Who can remind me of this old guy, my memory is not as good as when I was young.", Totti did touch some people in this way, and gradually some people added a little more detail, including the half bottle of wine they found on the side of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth district is the largest living area in Irian, but there are only two police stations. People living in the fifth district do not like to deal with the police no matter what happens. When something big happens, you may have to go to court. The cost of the lawyer is more than the family budget. They can't afford it. It’s not necessary to find a policeman for small things, because the police can’t handle the small things that are inconspicuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, Totti must call the police, relying on the elders in the neighborhood or the more prestigious people in the fifth district, can't handle this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police on duty just woke up for a while and was awakened by a rush of knocking on the door. He slammed up and pressed his hand The waist is placed on the weapon while observing the surrounding environment. After about three or five seconds, he squinted to the front of the police station and opened the door. He asked impatiently: "You can't be quiet for a while in the middle of the night?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next second, a cold chill came out of his buttocks, rushing up the top of his head along the spine, his body glimpsed and he got a goose bump. He felt his hair erect and his body became stiff. In front of him, in the dim moonlight, at least hundreds of people were crowded outside the police station. They were very quiet, no one made a little bit of noise, so they stood and looked at him straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when he was about to close the door and ask for support, Totti, who was in the first place, took a step forward. "Mr. Police, we have to report the case, In a blue roadster that killed a child in a community, he left a bottle of wine and some pieces of the car."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The policeman was shocked and took the half bottle of wine from Totti. The look on his face changed slightly. He immediately asked Totti to come in. "I think I need to contact the regional police station!" He said so to Mr. Totti. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the wine label on the bottle is called "slut", which is a very strong wine. The price of a bottle is about forty-five to fifty. Between the blocks, this wine often only needs one cup, which is enough to make most women excited by the confusion, so there is such a name. Although the name is not good, it is undeniable that this is definitely one of the top wines from the winery in Juan. It is not that the perpetrators must be Juan or a person who has a relationship with Juan. It is only through this bottle of wine that the perpetrators are very rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of Irian, all the troubles associated with wealthy people are big troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Irian District Police Department quickly dispatched police to investigate the car accident and the sports car and driver that triggered the car accident. This is not a difficult case to detect. Because the entire Irian city has a few blue cabrios, they quickly set their sights on the well-known real estate agent of Irian, Fowlers and his son. Last year, Old Forrest bought a blue roadster for Little Fowlers as a birthday present, and now the car is parked in the repair shop, the front is almost completely ruined, and the bumper is missing a big chunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools is lying on the couch of the mechanic's office and screaming, and when he enters the office, he can smell a strong alcohol. A captain of the police station frowned and retired. This time was not the best time to arrest and interrogate Little Fowlers, so they informed Old Fuller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Fuller is only 50 years old this year, probably because he was too embarrassed when he was young. In this society where every family has three or five children, he only has a child like Xiaofulus, when he knows his own After the child killed a pedestrian, he did not show much concern. "Is my son injured?" He paused for a moment, and his face was soothed. "It’s already very late today, ask. Ask the family of the children who are still running on the road that night, how much they want. If there are too many, let them go to court to sue me and my children. If you have less, you will pay for it. I will arrange for people in two days. Send it in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Old Fuller hangs up. When he just turned around, he saw his wife standing in the robe and stood outside the door. His face looked worried. Old Fowlers shook his head with a smile. "My son is very safe and has no injuries. Don't worry, I will deal with it." Ok."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman breathed a sigh of relief and returned to the luxurious bedroom with Old Forrest, and soon fell into a deep sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police relayed the words of Old Forrest to Totti, and Totti stood up in anger at the time, but soon he sat down again. go back. As the police said, he can actually sue Fowlers and his son, but he and the family of the deceased have no money. If you want to win in court, you must ask a reliable lawyer. In Irian, a lawyer with a good winning percentage is worth 5,000 yuan, they can't afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, like many car accidents, people die and die. It is better to ask for more money to improve the living environment of living people. It is also their last contribution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Totti brought the news back, the mother of the deceased fainted directly on the ground, and her husband lost all reactions like dementia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They compromised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to be uncompromising. They can’t fight Fowlers and their sons. It’s meaningless to accept any other resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what they can't think of is that sometimes it doesn't make sense to accept life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a neighbor’s husband died of work, the factory owner compensated 6,000 pieces and reached 4,500 pieces. They also put forward the requirements in accordance with this standard, five thousand, not more than one point, and can not give one less. After all, it is a human life. It is very mean to use money to measure, so they hope that even if their daughter is dead, the price will not be too "devious." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
