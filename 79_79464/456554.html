			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...slower!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, slow down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay!", Graf patted the truck's compartment, and some enviously looked at the guy from the driver's seat. The young man is already in the middle of his twenties, and he has already started on the truck. It is important to know that Graf’s childhood dream was to become a truck driver for a truck. Every day he is full of goods, happy to be hired on the streets of the city, no one can stop his pace of freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s a pity that he can’t afford a truck until now, and he won’t drive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truck driver called Mellon, the son of Mr. Krien, Mr. Klien took out a small sum of money to buy the truck and then used him. The status and relationship at the station is for short-distance transportation for some cargo owners. I have to say that the reason why the capitalists can become capitalists is indeed not blown out. His eyes are very clear and his sense of smell is very sensitive. In less than a year, the money for buying a car has already been returned, and now he is earning much. In some busy months, Mellon can make more money in a month than his father, and it is much more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the reason why things are rare, after all, trucks are not something that everyone can afford. Most of the people who can afford trucks are capitalists. They are willing to spend a little more money to buy a car, and they are not willing to buy a truck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about transportation? Of course, let the workers carry the transportation, or give them to them every day, give them drinks, and send them money, just to provide them as parents. Of course, let them work! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two thousand and five hundred boxes of wine can not be pulled out at once, this is only the first time, all fellow members came here to help Du Lin Handle and store these drinks. Dooling gave them a decent salary and gave them the courage to stand up, so they had to do something for Doolin, even if they were not happy to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milon leaned against the carriage and looked at the big man around him, patted him with his body hair arm, "Brother, borrow a fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf rolled his eyes and took out a match. He slipped on Mellon's trousers and slammed. Milon covered his match with his hands, took two breaths in his mouth, spit out some smoke and then took it. Taking Graff's hand, the latter left the match on the ground and grinded it with his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said, why should we build a warehouse outside the city? The road is not very good. Is it not too troublesome to ship it in the future?" Myron, who runs the goods in the city, is very strange about Du Lin’s choice. Most of the roads outside the city are stone mud roads. When the weather is fine, it is fine. Once it rains, it is just a life. Moreover, the warehouse rental fee in the city is not very expensive. After all, Ternell is a small city. Now a warehouse of 100 square meters only needs 50 yuan a day, only 15 yuan a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf didn’t know how to answer, and didn’t say anything. After turning a blank eye again, he closed his mouth and stared at the kidkers’ goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because it is almost winter." At this time, another sound came from the other side of the truck, which is the voice of Doolin. He walked to Graf's side and glanced at Graf, who immediately walked with the group of people to the truck and began to carry the goods. "There are three months to go into the winter. These drinks will be destroyed under low temperature storage. Some of these things, I have not read the book, I don't understand it. If it is too cold, it will make some unsatisfactory changes in the taste of these wines."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "So I bought this farm and built a special storage room to make the wine safe for the winter and welcome the carnival of the coming year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp To be honest, Mellon didn't understand, and what changes did not make it clear, the ghost knows what it is. But he still looked like "the original", and as Dolin spoke, he nodded his head, because he had read books, at least he was higher than the people here. So he must show that he is a literate person, not an illiterate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are the roads on the road okay?" Du Lin said after he said that he didn't know what it was. On the shoulders of Mellon, Mellon is not very used to being shot by his little guy, but he is also very clear that this guy is a rich man. He and his father may have many differences in their lives, but they are surprisingly consistent in dealing with the rich, that is, they cannot be offended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myron smoked two cigarettes and threw it on the ground and stood up straight. "The road is not bad, sir, at least not too bumpy, no slippery place, It’s a bit far.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hire Meron to transport the drinks and give him 80%. The price is fair and wins. After all the pulls are about seven to eight, at least five dollars. It is not so easy to earn five yuan this year. The hard work in the station is eighty-nine in a month. Only Graf is so strong that he can exceed ten dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s gaze soon fell on the truck. He touched the truck’s compartment, and the cold metal texture made him feel comfortable. “ How much does it cost for a truck now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five hundred and fifty, and not a one-time investment." Du Lin picked up his hands. Slightly biased, let Mellon continue to say, "For example, repair, at least twice a year, replace some parts or something, add up to about fifteen or so, and there is a crystal. A standard Jingjing can drive this car for 6,000 kilometers, which is thirty-two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will return to such a mileage every day, one month at About 3,000 to 4,000 kilometers, that is to say, on average, basically two dollars for two days, and one hundred yuan for one year. Up and down, there are nearly two hundred pieces that need to be spent on it each year. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, Mellon is obviously a little stunned, originally thought After buying the big guy does not need another hundred and fifty block what it takes, he did not expect to have to eat every year two hundred pieces, but this is also part of his profits from the inside. If he didn't have these expenses, he would have moved out and lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and had a number in his heart. With the high level of wine filling after the distillation, the transportation of this matter should also be on the agenda. It is absolutely impossible to rely on others to transport. As a result, transportation costs account for a small part of the cost. Secondly, transportation with others will inevitably expose some things that cannot be exposed, so he has decided to buy a car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy a car is a big deal for the former Du Lin, the five hundred and fifty trucks are simply sky-high. But for Du Lin today, this is not a big expense. If it is not cost, it is 55 bottles of high-alcohol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car in this world is not the same as the car in the world in his dreams. The car in the world eats something called gasoline, and the world’s The car, eating is twin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
