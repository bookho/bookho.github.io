			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only twenty boxes a month?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss of the Wild Rose Bar frowned When Graf first found out that he wanted to sell a high-quality wine, he was not optimistic. The high-alcohol market has been stable for so many years, and every guest has his own preferences. A new product wants to enter this stable market blindly, and the outcome will not look good. But when Graf poured two small cups for him to taste, he immediately felt that there was a play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wild Rose Bar is positioned in the middle and high end, and the main consumer groups are middle-class families in the city of Tener. These people can't go home drunk and go home every day, but it's ok to buy a cup every three. Among the consumers in this class, consumers are no longer purely consumer goods. They all have their own tastes and styles, and they only consume what they like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two flavors are unique. He tastes immediately after taking a sip, and if there is no accident, he should be able to have a certain market share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he didn’t think was that both the first love and the snow elf were well received, and many men loved their first love, while some young women liked it. Snow elf. In just two days, the six bottles of wine sent were sold short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, some old customers still complain about the bar because they can't drink these two new wines. This is a microcosm, a microcosm of a society, and Mr. Colt, the owner of the Wild Rose Bar, suddenly gave birth to a ambition. Since the new high-quality fruit wine in Tener can open the market, can it open the market in other cities? If it can be proved that this unusually high level of wine can be welcomed elsewhere, why is he not acting as an agent himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-alcohol profit is well known. After all, the phrase "the closer the devil is, the more the pocket is full" has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. As long as the price can be negotiated, even a bottle with a profit of only two dollars is enough to make him a newcomer in the imperial chamber of commerce! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his own news, the entire empire has hundreds of millions of bottles of high-alcohol consumed each year, as long as it accounts for one percent of it, that is, the size of a million bottles. , two dollars per bottle, and two million gross profit a year! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is much more profitable than opening a bar in a rural area like the city of Tenell. More importantly, he can rely on these two kinds of fruit wines to form a product chain with a high level of wine as the core, selling more things to Get more benefits! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Colt was not asleep all night, thinking that he was about to look up and step into the upper class of the Yaoxing Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Graf’s words were like pouring water on his head in the cold winter season. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The output can't keep up, a bar only has 20 boxes a month, that is, 260 bottles, all the pursuits and dreams are soaked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the production not keeping up, or is it a transportation problem?" Mr. Colt ripped the neckline that made him uncomfortable, "I don't ask Are these wines produced by you or from somewhere? I mean, if I support a large amount of development funds, can I get more?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Graf stunned, and if he followed his thoughts, of course it was a good thing. I have obtained a fund for the development of my own business without any reason. Where does this good person go to find it? But the problem is that Du Lin is now the master, and he also knows that his brain is not very useful. Hesitantly shook his head. "I am very sorry, Mr., I need to discuss it with my partner."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Colt has sharply captured the word "partner", which means that Graf is not the principal. He investigated Graf, and Graf has no special skills except that he has a good body and can play very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If enthusiasm is also a special skill, then one should be added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of his enthusiasm and generosity, he has a certain reputation and prestige in the Guarte group in the city of Tener. When the Guartes are in trouble, they will ask for help. He will always accept it. In the previous year, because of a contradiction between a guar trader and a gang, Graf could not take care of the other’s life when he used excessive force. For this reason, he not only lost a sum of money, but also ate for half a year. rice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone did not pay him the compensation and bail him out, maybe he is still in the prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a small character suddenly can produce a high quality wine with such a high quality, which is inevitably impossible to be his own thing, and certainly not the thing of the Guart businessman. After all, if the guy who has a certain position in the city of Tener wants to do a high-alcohol business, there is no need to be so troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So who is his partner? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Colt thought about this issue while looking at Graf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s always said that a fool will step on gold. He didn’t believe it, but he has to believe it now. Once this sale is big, Graf will certainly benefit a lot, it is a lucky guy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Graf was uncomfortably twisted by Mr. Colt, twisting his buttocks, letting the sofa under his ass make an unpleasant sound, Ke Mr. Erte smiled and stood up and said, "Well, first, you go back and ask your partner. If he thinks it is ok, I will provide 10,000 yuan to help you increase production. Of course, I also I hope he can come over and sit down with me and have a good talk. I have a big deal to do with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf quickly stood up and smirked Nodded, just like the big men he saw in the upper class, it was always funny when he made such an action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf was out of the door for less than a minute, and Mr. Colt greeted one of his men. "Go stare at him, don't alarm him, look at him." I have had a long time of contact with someone for a few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving the house, Mr. Colt was deeply immersed in the sofa, his eyes flashing with ambition Rays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one day, Graf smirked with a smile on his face and visited several bars he supplied. Without exception, all bars wanted to eat a lot. Into this newly emerging high-fruit wine, in the words of another world, this high-quality wine fills the gap in the lack of fruit wine in the high-alcohol. This high-alcohol wine has an extremely broad market and sales volume. In addition to some bosses who honestly do bar-selling, there are two people who have the same mind as Mr. Colt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to represent both wines and sell them nationwide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
