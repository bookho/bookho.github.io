			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this happening? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that Brest has never thought of. A strange person snoops on their message and then runs away. He just catches up and lets the other person Go, the guy actually shot, and more than that he broke into the 203, that is Doolin's room. What's wrong with this world, why is there always someone who is embarrassing me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brest knew that the person was exposed when he crashed into 203. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter who is suddenly disturbed, it will definitely be vigilant. According to Brest’s observation room, there are at least three people, or more, plus the inexplicable People, they can completely hide in the inside with the advantage of the terrain. He screamed at the murder, and the sudden inexplicable shooting of the other party had alarmed the people on the street. He could already hear some screams. This guy destroyed all his opportunities and even ruined his future! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the moment the gunshots sounded, it was when the sheriff picked up the phone and asked for assistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the sheriff wants to mobilize police officers from the nearest city to participate in this battle, it will take a long time, he is not worried. He is worried about the sheriffs in the nearby towns, as well as a group of "hunters" who make a reward for the rewards of the overnight rewards. This group of self-satisfied gold diggers exchange their counterparts for money. For them, every colleague is very May be their prey for money. They refused to admit that they were gold diggers and gave them a new title called bounty hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the two smokey guns on the empty corridors and walls, Brest slammed his feet and turned to his companion, "It’s too late, Now, let's go, look for the horse, and other people will follow me...", he took the lead and touched the gun to the corridor outside the 203 door. The door was opened by him. He didn't look at it. He just wants to know how many people are in the room and where they are hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very old-fashioned tactic. It can also be said that the gold digger’s experience of living in the west is always in the process of avoiding bullets. A little voice, you need to adjust the position in time to avoid becoming the enemy's first target to kill, even some people can not see the enemy will involuntarily pull the trigger to counterattack. These sounds and movements can tell people in the corridor, how many people are in the room, and where they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he didn't think of was that he actually hit the man, because his ears screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, Eric’s tenderness of the tender meat on the inside of his thigh almost gave up the strength of feeding, and the pain of the heart had already followed. The neuron spread to the whole body. He felt his body trembled because of this pain. He screamed and screamed with pain in his eyes. "Damn, I am shot, I am shot, help me!", shout After finishing this sentence, he also patted the floor twice, then picked up the already cool colleagues and dragged a distance on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like...someone is really shot, his friend is fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brest looked at the pistol in his hand and couldn’t help but kiss the slightly hot pistol barrel. With this gun, the inside of the room With a little less resistance, their actions are a bit more secure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, suddenly there was a sore tear in the ear, and the companion who was ready to jump on the second floor window was hit by a giant. The force pushed back from the window, and his body twitched down on the floor with a look of horror on his face. His chest was almost smashed, and the tear on his right side was torn open. The naked eye sees the bubble that is constantly expanding and contracting pink is providing oxygen to his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brest looked terrified at the window with nothing, as if something could fly in from the open window in the next second, biting them... .... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin is sitting on the second floor balcony of a residential house not far from here. He has a glass of wine in his hand and a glass of wine in his hand. Gently shaking, the amber liquid swells with fascinating fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the street under his feet, outside the small hotel, a group of soldiers in military uniforms raised their weapons at all the windows of the hotel. They were the army. Party people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin arranged a play, a crime for himself, for Eric, and for the unfortunate colleague to obtain the Empire Hero Medal. And minimize your risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is a very fatal flaw in everything that happens today. This loophole is that these gold diggers may be free-formers and only free-formers. People know that he will come to Wat Xiazhen today. If these gold diggers are caught by the military, in order to survive, they will definitely not retain their account of why they will appear in the town of Washu, why they will target Du Lin, and why they know that Du Lin is coming here today! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these people are going to die, and they must die, but they cannot die in the hands of Doolin. They can only die in the hands of the military. But what if the military is not willing to kill them? Very simple, Eric is in the house! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the script arranges, when a guy tries to jump out of the window and look for horses, the soldiers who have appeared in the town and surrounded the hotel think It was a threatening target, and they shot the guy back in a decisive shot. This also allowed the military to confirm that there were some people in the hotel who had problems. At the request of the commander, the first soldiers began to try to rush into the hotel. At this moment, they did not know which window sounded gunshots. A soldier fell to the ground. It was like a signal flare that started at a fireworks show. The soldiers began shooting at the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let them stop, my people are still in the room!", the vice chairman of the Security Committee looked angry at the commander sent by the military. Since he received the call from Eric, he immediately took a train and took the man and immediately rushed over. On the phone, Eric told the vice chairman of the Security Committee that he found that Du Lin had discussed the construction of the church with the local Guarts in the town of Washu, and he wanted to open a fellowship here. He did not contact anyone else. . But at the same time he had another discovery - they lived next door to a group of free-rising gold diggers, who seemed to be going to rob the town of Wat Xiu to get supplies. This is an intelligence that is more important than what Du Lin met and who said something. Once they can seize the intelligence of these people to dig out the Freedom Front, the Security Council has made great contributions. They can suppress the military department, suppress the military, and even include other internal intelligence and clean up the department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very important thing for the Security Council, which means that next year’s funding can rise by at least 15 points, meaning many people will Promoting officials means that there will be a new batch of vested interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just didn’t expect that when they got here, the military was just outside the town, and the local sheriff was explaining the situation. Therefore, it should have belonged only to the merits of the Security Committee, and it was given to the military. This made the Vice-Chairman always cold-faced. Now he saw this group of bastards who did not care about his people still shooting inside the wooden structure of the hotel, suddenly angered, this is simply murder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander snorted, "Don't worry, I told them, bypass 203!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
