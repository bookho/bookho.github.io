			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chap’s words are very moving. Clark is not a culture with no culture like Chap. He lives in the management of the Securities Club and thinks more than Chap. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't deny that this guy is a bit clever, it's just that this little smart is still using the right place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people fear that precedents appear on themselves and cause themselves to be criticized, but they don’t understand that sometimes the precedent does bring disaster, but sometimes The benefits that can be brought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected benefits, benefits that can't be achieved through hard work! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is done by your own hands, you may need to deal with some pressure, but more is an opportunity. Since the last thing, Clark has been more certain that every risk is accompanied by huge opportunities, huge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is not without precedent, like the woman of Nomi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire is very big, the emperor is very big, but the political circle of the empire is very small, and every day there is something that can be passed to everyone’s ears in the first place. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people who used to work for Nomi菈 may not know, they haven’t even heard of this name, and they don’t even know what’s under the Social Services Department. There is an office where nothing is done, and there is a supreme chief in the office called Nomi. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after Nomi菈 submitted a report on immigration to the cabinet, she became famous, first transferred from the Ministry of Social Services to the Ministry of Justice. Then a new office was set up, followed by the implementation of the Basic Safeguards Law in the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still rumors above that after her current work, a new department will be set up under the Ministry of Social Services, called the Imperial Immigration Bureau. Will be fully responsible for the immigration work of the entire empire, and the job named above will be undertaken by Nomi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current immigration population continues to grow. When she returns to the capital in three or five years, the entire empire may have more than 10 million immigrants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate of these immigrants will be decided by Nomi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a terrible power this is, everyone knows that this line will inevitably become the new big picture, alongside the Imperial Revenue Authority, the Police Investigation Bureau, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people think that Nomi’s huge political encounter comes from her meeting with Doolin through Kevin, which is not a deliberate investigation, in fact There are a lot of people interested, and they don't deliberately hide them. Just check them and you can find them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Clark sees different things, that is the precedent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Nomi has no initiative on immigration issues and does not think about legally filling this gap, there will be no next one. The series changes. It is because she created this “precedent” that she was able to get the next series of opportunities, even to become a new rule for the blank, to become the envy of everyone, Clark is also envious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he also wants to be a person like Nomi, he doesn’t dare to think that he can preside over a big picture, but on the basis of the existing ones, the problem should be further Not big, then filling the gap becomes important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark’s emotions when one thinks that one day someone introduces himself with “This is Mr. Clark who fills a blank in the securities law” as the opening remark It has become a little excited, and people always have a little pursuit, name, profit, or power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bit his teeth and whispered, "It’s not easy to do this. I’m the management of the Securities Club, but you want I know that there are still many people on me. I can't help you pass it directly. You need to get the opinions of several other people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is actually already If you say that you are very red fruit, you are telling Chap that you want to turn things you say into reality, and you need to get through the relationship with others. As for how to get through, let me know how I nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he got into the car and was about to leave, Chap sent Clark to take a picture of the trunk of the Clarke car before leaving. This made Clark look a little. He nodded and said thank you, then drove away. court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning home, Chap rarely parked the car in the garage, like the high-end community he lives in now, there will be two outside each door. Parking on the side of the road. Not everyone is willing to take the car into the garage, not every community is so crowded! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he opened the trunk, even if he claimed to be used to the big scene, he couldn’t help but take a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large travel bag with twenty small denominations of banknotes in the slightly open mouth, all old. He closed the door of the garage and locked it up. There was a fire in the heart that burned more and more. His hand trembled and opened the travel bag, all the money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All are old notes of 20 yuan denomination. He wants to pick up the bag and hide it in the cellar, but finds that he is not moving at all. how much! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Clark’s breathing, which is used to the wind and the waves, has become so fast that perhaps this is the higher reason everyone wants to climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, Chap left the stadium and immediately followed Clark’s list and selected one of the committee’s high-ranking committees. Long as the primary visitor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may not have a high degree of education and has no great work experience, but the social university’s next day’s education system can make people become more traditional than the traditional education system. People are more quickly integrated into this society, and they are more able to understand some special subjects that only social universities can carry out - special communication, that is, gift giving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that Clark’s list will never have someone who can’t communicate. These people will definitely accept his visit very kindly and accept him. The gift, otherwise Clark is just asking for trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, after inquiring about the hobbies of the visitors, he brought some "toys" to visit the big man. According to the data, the great man participated in the Civil War and had a special feeling for war. In his showroom, there were many soldiers, including models of war machinery. He often stays there and spends all day with those toys to remember his past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a nostalgic person. If the old person can't find a "window" that can communicate, it is actually very difficult to communicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Chap also brought his favorite toy, a mechanized company toy made of pure gold, although it is made of pure gold, it is a toy after all. No? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of this meeting was very harmonious, especially after Chap took out his gift, the old man was even more delighted, he even told Chap He always wanted to use these toys to form a mechanical group, but his family did not support him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good sign for Chap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current pay can be exchanged ten times, hundreds of times or more, so the current pay is necessary and worthwhile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the elderly confirmed that they would consider Chap’s request, Chap took the initiative to leave. Although the old man did not expressly support the work of Chap and Clark, considering the word used in such an occasion is equivalent to having told Chap that this matter has passed me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Chap has racked his brains to get through these relationships, the investigation team has arrived in the city of Otis, but unfortunately, during their arrest of Chap In the middle of an empty, Chap is gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapu is not a secret to a few people, but it is a secret to others. He can’t tell every one he knows. People, they have to go to the emperor to get through the relationship, his departure has naturally become a secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the investigation team is not clear. They think that Chap may know that the news has escaped in advance. On the one hand, it reports to the various bureaus and asks them to proceed. Disciplinary review to find out who sold the information to Chap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
