			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Amp looked at the woman, the woman did not give him too much time to observe herself, her voice was very good, if not the horrible half Face, she is definitely a beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello Mr. Ampu, my name is Anna, you don't need to know my position at the moment, I am here to ask you a few questions.", she When I said it, I stopped and looked at Amp calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp smiled twice and then coughed up sharply. He was beaten many times. He suspected that some of his lungs or other organs appeared. problem. Every time you breathe too fast, you will easily cough and sometimes cough up some blood. He coughed for a while, then wiped his mouth and looked at Ms. Anna, who had been waiting quietly for her answer. Her heart gave birth to some good feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that he doesn’t like anyone who likes this ghost now, the other person can have enough patience, and even the expression has not changed, waiting for his own determination, this shows The other person is very educated, which makes him feel very comfortable. He nodded and then coughed a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Ampu, we all know that Du Lin is suspected of a series of criminal acts, but because there is no evidence to get him free from legal sanctions. Instead, you, As the messenger of justice, there is such a end, do you regret it?", Anna’s voice did not waver, her eyes fixed on Amp’s face, trying to catch even a moment. The expression changes, "If you give you a chance to re-select, how would you choose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp is a smart person, never underestimate the smart person His reaction speed and reasoning ability, his eyebrows picked up, his eyes became bigger, and he immediately realized that this was his chance to leave this ghost place. After pondering for a while, he slowly said: "I don't regret my choice. If there is no courage to fight evil in the face of evil, what will happen to this world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; When he said this sentence in a very relaxed tone, the body naturally sat up straight, although doing so would cause a severe pain in his body, but at this moment, The pain of the stock is gone, he feels surrounded by warmth. Although the expression on his face is laughing, it is very sacred, and there is something that makes people feel heart-wrenching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not the last person in the world to pursue justice and justice. The world is full of darkness. There are always people who want to burn themselves as the people behind." Light up to the door of justice. If no one stands up, then I stand up, I will do this streetlight, I will light all the roads. Even if I will become ashes in the end, as long as the people behind me can take a few more steps Going further from the door we are looking forward to, I think that all my actions are meaningful and I will not regret it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone will die. The difference is that after some people die, he only lives on the tombstone, but I will live in the sun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Anna Justice will not die!" When Amp said this sentence, the air in the room seemed to resonate. Every word is so firm, just like his belief. Even in desperation, nothing has been shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first appearance on Anna’s face was some other expression, which made her look awkward. She was silent for a moment and asked: “If you go back What will you do at that critical time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that some words made Amp feel good and his body is not so painful. He thought about it. Said: "Anyone can hardly be perfect in everything. If it is not too urgent for this matter, give me more time, I will definitely find the fatal flaw of Doolin and then destroy him. Like a hard shell, dig out the softest part inside and let him accept his trial!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a very intelligent person, this is me The second very smart person I have ever met, the first person is Kevin. In fact, you may not know much. During that time, I actually had a feeling of enjoying it, but it was a pity that time was too little." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna sent a nod, actually she knows far more than Amp knows And more, AMP did not lose in the end, he lost in the beginning. When he accepted the case, he had already fallen into the trap. On one side is the "victory" at your fingertips, on the other hand, the illusion of a distant future, plus some people continue to attack the empire and the ruling party. The people and public opinion, under the impetus of some people, condemn those officials and the ruling party. These forces are forcing Those people made the decision, the simplest one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very sympathetic to Amp, she has seen all the files, if I give Amp more time, more free space allows him to fully exert his strength, Maybe the ending will not be like this. She glanced at the two prison guards behind Amp. The two left the room silently after a glance, and the rest of them were not qualified to listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Re-introducing myself, my name is Anna, and I am currently affiliated with the Imperial State Police General Directorate, but we do not follow the leadership and command of the General Police. The reverse is that we have the power to direct them. We are a special unit without their own name and place of work. The main task is to search for criminals who may destroy the stability of the empire and cause the loss of the empire, and arrest them and let them They are judged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The empire has given us a lot of power, but it also gives us a lot of restrictions. You don't need to worry about anyone here that you have to close the case in a short time. We have plenty of time, sufficient budget, and sufficient The human hand is for your use and distribution. As long as you can remove all the unstable factors for the empire, all your actions can be accepted. In addition, if you are at work, you can take your extra Time is used to deal with some personal aspects, even if you call the resources of the organization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Amper, are you willing to join us? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp asked, "Why me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not you?" Anna smiled. Her smile was very strange. Half of them were devils and half were humans. She took off the blindfold covering her big half of her face, and Amp almost stood up. Her face is missing, and she can even see some of her tongue at this angle of Amp. It is hard to imagine that Ms. Anna can survive this serious injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be very satisfied with his actions. Anna has played a few eye masks and put them back again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A dozen or twenty years ago, a group of people who claimed to be redeemers organized a terrorist organization called Blood Dawn, who incited slaves and free people to rebel. Against the aristocrats on the territory. Many nobles were killed by them, and many free people and slaves were suppressed. No matter the left or the right, there are people who are constantly bleeding and dying. Their actions have made the empire There was a turmoil that allowed the nobility and the non-nobles to form two opposing positions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't speak for the nobility, nor for non-noble citizens, free people. Talking to the slaves, I am just stating a fact. At least before they appeared, not many people died, the empire is peaceful, there may be some unsatisfactory things, but everyone is at least alive. But after they appear, every month Every week, every day, there are people who die. They think that what they are doing is correct, right, and of course, Mr. Ampu, do you think they are doing right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly went for a moment, her face was a bit confusing, but she quickly returned to God and did not let Amp answer her question. I continued to talk about it. "At that time, my superior assigned me a task, let me find a way to break into this organization, then disintegrate them, let all the bloodshed and death stop. I almost did it, it was worse. So a little bit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you saw it, they left me with scars and shame that will never be erased!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did you ask me why you choose?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I suspect that Du Lin is the descendant of the person I am looking for, this is why!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You can refuse this job, then go back to your cell and wait for what you call the light to light the darkness. You can also accept the job, and then try to bring some changes to the world as much as you can. Mr. Ampu, I I will only come here this time, no second time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp’s reaction is much faster than Anna’s imagination, he immediately replied: “Why refuse If you can illuminate the way forward without igniting yourself, why should you sacrifice fearlessly? Ms. Anna, I promised your invitation!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same day, Anpu quietly disappeared into the prison. The prison claimed that Amp had died and burned because of sudden illness. Dormitory where he lived were quarantined sterilized, which makes prison panic for a while. Some people even took the initiative to attack the prison guards, just to put themselves in an independent cell, and wait for the disease to come out in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter was quickly known to those journalists who were pervasive, and they screamed in the newspapers to attack a series of problems in the Imperial Second Prison, triggering social problems. Hot discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Kevin also knew about it. He sat silent for a while before picking up the phone and dialing a call to Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amp is dead, saying that it is a sudden illness, but the reporters got some materials and said that he might have been killed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was not surprised when he heard the news. A successful prosecutor was put in jail. This may be his only end, "very regrettable." There is one less good man in the world, help me to go to his grave and present a flower, telling him that although we are enemies, but he is a respectable person, all pure people are worthy of respect!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin hung up the phone and walked to the window, looking out the window like a huge construction site, laughing and sighing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
