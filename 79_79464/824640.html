			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside is the hottest time of the year, the rolling heat waves and the air are all picked up, but the house is cool like spring, broken ice in the walls Blocks and ice water continue to carry away the heat from the walls along the copper tube, leaving the entire room full of coolness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a recording hall, the mayor is sitting on the sofa, facing the host with his legs, and from time to time the audience bursts Cheers and applause. It can be seen that the mayor adults enjoy this kind of interview, and the humorous language often makes the host unable to laugh. Half an hour later, when the video's indicator light was terminated, everyone was relieved, including the "actors" who were being trained in professional performance classes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing is good, the key is that your ideas and ideas are very advanced, this is the most important thing of this era!", the assistant of the mayor of the mayor gave He wiped his face with a cold water-washed face towel. He didn't have much heat on his body and it seemed to disappear without a trace. As he and Du Lin went out, he asked: "I think there will be other people who want to promote their own ideas and ideas in this more vivid way. I will introduce some people, no problem. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second episode, each tape can play for 90 minutes, 50 minutes of which is a essay, just now there are so many students Studying at the performing arts school, free labor is not necessary, and I have found two stories written by some screenwriters to give these students hands-on experience. In the other forty minutes, there will be some talk shows, some news like "old news" and about 15 minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue of Doolin only received a cost price, the response was very enthusiastic, and the five thousand tapes that were sent out were all sold out, and some of them even flowed in. Some of the "rental stores" have become the most popular content. So far, there are more than 7,000 users who plan to order three issues, and more than 10,000 users subscribe to the sixth phase. This number is still expanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doolin and the mayor talk about this, the mayor is immediately sensitive to the effect of this thing, far more than the newspaper. This traditional medium is more effective. First, the audience is placed there, can afford it, or can afford to tape, at least the middle class, and these people are the mainstay of the Empire. Second, the freshness of the new media will always exceed the freshness of people's newspapers. Everyone wants to look at it and find out if this new thing has any meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of the purpose of these people, as long as they look at the tape, they will definitely see the front political commentary, which is also expanding the visibility of the interviewees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is conceivable that when Du Lin’s audience is more and more, he is equal to a news mouthpiece that is not weaker than the George family. And more dominant than the George family. The people who buy newspapers are not necessarily middle class, but the ones who can see these programs are necessarily the middle class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle class is more concerned with politics than the bottom of society. The influence of any public opinion is also the most direct to them. Once people realize the value of this thing, it will definitely There are more counterfeiters. But it doesn't matter, Du Lin is one step faster than others, and with his advanced philosophy, the gap will not be shortened, only more and more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After throwing the face towel to the assistant, the mayor lowered his voice. "I have already passed the anger in the party. They have nothing to do with joining the new party." Opposing, by the way, I also found a good place for you." He pushed the door open, and Du Lin went to the aisle outside the recording hall. "In Otis, do you know that place?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin brow slightly wrinkled, Otis is not a bustling city, close to the middle of the empire, about three hundred kilometers south of the capital, a steam locomotive can be a day Emperor. It seems that this place is very close to the emperor and should be very prosperous, but the opposite is true. Here is a poor place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no pillar industry, there is no tourism resources like Ilyan, there is no sea resources like Willis, even better than Tener, Good Tener It is still a transit station at home and abroad, and there is no such thing as a bird or farm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the active operation of this matter, Du Lin knew about the more than 200 cities in the entire empire. The only thing that Otis can make for people to eat is the light industry, but the scale is extremely limited. The long-term lack of economic development has left many locals out of the city. Less than 400,000 people live in the entire city of Otis compared to the big cities with a population of millions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a dead place, without any vigor, throwing yourself there, do you think you are too good to talk? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected changes in Doolin’s eyes, the mayor patted his arm. “I know that Otis is not a good place, but it is also a good one. Place. Next I will seek the position of governor of Cosnas. You only need to stay for four years. After I take office, everything will be fine. And you don’t think that the poorer the place, the more you want to develop. The simpler? There are no big capitalists like giants, and there are no subordinates who are opposed to you and think about more power. There, you are the biggest one!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I really put you to the Royal Park to operate, you think you can be there in a few minutes? Now there's governor is my friend, the appropriate time I will ask him to give you only a certain policy, Turin, opportunities It’s rare, you have to grasp it well. Not everyone is the mayor, many people have been climbing for a lifetime, that is, a mayor!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eyes flash when the adults leave the Houdu Lin watched the mayor shook his head, he looked at the back Lord Mayor; something, go ahead goodbye "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;!! & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp Something special. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; The Lord Mayor returned to the office and locked the door from the inside, he lifted up the phone, after thought, or to his old friend dialed the phone, Because he used a dedicated line, there is no need to consider the problem that the operator is too busy or asleep, and the call is quickly connected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor came to the window with a phone call On the beach, looking at the tourists on the beach, like the gravel, I stopped for a few seconds before saying, "I have already done it. He agrees. He has a very interesting thing, I think you will be interested." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? You are interested, it must be a good thing, talk to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The two said on the phone for almost 30 minutes, the mayor of the city had a phone call. He rubbed his eyes, pushed open the door of the compartment, and lay on the bed. There are some bones in the body that touch the general snoring. He is in his forties and his body function is declining. Sitting for a long time, when I was lying in bed, I felt that the spine was a little uncomfortable. He used a little effort down, hard bed, and after a while the pain was over, it was much more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he invited Du Lin to go to politics, not his own meaning, according to his own meaning, he is not willing to let businessmen enter the field of politics, but Someone sent a message to him and tried to pull Du Lin in. At first, he thought that Du Lin took the money and passed the new party's upper class. Later, he inquired about his political tutor, and then he knew the inside story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp, although it failed, the official also hanged Hodock on the gallows of the Imperial Capital, but also made many people realize that the money is extremely It may be in the hands of Doolin. They can't get the money, but they don't want to watch Du Lin squander the money, or use it elsewhere. Instead of watching him spend money, it is better to put him in and let him spend the money on the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
