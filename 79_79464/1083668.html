			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing a game, Doolin got a very satisfactory score, zero points. He took the non-slip gloves in his hand and pulled out a cigarette. "Director Klein, can you tell me where the biggest resistance is now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The director of Klein, who has just won a game, is very strong. The Social Service Bureau is a thing that needs to be managed in many aspects. From being laid off to re-employment to the appearance of the city, they are very mixed, and the power is not as good as people. As big as I imagined. For example, the laid-off and reemployment sector, the working class will find new employment opportunities through the workers' union, and the non-working class also has its own way of finding employment. Not to mention the middle class, they all have stable jobs, even if they are lost. The work in the hands of the present can easily find a good job as long as they are not dismissed because their mistakes caused the company to cause significant losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid development of society has brought a lot of pressure and vacancies. The market for middle and low-end talents is getting bigger and bigger, and even if someone is looking for from the Social Service Bureau Help, what can they do to corrupt things? How many hundreds of thousands of jobs are available for a job? That is a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At most, that is, to get some money from the management of the city, and to be a little more happy during the election, because there are always some votes used to pull votes. The poster was stuck in the wrong place, which would give the Social Service Bureau a large fine. Of course, there are a lot of unknown things in this very small thing. For example, they should not tear the initiative to tear down the posters. On the one hand, they can't offend those who are participating in the election. On the other hand, they also participate in the election. The consortium behind the selection reached a silent agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They allow posters to appear where they shouldn’t be. Of course, the consortium needs to pay an additional “cleaning fee” every day. As for how much to give, then See how much the Secretary of Klein dared to open. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also some supervisory jobs, such as supervising the construction of workers in some enterprises on the street. It is possible that these constructions involve some work that should not be done. Of course, after a fine, these unruly things became rules and regulations, because they accepted the trigger and remembered this lesson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is a very tired unit. There are many ways to make money, but each one can't get much money and can only make a hard money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the unsuccessful directors of Klein can't afford the members here, and they often come here as a foil. It is even more impossible to beat any player on the court than his superior. The saddest thing is that he is often a position. The lowest one. Therefore, the victory of this game allowed him to find a feeling of exalted, venting the grievances that were always called "smelly sticks". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took some gloves with some disappointment. He knows that it is much more important to make friends with Du Lin than to play a ball. The two naturally move toward Going deeper into the stadium, he said while walking. "First of all, Mr. Doolin needs to let you know that it is not the Social Service Bureau that does not allow your company to continue construction in the artificial setting of the level...", Klein first put himself The responsibility has been shrunk. Recently, Du Lin and the news of the two major banks are paying attention. Many times Maggs does not like these businessmen, but everyone knows that it is the age of Magus, so they can only Then like businessmen. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after Magus left the political arena, and Harry, who is in a team with the consortium of businessmen, is really able to go up, everyone’s attitude needs to change. Even if Harry does not come to power, many businessmen are not likely to be offended by these middle-level officials. For example, some old men in the imperial central bank, who dare to treat them as ordinary businessmen, definitely feel that they are living too It’s chic, I want to make my life harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of Klein’s picking out the problem before he started is that he does not want to let Du Lin think that he is deliberate in order to "make friends" To create such a condition, he is innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and smiled, and Klein continued. "I don't know if you know the Imperial Academy... well, I explain As a matter of fact, we often hear about the new technology products invented by the Imperial Academy. In fact, it cannot be said that it is completely correct. Because these things are only the invention of the Imperial Academy, they cannot represent the entire Imperial Academy, although now people They are all confused. Outside the Academy of Sciences, there are also art institutes. The main work of those masters is to study the past and create the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein felt that his last words were very tactful. He laughed haha ​​and continued. "The thinking of the old artists is still in the imperial period. They think that the emperor itself is a work of art. That is why we have never been there. The imperial capital has carried out new urban planning and renovation, and has continuously expanded the reason for the imperial city circle. They do not want us to change the style of the present imperial capital, and we must completely preserve the emperor’s capital. Come "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;“I don’t like to step on the blackened slate streets every day. It’s the biggest compromise to lay new roads and minor changes to the aristocratic area.” When your company digs the ground, The dean of the Academy of Arts asked me to stop your construction immediately, saying that you are destroying the art of the emperor for hundreds of years, so..." Klein stopped and showed a regretful expression. "I have to Do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought for a while, "I think I figured it out, then how do we let the construction continue?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two started moving forward again. "You have to convince the artists of the Academy of Art to agree to temporarily destroy the face of the emperor and promise to restore it. Only then will they agree to continue construction. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that Secretary Klein has a complete idea?" Du Lin asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gave a very modest click. "I have considered this matter. After all, the Social Service Bureau is to serve the society. We cannot be obsessed with certain stubbornness." Things let the society abandon development, this is anti-trend anti-social thing, you say it is not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The work of Secretary Klein is doing very well, Now our society is lacking such a good official, it is good to find yourself in the perspective of ordinary people, and then find a way to solve the problem, which is very good.", he said that he pressed two fingers into the mouth. A loud whistle, standing in the distance at the rest desk, chatting with Dudu, bragging about himself, what a great president, the scorpion, ran quickly, and he also put a box in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he ran to Doolin, he placed the suitcase flat on his arms, and Doolin opened the box to reveal the contents. Secretary Klein licked his lips, and a stack of fifty old notes was lying neatly in the box. He wanted to touch it, but he finally resisted the impulse in consideration of his identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twelve thousand, are old notes, and this matter, please ask the Secretary of Klein to help me run. I am still very strange to the Imperial Art Institute. I haven’t dealt with it, and I believe that they don’t like young people like me and can only bother you.” Du Lin did not say how much money was given to Secretary Klein, and Klein knew it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he has the ability to do a penny and don’t spend it, then he can put it in his pocket. If he needs to pay, the rest is his, after all, how to choose or to see himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin closed the suitcase and handed it to the director of Klein. The latter’s mouth was closed. The 120,000 was not a small amount. He needed him to work for ten years. Although he may not all be his, now he The motivation is very strong, he will find ways to convince those people. If it doesn't work..., it is not impossible to force construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men shook hands and Du Lin let people send Klein to leave first. He had 120,000 cash in his hand, just in case something went wrong. It will definitely be a big deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking back to the rest table, sitting on the cool chair, taking a sip of the iced juice and asking the throat, Du Lin looked at the Buddha." Have you taken a photo?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Photographed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a temporary solution. The construction of the southern city of Sterling has also begun. The TV station and the city hall there have signed an agreement to provide not less than 2,000 jobs for the city of St. and will keep the tax in Steri. The city, then all the way to the green light, no one will hinder the construction. Irian was almost the same. Du Lin personally made a phone call and talked about it. The matter was settled. The construction method was changed to a staged and progressive construction. There would be no large-scale construction site and some additions. Dust-proof and sound-proof equipment, which hinders construction dust and noise, affects Ilyan's tourism market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In solving this problem, the TV program can be officially launched, first broadcast to three cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the press conference of this project, many letters came from all over the country, hoping to open a TV station in the city where they live. This is a good one. The phenomenon, while the tape market has also produced huge fluctuations. There are still one or two tape companies planning to go public, and now the plan is also lost. An inter-generational product is sufficient to fully combat the tape industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest is the lawsuits, and going to the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought that he was lying on the cool chair with his head, he wanted to squat for a while. At the same time, in the federal parliament, a group of senior government officials are gathering to discuss one thing, with a monetary memorandum of understanding signed with the empire the previous year. This thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
