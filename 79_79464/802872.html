			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Doolin returned home, Carter was sitting in a simple church, and many people had gathered in the church. If you were careful, you could find it. There are only a handful of these people, the others are men and... a dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are people coming?", Carter stood up from the bench in the first row, no one answered his words, but the silence was told He, the people are here. Whether it is really true or not, people are all there. He looked at the two people at the door and told him to "close the door, don't let people come in again" and then walked to the stage. He looked at the silent members and gave birth to a kind of turbulent emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to make his tone seem calm, but he couldn’t do it completely. He closed his eyes and took a while to open. "Everyone... my brothers and sisters! I am gathering you here today because there is one thing I need to explain to you. The president of the fellowship is not me...", the church suddenly remembered a humming sound. He raised his hand and pressed, and these people gradually calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason why they sit here is not to be willing to continue to live in poverty, not to be willing to continue to live like this, to be able to distinguish among many gualts. These people are also thanks to the help of Totti. He has a good prestige among the Guartes. He knows that his children are not "honest" and always love to imagine something that they should not think about. They also know who ever wanted to make some changes, but in the end It was hit by the reality and broke the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Carter proposed to form a fellowship for Du Lin in the fifth district, and to absorb the people, they had a judgment and consciousness. Carter's example is there. He has always had some special thoughts or actions after going through such things. The people who sit here all share the same idea. Compared to the more united northern barbarians, the Guartes are too ununited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the fellowship is an opportunity to unite, they all have their own opinions, and everyone who wants to change and change their lives is not fooled by people. The idiot. They want to listen to it and take a look at what the Carter and Totti’s propaganda will have in the fellowship. They are sitting here and expecting a change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Carter said that he was not the president, the president was 350,000, they did not have much disappointment, and some were amazed and happy. No one knows more about the changes that the rich can bring to them, and the opportunities, and they are quiet again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter patted his cheek and looked at the closed church door again. Several people were patrolling outside the door to keep others from coming. He laughed at himself and then talked about his hidden things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually my wife didn't go as far as I said, because sorrow left here, she died.", the first sentence, let the church Once again, the anger is boiling, and people’s anger continues to remain silent for only a while. Instead of giving up their anger, they chose to press the anger in a small bottle. "I almost died, but in the end he saved me. Then you know the next thing, he is me. I found it fair. I used to be confused. Even the fair things that hang on the mouths of those politicians do not belong to us. So freedom, enthusiasm, wealth, happiness and more beautiful words belong to us?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!", this is not very powerful. He is like a wooden cymbal knocking on a huge drumhead, and the shocking people are shaking. He shook his head and said, "No, no, those are not things that belong to our people. The empire has canceled the rank of the people. They no longer use the people to call us. Does this mean that we are not the people? Of course not, we are still The untouchables, but now it is not only the untouchables, but also a new vocabulary used to describe us, called the poor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what the truth is. I only know one thing, when When you can't change your dignity with your duty, why don't you try to use your fists to let those who humiliate you and humiliate you like you bow your head? I am still alive, not because I have any value, maybe because I don't even have the value of death. But now, I have goals and pursuits, and I have realized something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If life can't change you, then you can change your life." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time the president found me and told me a lot of things. I feel that I have learned a lot from him. Valuable things. We can bow our heads in the face of power and unfair treatment, but we also have another choice, that is, resistance. If you lose your dignity and you are not enough to get what you deserve, let us choose Powdered bones, at least we have won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The president has got some liquor licenses and liquor licenses, he plans to do a very special business. This Business is called in the official statement ! & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp private, but I think this business is called the rise "<br <br /> & nbsp />;Carter's words gradually attracted the attention of more and more members. They tried to slow down their breathing as much as possible. For fear that the heavy breathing would disturb other people and disturb the talking Carter. They feel that there is a wonderful power that is taking root in their bodies and growing rapidly. This wonderful power allows their blood to rush in the blood vessels more quickly, leaving their bodies full of unbelievable power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people clench their fists and look at Carter with a gaze, as if they want to find the truth of the world from what he said! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter shook his head and continued, "This is not business, it is a rise, it is our rise, it is the rise of all the gualts in misery, is The rise of the entire nation!", he waved his fists, his neck earned red, the blue veins rolled, and almost screamed out of this sentence. The unwavering conviction and tenacious determination in the voice made some young people who were easily fluctuating. They stood up and looked at Carter with their fists. They quickly realized that they had lost their actions and sat down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe some people will say that this is not a business, but this is not a business, it is a road to rise and full of bumps and thorns! A bottle of wholesale The wine with a price of less than ten dollars will be sold more than thirty-two bottles. It will be even more expensive. The first batch of wine will provide free compatriots suffering from poverty and injustice in the empire. Mr. President will The future will be put into their hands, and they will be given a sword to protect their happiness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If a nation does not experience cruel battles, it does not experience the pouring of blood, Without baptism of death, we cannot stand on the top of the world. We have surrendered, we have compromised, we bowed to fate, we kneel down to the empire, but what have we exchanged? This road is no longer possible, why? Don't try another way?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Those people, those who fear that we will once again cast the first king and the gods to shine on this world, will do everything possible to stop us. Rise. They will use despicable hands The disgusting power, even threatening us with death, forcing us to surrender to their threat again. We must resist, use blood and death to water the funeral flowers, only if we have the courage to stand up, Qualification to compete for fairness and justice, it is possible to get back the dignity that belongs to us but has been lost by us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One person is not terrible, terrible Even his soul and ambition are also poor. Ten years ago they were still calling us slaves. Ten years later they regarded us as inferiors. I hate this word. I want to throw this word, even for me. Will pay the price of my life, I will never bow again. Do not let fear to dominate your body, find the courage hidden in our body, I want the light of the first king and the gods to shine on my face, even if I will die because of this, and I will also receive the blessings of my ancestors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
