			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Buddha said to Vivian, the prejudice and discrimination of the society against the Guarts limits the race to this empire society. The degree of benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler, as a member of the Chamber of Commerce, has a very high social status and identity, and needs to be cautious in facing this society. In the Chamber of Commerce and outside the Chamber of Commerce, many people are staring at him. As long as he makes mistakes, they will pull him down from that position, and then step on a few feet so that he can never turn over. People don't want to have a race that seems to carry all the negative comments on their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a rumor that in the 30 years or so after the demise of the Guart Kingdom, a guar businessman earned by virtue of his excellent trade ability. A lot of money. If this is an Ogdin, then he may be able to use this first money as a basis, and continue to successfully reap the benefits and become a celebrity in the country's upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not the case. A person who has nothing to do with him goes to the police station to report the case. The ordinary imperial citizen told the police that he suspected the guar. The special person earned the money through some disgraceful means. What is even more ridiculous is that the police actually filed the case and summoned the gult businessman. Under their operation, the gult businessman admitted that he had stolen something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money he earned was fined. He finally slipped in prison because he didn’t wear shoes and hit his head and died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This society is never as good as people think, even today, such things may still happen in some corners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duringlin’s several industries are constantly recruiting people, but the results are minimal. Those who have real skills are not willing to go to companies like him. In the job, I am willing to come to people who want to swindle wages. This is also a difficult problem to solve, so this public opinion war Du Lin throws "discrimination" as a point of view is not purely to counter the people who discredit themselves in public opinion, but indeed hopes to pass such a discussion, Change something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that all the Guarts should thank the New Party and thank Magus for the past and the political philosophy and the municipal concept of the New Party. The discrimination of the Erte ethnic group has been greatly improved. At least people are willing to hire the Guarts to exploit them and give them money. This has been difficult in the past. At that time, if I could work for someone else, if I could have a meal, it would be a very good job to have a little money to supplement my family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most gualts are engaged in agricultural work because the land does not discriminate against them, and they will not let the fruit trees bear fruit because they are gualts, and will not let the wheat have no wheat ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin has a lot of business partners, and if someone is willing to show his closeness, he doesn't mind returning more. People in this world need friends, and every day that needs friendship to support life is fresh and full of sunshine. This is why when Garfield and Alexander did not hesitate to support him, he was able to return more of the benefits of both. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a serious person, a person who is serious about life, himself, and everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natalie’s red fruit came down from the bed, curiously peeping her head out of the lounge, and she saw the back of Du Linjian’s back portrayed in the moonlight. Lines. She was a little lost, and walked over to Doolin and stared at him. "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of smoke came, she realized that Du Lin was smoking. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, thinking about something." Du Lin bounced the ash and looked at some of the construction sites that had not stopped working in the distance, but the thoughts drifted very much. Far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, Kevin is his good friend, very good friend, until now he has not forgotten that Kevin told him before leaving Turner. If you want to read more books and get more knowledge, these things are more important for him than money. Until now, only Kevin had said this to him. No matter what kind of mentality Kevin was at the time, Du Lin had to admit this friendship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only friendship can make people say what you don't want to hear, but it is very important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin was in a car accident, and Buddha told him that Kevin was targeted, and some people wanted to kill Kevin, but these people did not ask for their consent. Although Dudu did not say who is targeting Kevin, Du Lin is not a fool, it must be Vivian's two brothers. In Ordo, Kevin has only a conflict of interest with them. It seems that he won the lawsuit, but he almost lost his life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of Du Lin at this time and the kind of temperament that exudes from the body makes Natalie feel very strange, he is like a change Like a person, standing in the night, bathing in the moonlight, giving a fearful atmosphere, but full of temptation. She didn't know who the call was for Du Lin. She was a bit of a caller because she knew that she didn't occupy a very important position in Doolin's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least she couldn't have let Du Lin put down her hand on the phone, standing at the window and smoking a cigarette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now life is also very good, every day is very fulfilling, you can also find Du Lin when you need it, it seems that this is the most comfortable after your divorce. It’s been a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put out her tongue and licked some dry lips, and the scorpion that was smashed for a long time was a bit dry. She was just about to ask Du Lin if she wanted to drink. When, Du Lin turned and hugged her back to the rest room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than two hours, the phone ringing in the office rang again, and Doolin opened his eyes in the dark, he put his own movements, did not bother to sleep. Natalie, closed the door of the lounge and picked up the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kevin has been rescued, he may need to stay in the hospital for a while, and his thigh bones are folded into three sections, the doctor said that he can be cured However, there may be a little inconvenience when walking in the future...", Buddha did not say the word, this is Vivienne reminding him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to hear good news Du Lin is still very happy, he also has a mood to make a joke, "Are you sure that what you want to express is inconvenience rather than a blind man?" I still know a blind man, but the guy walked a bit early, otherwise they will be able to be good friends." He remembered Amp, and Amp’s leg was interrupted. He also knew it later. In short, it was a A bit pedantic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dedicated his life for his own ideals, Dulin also intended to send him to the federal side, not to turn him into his own It is purely to respect such an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will go see him after three days, arrange for people to protect him, call the president of Cannes, I will see them when I get off!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the afternoon of the second day of Kevin’s accident, he was already awakened. The doctor told Dudu that he should thank the steering wheel for “拽” and lived his leg. Otherwise, if he is not caught by the steering wheel under such impact, it is very likely to hit the head and have more serious consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steering wheel saved Kevin’s life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I should say thank you to the steering wheel?", the pale Kevin is still very weak, but he can see that his mentality is very good, at least he can make fun of himself through self-deprecation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An apple quickly faded the peel between the Buddha’s fingers, and Kevin looked at the Buddha’s hand with some surprise, because the Buddha’s hand did not Fruit knife or something, "How do you cut the skin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palm of the Buddha’s palm is gently covered on the sharpened apple, the next moment the apple is It became eight shifts. He put the apples on the plate and handed them to Vivian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin has just finished the operation. He can’t eat any solid things right now, not even the fruit, he can only eat a little liquid like mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone will give him a different power when he is born, so this is not a surprise." He opened his fingers Turning it back and forth, let Kevin see clearly, there is nothing in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you are, the more curious Kevin is. "If I haven’t been to college, then I really believe what you said, man, tell. Where did you hide things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha laughed twice and didn't tell him that his little secret only Du Lin knew that he had three A very sharp blade is hidden on his wrist, and the blades are as flexible as a part of his body. This is what he learned in prison, where there are a lot of talents, and these blades come from a guy who has a dozen blades in his mouth. That guy should still be in jail now, he is much better inside than outside, a blade can sell dozens of dollars in it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't seem to care about who you are hitting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin’s smile is very Pale, very much in line with his current situation. "Do you still need me to guess? Of course, those guys who have damaged my interests and lost a lot of money." He said with a sigh, "Thousands The loss of 10,000 is indeed enough for them to do crazy things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin also faced some threats during the Royal Capital, such as envelopes with bullets Or something that has been pierced with a red dye on a sharp weapon, it’s still a few million small cases. The amount involved is really too big. Those people can make crazy moves. understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
