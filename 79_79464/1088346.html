			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles have the dignity of the nobility, the pride of the nobility, and it is said that in a book that records some wild history like the ancient times, there was once a despicable public who arranged a Trap, attempting to force the nobility to beg for mercy, thus achieving its ulterior motive. But the nobleman chose to face the death calmly when he was hopeless, he arranged his dress, sat in a chair, and swallowed him bit by bit by the fire. In this process, he did not ask for mercy, even with a smile, it is the dignity of the nobility! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the nobility that is aristocratic, respectable, and horrifying. The nobility is not only a decadent and splendid private life, but also many great characters. These characters have supported this empire and continue to this day. Without them, there is no life for people to live and work today. There is no such stable society! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serving the public? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man reveals a sardonic smile on his face, making the Hill family a shame in the nobility, it is better to destroy the family directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at him, he did not dare to meet Du Lin’s gaze, and his firmness was not like himself. Du Lin took his legs back from the table. He stood up and looked at the man in front of him. He suddenly smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Du Lin reached out and grabbed a bottle of red wine and slammed it on the man’s head. He screamed and slammed his head down to the chair. on. The violent pain made him cry, and the blackness in front of him was black, and the blood ran through a hole that was more than a centimeter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinissa had a violent ups and downs in her chest. She said nothing, did nothing, just closed her eyes. Instead, Diniya behind her clutched Doolin's clothes. She didn't stop Doolin. Du Lin seemed to be able to feel her excited eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like people interrupting me...", he put the bottle back on the table, the bottle was not opened, although there is Some space, but the whole bottle tends to be solid, so it is not broken. Both hands squeezed the sword and shook it. The two hands that clung to his clothes immediately released. He looked at the man with his head bent and asked, "Are you calm down now?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire conference room was silent, and the struggle in the aristocratic family almost never saw blood except the heirs' competition. They like to use their so-called superb means to let their opponents convinced, thus showing their means and ability. A brutal and rude move like Du Lin is simply a shame in the nobility—hey, yes, he is not a nobleman. He is just a mud dog leg from a farmer, so he must be rude, barbaric, and uncivilized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the "gentleman" and "lady" at the table here are a bit more comfortable, as civilized people, angering the barbarians is the most mentally handicapped, they are not Will do that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked up and filled with the luster of resentment like Joe, and he stared at Du Lin. "You are enemies with all nobles. When the things here are advertised, you will have to face the entire aristocratic group!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin reached out and grabbed the bottle and licked the scalp that had been moistened with blood. In the case of gravity striking, the blood splashed again, and even Du Lin's white shirt was stained with a little scarlet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After... two times..., the man has already been in the chair, and Du Lin lifted the bottle again, "Promoting out?", he is a bit gloomy I looked at other people's eyes. "I believe that all the people here are smart people. I also know that I am going to be a "long tongue woman". Am I right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Those who had no position nodded, or bowed their heads and said nothing, Du Lin regained his gaze and looked at the man calmly. "Are you calm down now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The family who had long been dizzy and uplifted was almost completely dark. He was holding his mouth and gasping, and a sense of suffocation was threatening his nerves. He really wants to stand up and face the dead aristocrat in the book, smiling and facing Du Lin's fierce evil, but I don't know why, he can't find even a little bit of courage to face death from his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Answer me!", Du Lin looked at him. "I don't like people interrupting me. I don't like to wait for long thoughts!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sturdy bottle was about to kneel down, Dinesa opened her eyes and looked at Du Lin and said "Enough". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, how cruel this man is to her and her sister, he is their father. She couldn't stand as frightened and excited as her sister and watched her father suffer such a torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at Dinesha and put the bottle back on the table. He nodded and sat back again, then spread his hand with a friendly smile on his face. "Hey, nothing can't be solved." Contradiction, Mr. Joe, are you saying yes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jov, who has already recovered, is still on the table, when Du Lin said his name His body shook a bit. He couldn't imagine that Du Lin was such a ferocious person. Are the newspapers and the reporters who are riding the horses? Is the image of such a cruel person in the newspaper actually a weak person? Is this the horse still weak? This is going to eat people, is it good? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly sat down and sat down straight, his head silent, he didn't want to talk, he didn't know what to say. He did not have the courage to use death to prove that Du Lin did not dare to do anything more excessive for him. He did not have the courage to advocate his own rights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded again. "Very good, I have reached an agreement with Mr. Joe on this matter, then what about you?", he then looked Mr. Homeowner, after a short period of time, he was slightly better. He was not much less fearful than Joe. The eyes filled with complex emotions and looked at Du Lin, and then looked at the daughter who was worried about her, and closed her mouth with her head down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin immediately took out a handkerchief and wiped the blood on the head of the house, a look of concern. "What happened to you? Why not?" Be careful? Be careful when you walk, not every time you can be so lucky!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back at Di Nija, the little girl was scared Exciting, he gestured like a smile, "Isn't your father to treat the wound?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl immediately raised her father, some embarrassing Outside the door. When the door of the conference room was opened and closed, Du Lin smiled and looked at everyone. "I continue my topic. The Hill family will serve me for 20 years from today. The term for serving at the Hill family." Inside, our interests are the same. If someone hurts your interests, it is challenging me. I am actually a very good person, and my friends know that I am a friend who loves to make friends and is very generous. Ensuring your interests, you are loyal and respectful, this is a mutually beneficial thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If anyone feels that they can't accept it, I hope that you can calm down. Talk to me, we may be able to find ways that are acceptable to each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling knows that these people must have other ideas. He doesn't care. All he needs is nominal recognition. If anyone dares to destroy this, he will let these people know how cruel this society is. Every day, so many people are there. Jumping in stress is not unreasonable. There are always things that allow them to take that step without the courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the threat from the nobility group? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s not a problem. In this increasingly commercial society, money is the mainstream of society. As long as both sides can find a balance of interests, who will A noble family of wall grasses and a "Dulin interest group" that is about to undergo qualitative change? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiles, look around the meeting room again, and then let go of his position, "Dinissa, this is your position, from today, you It is the owner of the Hill family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinissa stood up complexly, she was not used to Dulin’s brutal and brutal behavior, but had to say This is the most effective way to solve everything in just ten minutes, but... it's a little hard to accept. She took a deep breath and walked to the position of the owner after a slight salute, and sat down steadily. At this moment, Du Lin found that Dinisha's momentum has changed a lot, and an action has changed her intuitive feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that I am still very young, and I am lacking in all aspects. I am sure that some people will feel uncomfortable. We are a family and are interested. The community, before the outbreak of the problem caused more troublesome conflicts, I hope someone can tell me what I need to improve, what needs me to explain.", her voice is very sweet, not like Du Lin Aggressive, it also gives people a different sense of oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that she listens to every sentence knows what she is saying, but she can find something that is not the same as her literal meaning, and Du Lin also Sitting in the conference room, do not want to open a few skylights on the head, it is best to choose silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since everyone has no more requirements for me, from today I am one of the owners of the Hill family!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin left with the people after the meeting, but also left two young people, one is the new housekeeper of the Hill family. The former butler could not continue to use it. Although the butler in the aristocratic family was only a descendant, his identity was very different. In some families, the status of the housekeeper is second only to the family and the family, which is enough to explain the importance of the housekeeper to a family. This position can't be given to people who are unreliable, otherwise there will be big problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
