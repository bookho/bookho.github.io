			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stayed in Tener for several days. On the afternoon of the fourth day, the celebrities in the city of Tener were received from Mason. Invite and invite them to dinner together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tnelel is not a big city after all, the market is limited, and there is no business celebrity who can name the empire. Even if there is, it will not stay in the special Nair is a small place, so the number is naturally not so much. When Dooling did not leave Turner, the number of people with heads and faces in the world would add up to twenty or thirty. Some of them were like Peter and Godol who had been removed from the wild dogs in the cage. Nothing is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For so many years, the number of upper class in the city has not only increased, but there have been signs of a decrease. The changes in the imperial foreign policy have caused some problems for the pillar industry of Tener, especially after the establishment of the SAR. Some of the trade has begun to move from the foreign special zones, and perhaps some increase in transportation costs. However, various preferential tax-free tax rebates can make more preferential treatment for the import and export of some bulk commodities. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the gradual decline of the private wine industry and other gray industries, the population of remote and backward areas is moving to developed areas, and the city is increasingly prosperous compared to the cities of central and southern China. How much is bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Mason call has some people who want to refuse, but when they heard that Du Lin will also participate, they all said that they are not left. I have time and I hope to participate in such a banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin is a big man who walks out of the city of Tener, and he wants to run for the governor of the west. This is definitely a huge temptation for these people. No one will dislike that their social circle is too broad and their connections are too strong. If you can climb up with Du Lin, you may be able to make a career with the energy of this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Du Lin wrapped up the hotel opposite the City Hall, which used to be a hotel run by the former mayor Peter Mistress, full of people every day, people Everyone knows that Peter's family has some problems. He prefers this mistress and often stays with his mistress for the night. This gives these people some opportunities, even if it is just a normal meal, maybe even a familiar face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman disappeared mysteriously after Peter was assassinated. There is a saying that she left Tern with some money left by Peter. A city in the field has found an honest man to set up a family and live an ordinary life. At that time, there were some gangs who collected clues, not for the woman, for the money in her bank, but unfortunately nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the disappearance of Peter's mistress, the hotel was re-subcontracted to another merchant by the city hall. After re-decoration, the business performance was normal, but it was not too bad. As long as it did not lose money, it could be regarded as a facade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doolin wants to pack this hotel, the hotel manager said that he does not need Du Lin to pay, they are willing to provide free places. When I arrived at Doolin, I was not thinking about how to take advantage of others. I had to consider how to be cheaper than others. He finally gave a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, many luxury cars parked outside the hotel also added a lot to the hotel. Most pedestrians passing by will be curious to look at it. What, it will bring together the great people in the city of Tener, but these people are destined to know everything that happened here today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class is always a cold and ruthless wall, there is no reason to say that the level is not enough is not enough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been about twenty minutes since the dinner started. The people invited by Mason have already arrived. Now Mason and Doolin are not the same. Unremarkable little characters, if these people still have to step on the door to enter, it is to look at Du Lin's face. Everyone knows very well that Du Lin is not a good person. He is a monk. It is the most stupid thing to provoke this kind of person who wants to be a human being. And Du Lin’s current status and identity can’t be slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dinner has not yet begun. When everyone gathers in the lounge, Du Lin appears, and there is a very temperamental woman around him, some The eyes of the human eye moved away and some people looked at the woman with a curious attitude, as if they had seen it somewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ladies and gentlemen, good evening." Du Lin smiled and nodded, and immediately there was someone to join in. He smiled and greeted everyone, some He knows, some people are very strange, he let a little distance and introduce the female partner around him. "I was lucky enough to invite a very special guest to dinner with us this evening. It is my side. Ms. Vivienne."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as he said this, those who did not understand suddenly realized that these people also looked at Mason’s eyes. Some changes. They are very clear about Mason's campaign. They have always had a good relationship with Mason. There is no problem. The problem is that the city is a city within the old party's sphere of influence. Every step has rules. You want to be promoted more and more, it is not impossible, but you must come up with something that will be convincing to everyone, otherwise you must obey the rules of the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old party does not advocate free competition like the new party. The stubborn and decadent system makes every step of everybody follow, but many people like this system because it is competitive under free competition. smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have achieved a few points for promotion, then you can be promoted, you don’t need to compete with other people, no fight for you, give you a chance I work hard, I will be able to achieve the illusion, there will always be people who like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vivienne as the daughter of the last governor, her influence is enough to cover the entire state of Kansas, even higher. The Governor and the Governor are not a concept. In the old society of decay, the Governor means that the military and political powers are grasped. There is not a strong background and background. I don’t even think about this step. This is enough to say that it is the top of the old party. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the old governor was buried, even the old party leader Kubard personally sent a phone call to mourn the memory of the old governor, enough to explain the Governor’s reputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Wei'an is the only descendant of the Governor who is currently left in the world, and is one of the most famous and appealing of the feminist warriors, and The public has expressed that he wants to run for the mayor of Orodo, and even if he does not pay attention to this news, most of the people present have heard of it. At this time, they saw some subtle changes in Mason’s eyes. With the financial support of Doolin and the support of Vivian as the icon of the old party, Mason’s chances of successfully running for a member or mayor would be great. The skyrocketing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original wavers have also begun to weigh the pros and cons, dinner has not been down, some people have become appetite. A huge change in the dominant layer of a city also means that the structure of the entire city is likely to change. If it can't keep up with the rhythm, it will inevitably be eliminated. This is terrible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the inviter of this dinner, Mason and Doolin and Vivian are constantly moving around in the lounge, and are intimate with each invitee. A few words of conversation, a thousand words summed up two sentences, support Mason, support Vivian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the dinner, Du Lin left Mason to greet the celebrities, and he and Vivian found a more intimate place, such as the Delil Art Museum to talk about other thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Vivienne was invited to come to the Mason platform, and Du Lin did not pay for it. Vivienne itself is in a relatively sensitive period. At this time, it is not a good thing to actively create political interference or influence on her participation in the election. This will make people feel that this woman is too strong, not easy to get along with, has not become the mayor of Orodo, began to intervene in some of the work in the city below, will inevitably be artificially created obstacles in the campaign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
