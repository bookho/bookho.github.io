			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won!", a man in a white shirt and picking up his sleeves put all the cards in his hand on the table, then smiled and put them on the table. All the chips are in the arms, he won one hundred and fifty-five in the recent hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Empire has gone through several discussions in the process of borrowing from the theocracy, and finally left a clause on gambling. But in fact, this clause really limits the kind of open gambling. For a few people to find a hidden private place to play cards in private, there is not much to do with a little bit of winning or losing. No one will take the initiative to report himself or report the person who participated in the gambling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A less well-known sociologist believes that "hate is in the midst of a spurt", and no one will report his own affairs without any embarrassment. Neighbors unless you let his interests suffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt frowned and forced the cards in his hand to fall on the table. For this kind of temperament, everyone has long been accustomed to it. His sleeves have also been rolled up, with a cup of iced cubes pouring less than two ounces of wine into his mouth and a cigarette on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has lost an afternoon, as a qualified gambler, he feels that he will be able to win the previous loss, so he is still Sitting at the gambling table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman sitting across from him glanced at the chip box in front of Walter and looked back at the young man sitting on a sofa looking at the tape, young man Immediately stood up and walked to the box where the chips were placed, and took out two hundred chips of different denominations and sent them to Walter. "The third box, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Walter took some troubles from the young man's hands, took out the chips in the chip box left in front of him, and replaced it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom note of the game is two dollars. Although there are rules for the maximum of 50 caps per game, sometimes there are more people who will not say anything. In particular, a "friend" who lost a lot of money like Walter always gave him a chance to avenge himself. He took a few cigarettes and watched the next home being shuffled. He stood up and said, "I went to wash my face" and put the belt into the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One afternoon, he lost the five hundred pieces he had brought, and he still owed six hundred pieces. The huge loss made him feel a little uncomfortable. . Since he had smashed two thousand pieces at a time, his luck seemed to run out. In the past six months, he has won more and more losses. He rarely asks the person who organizes the gambling bureau how much he owes. He is somewhat afraid that it will be a huge number. But I have to say that his friend is not bad. Not only did he organize such a gambling game for free, but the money he owed has not urged him to pay his debts. Instead, he will lend him money if he needs it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in this impetuous city, there are not many such good people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photographed the cheeks that were wet with cold water, looking at the eyes in the mirror, he smiled self-deprecatingly, then waved his fist to himself Cheer up, I have to win today! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The card has been washed when he returns to the table. His next home, a gentleman in his thirties asked him to check the card. He smiled and shook. Shaking his head, "We are all friends, no need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he said this, but his next gentleman is still in front of his face, the card I washed it again, and everyone at the table was smoking, giving me a feeling of smog. His eyes were fixed on the flipping poker until it was completely washed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people play cards more elegantly, to calculate scores, add a way to relax, they play most of the time more skillful, right Calculations and psychological requirements are better. But there is also a kind of game. Just like the game that Mr. Walter participated in, the method of playing is relatively simple. Use the hand of each person to match the billboard on the desktop to compare the size, easy to understand, even if no one can Learn very quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game has multiple stages, which is the stage where everyone bets or chooses to give up. There are only two antes, but many times when it is decided to win or lose, on the desktop. There are often dozens of hundreds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Walter throws the lowest stakes on the table as an ante, then the winner of the previous round begins to "labor", a card deal In the hands of the various participants, Walter looked at the hand in his hand and breathed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good hand. If he is almost the biggest from the perspective of his hand, he will feel this when he sees the public card. The game won! The chances of such a big card appearing are very small. Sometimes a game may only appear two or three times in seven or eight hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tightened his face and made himself look like he had a bad hand and even frowned. Instead, the gentleman sitting across from him, smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, beautiful sort, my luck is good." He doesn't seem to care that he has exposed the size of his card, Mr. Walter. He lifted his eyes and glanced at him, and squeezed a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and said, "Then we can completely lose the card because you won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite person seems to think so, he agrees He nodded and said, "Maybe this is the best choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whit quietly threw a five-dollar chip on the table. He really believed when he first came into contact with such a game, but several times he found that someone else actually had no good cards at all. He was completely swindling him, and he stupidly stuffed the biggest card in the game into the pile. Since then, he has gradually understood that sometimes the winning game is not on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you heard anything similar? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the decision to win is outside the court, which illustrates the same truth, indirectly reflecting the fact that the essence of society is like this, and the jokes do the truth of the world. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that Mr. Walter does not believe...", the person who just won shook his head, and he also lost a chip, "I don't believe it." The cards in my hand are not bad, maybe I am bigger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite player laughed again, he picked up a ten dollars directly The chips were thrown on the table. "We all think that our cards are better. Why don't we make us more fun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next in the suspension bets In the process, every player puts 80 chips on the gambling table. It seems that everyone feels that they are getting the biggest card. When the last card was put down, Mr. Walter breathed a sigh of relief. The board in his hand is very big. If there is no accident, he should win this game. As a winner, in addition to his money on the desktop, there are two hundred and forty pieces, one will lose the loss just lost, there are many. This makes him very happy, and winning money always seems to be a happy thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The player sitting opposite him became severely sighed. He sighed and put the card in his hand. It was indeed a good hand. I can definitely win, but this time I can't! The person who won his money also put the card down, and the card in the hand of Mr. Walter was bigger than the one in the hand. When he opened his arm and prepared to take the chip back, Mr. Walter put his own The card is placed on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His biggest, he took a cigarette and lit the fire, laughing and said, "Thank you for your help, I am not fast enough to sort out the chips. "When he reached out to grab the chips, his opponent's player, the guy who didn't say a word in this round put the card down, Mr. Walter glanced at him, and the hand that took the chip was stiff." Out of the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gambling is a normal thing to lose and win, this is Mr. Walter It has long been clear, but today he lost again. The five hundred yuan plus the five chips this time is one thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thousand and five hundred pieces were clean, sitting in the car, he slammed the steering wheel hard, and the car made a harsh whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on the balcony, watching Mr. Walter drive away, the three men sat down and the gentleman who organized the game was taken out of his pocket. Four hundred pieces were given to the other two players. "This is what you deserve. Don't make mistakes. Don't forget to come over on time on Wednesday." The two men nodded and took the money and left. The gentleman who organized the card glanced at the clock and said: "Call to our friends and start the next game in fifteen minutes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Walter, who drove back home, sighed when he parked in the garage. He put on his clothes and made himself smile. After he didn't seem to have such a heavy heart, he took the key and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Walt?", he just entered the door and heard the gentle voice of his wife in the living room, which made him feel guilty, inexplicable The heart is even more annoyed, not just because of losing money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took off his shoes, responded, changed his shoes and walked into the living room, staring blankly at his wife’s back to him and packing up some small ornaments. , like photo frames and souvenirs sent by others in the past years or bought by yourself. The last time this happened was when they moved here, did they have to move again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked over to his wife and watched her play with these things and couldn’t help but ask, "What is wrong with this? Don't you like them?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her wife did not look back, still carefully packing these things, replied with a slight smile, "I changed a new job, to leave Steri, we May go to the north or the west."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?", Walter suddenly heard the news a bit unacceptable. "Is it not good here? Or say They want to send you away?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
