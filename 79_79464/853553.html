			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My heart is a bit unreliable." Dalanmei was lying on the bed with her elbows licking her husband's lower back. She was a little insomnia, even if she had just done it. vigorous exercise. It was her husband, who was already asleep at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no lighting in the room, lighting requires money, whether it is oil or lighting, for one second, you need to pay cash for that second light. So in the night of the city of Otis, especially after nine o'clock, basically no lights are visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her husband twisted his upper body and muttered a few words, "What do you want to do without sleeping?", he was tired when he was working. Although he is happy with this matter. The only thing he wants to do at this moment is to have a good night's sleep. Tomorrow morning, he will continue to deal with the staff of the city hall who advised them to move, and then went to see the mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but then again, the new mayor would have enjoyed it, the woman named Natalie would have a taste, if it could A woman who is pressed like this is worth it if she is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, don't you really worry?", Dalanmei's mood is ups and downs, she always feels like using the way of not moving to the city hall and Developers are a stupid act. They are just ordinary citizens. They don't have much money, they don't have a strong relationship, and they don't know a few big people. Such ordinary citizens go to the city hall to go against the developers, how many good endings? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her husband was a little annoyed by her, couldn’t help but say: "So how can a big mayor treat us? We didn’t steal it. Grabbing, just not willing to move, can he grab us and go to jail?", he said he couldn’t help but sneer twice. "I heard that the city hall received a lot of money recently. They issue licenses to smugglers. Each license requires a lot of money. Our requirements are not excessive. Why can't we satisfy us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't think So much, sleep first, tomorrow we will know the result."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s move did not take anyone, basically the entire city of Otis knew him. For those who smuggle smugglers and charge high taxes, some people think that it doesn't matter if they do this harmlessly. Some people think that it is wrong for him to do so. However, the small people’s small ideas may not necessarily let Du Lin know that they will discuss them, and the days will still go through as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just this demolition. Some people are staring at those taxes and they are a bit jealous. They can’t help but want to divide them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for this family is not too much, one square and thirty, according to the head count, three times more than other people's demolition costs. The number of people who are unwilling to relocate will add up to less than 100,000 yuan. Compared with every steam locomotive, it will leave two to three thousand yuan, and the tax of three or five thousand yuan is really nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the problem is that this is the city of Otis, the acting mayor is Doolin, and Du Lin is a very particular person. He is willing to obey the higher rules when he is not threatened, and he also hopes that everyone can follow the rules he has set. When someone makes a foul after his rules are made, it is definitely not acceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More, now that he is not just a rich man, he is still a mayor, and if he sets his own rules, he can take the initiative to destroy it. Who will listen to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Du Lin frowned and hanged the phone. The call came from the governor’s office in the capital, and the governor of Harry was in a meeting, so it was communicated by others. Governor Harry’s opinion. Next month, just a week later, there will be a hearing in the Imperial City. The content of the hearing is about the nature of the contraband. Du Lin’s taxation of contraband and the issuance of tax certificates have caused dissent by some cities and departments, which they believe is a violation of the will of the Magus leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, with the support of Governor Harry, these contraband goods were transported to various places, causing extremely bad effects on the localities. Therefore, these people instigated the Imperial Capital Department and will hold a hearing to ask Du Lin to attend the briefing and finally determine whether his actions are legal and can be used elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not good news, but it is also expected by Doolin. The transportation of the contraband method and the guarantee of the safe transportation of these things have touched the red line. Of course, this is actually not a particularly bad news. He thought that the imperial judicial department or the justice would tell him to stop the current move, or that the Magus leader would let him tell him to terminate the current "business." However, he did not expect that the ushered in was actually a hearing. This shows that the attitude within the New Party seems to be very embarrassing. As long as it is not a one-size-fits-all approach, there is always a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a cigarette and walked to the edge of the window. Just preparing to smoke one, he saw a group of people blocking outside the gate of the city hall, which made him A little annoyed. He immediately picked up the phone and connected Natalie through the internal system. Only then did he know that the consultations that should have been arranged in the conference room were suddenly rejected by the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 20 households who were unwilling to relocate appeared outside the city hall. The plan was to communicate in the conference room in the city hall. I don’t know who brought the households in tandem. Outside the hall, they were given a statement in front of everyone, and they were not willing to negotiate in the city hall. Regardless of the purpose of the person, this behavior itself makes Du Lin very disgusted, so when he appeared outside the gate of the city hall, his face was not so good-looking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After glanced at the crowd around the crowd, Du Lin swept over the faces of those people in front of him. He shook his head slightly. "I don't know why you must be with me." Negotiation, I also know why you are not willing to relocate. What I want to say is that there is no room for negotiation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind Du Lin Natalie, who came out, was a little dumbfounded, and then she panicked. If these tough people are noisy, it is a troublesome thing. What's more, she also noticed a detail. Behind these people, there are still reporters who don't exist in the city of Otis. Maybe someone is planning a plot behind the scenes. Once Du Lin and the group have clashes, no matter who wins or loses, this will become a scandal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scandal is always the most feared thing for politicians, because the harm of this gadget can be big or small, the key is how to use it, when to use it. If one day, Du Lin would run for the governor or even a higher party cadre, the scandal broke out enough to make him lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mayor does not mean this...", looking at the hard-to-find eyes that became fierce, Natalie immediately stopped in Doolin. In the face of what I wanted to explain, in the next second, Du Lin pressed her hand on her shoulder and pushed her aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was staring at Du Lin’s walk to a place less than three meters from the crowd, and even the two sides only needed to take a step forward to meet each other. Lin’s face is still the look of calmness. He looked at the people like a little lamb who was not obedient in the sheepfold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I came to the city of Otis, it was actually less than a month. The desolate place is like the desert in the west. The car is invisible." This sentence did not lie. Many onlookers nodded in agreement. He snorted and said: "But look at the present, there are not only many cars on the street, the whole city. Good changes have already begun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
