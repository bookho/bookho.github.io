			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very beautiful!", Doolin praised the heartfelt praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya is standing in front of the mirror with a smoked red face. The face in the mirror is ruddy, I don’t know if it’s the brilliance of the ruby ​​necklace, or because of other s reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other reasons may be more. She remembers that Du Lin was standing behind her and wearing a necklace for her. She was somewhat uncomfortable and wanted to escape, but she was du Lin firmly held her waist, which made her somewhat embarrassed, and there is also an inexplicable thing that is quietly growing and spreading. She could feel that with Du Lin's breathing, a hot air rushed behind her neck. During the process of helping her wear a necklace, the touch between the skin accelerated her heartbeat and her mouth was dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Necklaces, earrings, bracelets and even rings, there was an illusion in front of her eyes, and the man who put his head down on his head exudes endless charm. . She held back, bowed her head and forced herself to calm down, but he was provoked by his chin and praised him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze greeted Du Lin’s eyes from the mirror, and the subconscious immediately avoided it. He responded twice, and his heart was a little panic, and his heart was a little trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows what it feels like, but she doesn't want to face it and wants to avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the butler knocked on the door and let her breathe a sigh of relief. When Du Lin went out, she seriously looked at herself in the mirror, although she had already In her teens, she can't see how many traces of the years have left on her. These years, I have enough wealth to maintain my body, so that she looks only 30 years old, and may even be younger. She would not admit that her temperament is unique, but she also understands what she is emitting, and even some of her colleagues sometimes secretly look at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to sneer at those people, just some little guys who are not sensible, but in the face of Doolin’s calm but very deep eyes, as if all sights can Was swallowed by his eyes, she could not extricate herself after watching for a long time. She sighed, and she could only blame herself for being born earlier. Du Linsheng was late, and wanted to make a poem... but not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, Du Lin came back from the outside, and she took back the scattered thoughts and cheered up and looked at Du Lin. Du Lin’s expression was a bit heavy, which made her In my heart, the slender fingers couldn’t help but sneak into fists and slowly loosen them. “What’s wrong?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's sit down and say." Du Lin went down to the bar and poured two glasses of wine and gave Natiya a cup. "You may need to take a drink first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This sentence made Natiya realize that the problem is already on her own. She took a sip of wine as requested by Du Lin, and then looked at Du Lin with uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how to speak, because it is cruel." In fact, this sentence is the opening remark, and made enough preparations for Natiya to be psychologically prepared. At the same time, she also gave her some speculation, close to the speculation that she was thinking. "The people on the emperor's side just called and told me that Melissa asked them for help..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If I haven't finished talking about one of Natiya's hands, I grabbed Doolin's wrist, and my face showed a look of horror and sorrow, and said a word softly, no! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin patted her back. "Listen to me, my people are gone, Melissa is very good, she has some redness except her face." Everything is fine. They told me a message, I am not sure if I should tell you now, or tell you when you go back. This is your business. For your family, you have the right to make your own choices. If you want to know now, I will tell you, if you want to go back, I will arrange everything for you tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natiya After a large mouthful of mouthfuls of a large number of two ounces of wine, she took a deep breath and sighed in the chest, watching Du Lin, said, "Tell me, I want to know now!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These things may not be so friendly, about your husband. Not long after we left the emperor, he began to meet with some owners in the Oak Bay villa area to play cards..." When Du Lin said that, Natiya interrupted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He swears that he will not gamble again, he lied to me!", she hates iron, she can forgive Walter's previous mistakes. Everyone has the right to make mistakes, but he should not deceive himself. He should not violate the oath. She asked very uncomfortably, "How much money did he owe this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head. "No, he didn't lose, he won the money, but...the next words may hurt you even more, you have to be mentally prepared.", Natiya nodded. After that, Du Lin continued, "He may have fallen in love with a woman who played cards with him and brought the woman back to the villa. Melissa returned home after a holiday and wanted to surprise Walter, but she saw it. ......", Doolin shrugged. "You know, then they quarrel. In the process, Walter slaps Melissa."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
