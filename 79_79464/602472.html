			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood saw the balloon, and I heard people say the metaphor, saying that when someone is dying, it’s like a balloon that has broken a hole. Will leak light. He thinks this metaphor is not quite right. To be more imaged, a person is like a bag full of wheat kernels. If it is fatally hurt, it is like tearing a small mouth on the bag. Mai Ren will be sprinkled out of the bag, very slow and fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand has been a little trembling, like losing the bag of wheat kernel filling, it is no longer full. He pressed one hand on his stomach, and a stream of hot air sprang in his palm. He opened his hand and glanced at it, his glare red. He took a step or two and hugged the lamppost in front of him. The bright red palm print left a trace of twists and turns on the gray lamppost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, my God, what's wrong with you?", a woman in a blue dress with a bright yellow sunhat stood on her mouth In front of Wood not far away, she screamed. "Come on, someone is hurt!", and soon there will be many people of all kinds, some of them have roadsides. The undressed tramp, there are also successful people in suits and suits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are either curious, satisfying, or pleasantly focused on Wood, but no one stands up and tells Wood what to do. Or help this poor guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more blood is flowing, the weaker the body is. The weak legs are constantly licking the ground and want to keep their last trace of body, but the muscles are already In the case of severe blood loss, do not listen. He slid down the pillars and fell to the ground. Blood also poured from his mouth. His body twitched slightly, and there was a burst of exclamation in the surrounding crowd. The strict formation became somewhat scattered. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of convulsions is more and more frequent, and the interval between exclamations is getting shorter and shorter. That is the feedback of the body's refinement signal after the central processing. The complex changes in the series, but the stomach was smashed and the muscle tissue of the wound cut was shattered, and all the feedback was just useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels cold and feels the line of sight becomes a little fuzzy and dim, like the children were born, the red fruit came to this world , cold, and helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young boy stood in the crowd and looked at the body that Wood had stopped pulling out, and lowered the hat, and the onlookers who had not seen the excitement and disappeared into the pulse of the city disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wood is dead, the onlookers send out a sigh that seems to be mixed with satisfaction and then quickly dissipate, leaving only a street tycoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wood has died, the news spread throughout the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gothol was forced to jump off the building, he had to choose to use death to keep secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of a person accompanied by the departure of these two great men began to spread in the upper class, his name is Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything has a clear goal, maybe this goal is confusing, but the person performing it will never make a mistake. Therefore, some characters will never waste their time observing and examining the artificial illusion, but crossing this layer of false cover to see the true key – the beneficiary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned in the above sentence, all planned behaviors, of course, include some unconscious behaviors, from the individual’s own demands, to themselves. advantageous. Wood is dead, and Codor is dead, so who has an absolute advantage in these two things? Is it the player of Godor? Is Wood's men? Or is it a tycoon or a boss? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beneficiary’s name is Doolin, a name that was common a month ago, but has been remembered a month later, Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped on Wood’s body and climbed to the pinnacle of life, and he only did it in less than a month. In this month, he has done what many people can do with a little while. But now he still lacks a key identity, a key key, otherwise it is difficult for him to integrate into a higher society - position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is not to say his profession, not his attitude, but his political position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Party? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the old party? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is watching him, waiting for him to make the final decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are businessmen!", Du Lin slammed the table with his knuckles and returned to the newly renovated corner store, everyone They are very excited. They include members of the Association, and members of the trading company re-titled "Oriental Star". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Doolin went to a slum, the Guarts have a legend that may seem to be a joke to outsiders. This legend was originally circulated among the old queer women, and finally spread gradually, and it was gradually accepted by people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The resurrection of King Adelrero", this is the core content of this legend, the old woman made up an Ode with sufficient life experience and experience. The story of King Lero's resurrection and continuing to fight. In the story, King Odello returns from the world of the dead, tearing up the decaying curtain and creating a new world. All the Guarts live happily in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This story is in metaphor for Du Lin, at least Doolin feels this way, especially when he first heard of this story. But he smiled at it, at least it would not damage his prestige and his status in the Guar, isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the promotion of the legend, many people think that it is a good way to work with Du Lin. If it is not for Doolin, please do not absorb as much as possible. The guar, I am afraid that there are not so many people in the house at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These young people’s faces are full of excitement and pilgrimage, Wood is dead, and Codor is dead, threatening the threat of Doolin. They have been leveled, and nothing can stop the rise of Doolin. They are proud, excited, and full of energy as one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I must reiterate that we are businessmen, not gangs, not those who are violent, we are law-abiding citizens, and are legitimate citizens of the Yaoxing Empire!" After a few steps back and forth, Du Lin said again, "Our happiness should not be built on people's fears. Fear will only bring resistance and destruction, but respect can make us last. My father, an old-fashioned The old guy, he told me about tips on how to make yourself respected by others. Today I will share this trick with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
