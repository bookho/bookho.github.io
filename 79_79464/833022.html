			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about half an hour, the phone ringing on Doolin’s desk rang again. He rubbed his wrist, put the pen in his hand down, and looked at the whole page with only the text he could understand, very satisfied. This time he did not use Chinese characters to record, but used the text of the world. As for why no one can understand it... it may be that his font style is relatively high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called, he went to the window and pushed open the window and ordered a cigarette for himself. "This is the office of the Mayor of Otis."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then heard a strange voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mayor Dooling, I am Harry." He said that he reiterated and explained again, "I am Governor Harry, this is us." The first time I called."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, hello, very happy to communicate with you on the phone, don't know what you need to tell me. Did you do that?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry laughed, his voice was very friendly, at least let Du Lin feel no aggressive attitude,” Mayor Doolin, Let me just say, Mr. Horston just called me and explained the recent situation on your side. In fact, I also know some news about you from other channels. Now I want to hear from you. The opinion of the matter, then convinced me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Du Lin came to Otis to understand the people around here, naturally including his head boss , Governor of Harry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry Wedson, this is the most simplified name after removing a series of numerous titles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry is a nobleman. Before he changed his position, he just inherited the title of the count from his grandfather's hand, and then joined the new party's camp with unrequited secrets. And at the crucial moment, he gave the royal family and the old nobles a knife. Since then he has played a very important role, and his prestige within the party is also very high. This is a young party within the New Party with a certain forward-looking vision and executive power, even though he is forty-four years old. There is a rumor that Harry will be one of the strong competitive players of the next New Party leader. Many people are very optimistic about him, and there are rumors that behind Harry there is the support of the Northern Empire Foundation, which privately admits to the next Leaders within the party are bound to win! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of capital and the power of politics are always such a "no suspicion." Many of the old capital forces are old aristocrats. They don't care about Harry's betrayal of them. They only care if they put a note. How much can you get back on Harry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry is a very reasonable person, maybe just superficially sensible, the politician is always a perfect creature, as for the gorgeous surface. What is underneath, it is hard to say. Of course, no politician will perfect himself. Perfection means great ambition and conspiracy. This will cause distrust, so Harry also has shortcomings, a very obvious shortcoming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes women, he has his own family, but still likes women and there is no one or even rebukes him because his wife died of bleeding during production. In the delivery room. Since then, Harry has not married his wife and children, and has expressed his love for his deceased wife to the public, while looking for a woman to warm his heart. Although these women were eventually escaping the result of marriage by Harry using "cannot convince herself to fall in love with his wife," the overall news and arguments are relatively positive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very interesting, seemingly contradictory and practically useful governor. He is absolutely not as simple as he is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the question of Governor Harry, Du Lin directly told him the answer - the SAR. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the SAR is the first thought after Doolin came to Otis. There is no resource here. If he can't change it, it will be changed here. He didn't want to climb up, he didn't want to be the top three in the party one day. He just wanted to play a little bit of new things after he got a political capital. That's all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doolin proposed the word SAR, Governor Harry came to the interest, he thought that Du Lin would cry to him that Otis had nothing, so he Only came up with such a ghost approach. Then he may ask for it, for example, he stopped what he is doing now, but the state needs to give him some policy support, or transfer him to other places, but did not think that Du Lin actually has one The whole set of plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this word that has aroused Harry’s curiosity. He is a young man himself, so he is very curious about some fresh things and accepts his ability. Very strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Du Lin's description, Otis has a lot of elements that people noticed but did not pay attention to. The first point is that the heart of the empire is only two to three hours from the Otis to the emperor. Secondly, it is very backward and poor, but it is precisely because of backwardness and poverty that it will not encounter any resistance to future urban planning. Third, Du Lin believes that in the next two decades, the economy of the empire will develop rapidly, people need more spiritual enjoyment, and the prohibition of bans, including bans, is no longer appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is still far from being able to cancel, it should be appropriately relaxed in some places, and citizens should not always be raised as sheep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By relaxing these policies to absorb a large amount of funds for the development of cities and states, so as to drive the economic construction of the surrounding areas and the entire state. With more taxes in the hands of the governor, he can turn more ideas into facts, and this kind of clear and executive policy is more popular with voters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like someone saying that you want to build a public toilet, but it has not been built for eight years. Will people still believe him? If he can build a public toilet after he has finished speaking, no matter how much taxpayer’s money is used in the public toilet, and whether the public toilet can have positive effects and actual effects, at least he can talk. People are also willing to believe in him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politics also need to talk about performance, performance is economic and cultural construction, and the impression in the minds of citizens. Well done, the natural performance is excellent, and there are further possibilities. If you don't do well, you will be punished. After all, it is impossible for a party to use these officials who corrupt the image of the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Du Lin’s description, it will become a new paradise and a golden cave, and it will also drive the surrounding economic effects, especially Du Lin said. It is clear that the Governor of Harry is more interested than before when he plans to dig the two mountains on both sides of the east and west, turning the natural danger into a smooth road and speeding up the construction of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the idea, or skill, of Doolin’s conversation. Give you political achievements, don't care? Yes, then give benefits! The excavation of the two mountains was a huge project during this period, which not only enhanced the image of local officials, but also increased the thick stack of achievements, and made the constellation behind Harry more interested. To know that the two tunnels are at least a million yuan project, they support Harry's ultimate goal, is not to gain profits? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A phone talked for more than forty minutes. Finally, after considering it, Governor Harry gave Doolin a desired answer. "If you can turn it into reality, then I will support you. You have four years. I will go to other places after four years, so you have to complete everything you said before I leave. Is there any problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't of course He will tell Harry that he can't do it. He vowed to say: "Mr. Harry, if you are not very busy recently, you can pay more attention to the information here. In addition, the settlement date of this quarter is coming, you can pay a little attention." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good, I am looking forward to your performance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hanging up the phone, Doolin’s The cigarette had already burned to the end. He took a sip and threw it out of the window. He made Harry, and he had no opponents in this state. He could safely and boldly implement his plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the table and glanced at the four ropes on the right hand side, a little black-faced memories, and then pulled out one of them and slammed it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Otis is very poor and backward. It is like an exile of officials, so the basic hardware construction is far from home. In order to facilitate the mayor to find the staff of each office do not need to run downstairs, so the former mayor did this thing. The rope will be introduced into other offices through the pipeline. When Du Lin pulls the rope on this side, the other bell will be slammed, which reminds the people in the office that the mayor is calling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting for three minutes, a document said that a 32-year-old woman walked into Doolin’s office, this guy called Natalie, East people. According to Thomson, the guy who broke the mouth claimed that she was not willing to accompany her boss to entertain, so she was sent here. Her husband also divorced her because of some little peach stories. Now she is single and has no children. When he said this rumor, Thomson drooled twice and was sucked back by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May Doolin, are you looking for me?", Natalie is dressed in a very elegant dress, biased towards neutrality, but the short skirt will tighten her hips Tightly wrapped, the white legs exude a natural and fascinating color in the sunlight through the window, which is indeed a very good woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded, and said something impatiently: "Look for someone to call the damn office building, and the city of Otis No telegraph office?", Natalie shook her head, and Du Lin wrapped his wrapper. "There is a telegraph secretary. This task is assigned to you. I then dialed 20,000 and put it on as soon as possible." Do you have any problems?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
