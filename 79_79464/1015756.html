			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsible for the officer of Doolin, not only the lieutenant, but also a captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not "cheap" to the place where the Mennon is going. After the Western Military Region solicited the opinions of the Ministry of National Defense, he not only gave more than the farmers in the reception staff. The treatment is also quite care for Du Lin's emotions. Unfortunately, Doolin did not intend to do what they planned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called Thomas a week ago, in addition to congratulations on his becoming the youngest young general of the Imperial Navy, he also asked him to come over and discuss Look at the business problems on the East Coast of the New Year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big problem, at least when it’s on the shoulders of Major General Thomas. At present, with the recovery of the economy, wages in various places are growing, people's pockets are getting more and more money, and the ability to consume alcohol is getting stronger. In the past, people spent 25 minutes to buy a glass of wine may feel a little extravagant, now it is not very expensive to buy a glass of wine for 35 minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, in order to compete for more markets and sales, the authorized parties of Doolin's distillation method actively cleaned up the "illegal" within their sphere of influence. Workshops, which further expand the production and shipments of major wineries. Since the end of last year, Irian’s “Fragrance Island” has been shipped more than 800,000 bottles per month, and this year it has once again increased to one million bottles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the transportation agreement signed by Du Lin and the Navy, the space was not used to calculate transportation costs, but the method of recording was adopted. Every time the Navy's transport ship pulls a bottle of wine from the small island of Irian, Du Lin will pay them 50% of the transportation cost. One million bottles a month requires a transportation fee of 500,000 yuan, and one year is six million. This stable credit makes Thomas a red man in the navy's top management. No naval base is not only self-sufficient. It is also able to support military spending to the Navy headquarters, except for the Irian Naval Base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding to Doolin and Thomas on the phone about the new business, this is enough for Thomas to immediately let go of everything in his hands to see Doolin, he knows he can Being a major will inevitably help Du Lin. If there is a contradiction between him and Du Lin and the cooperation breaks down, he will be a major general, but he is definitely not a valuable general, perhaps sent to a bird. Spend the rest of your life in the naval base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you have any questions, you can ask here. My friend is seriously injured and should not go to other places. If your superior has anything to blame, let him come to me." Major General Thomas took a look at Du Lin. I will stay here for a few days, and I will not go anywhere!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two officers standing at the door looked at each other and succumbed to leave immediately. They have to report the situation here to the command, and the situation is now beyond their capabilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the door was closed, Thomas asked curiously: "Who did you provoke? Actually dare to assassinate you? Need me to do something for you?" At this time, Thomas has already possessed the style of Major General in his eyes and tone. He now controls the Irian Naval Base and is a true general. Even if the time is not long, it is enough to cultivate his temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he first saw Doolin, he almost called to call the West Coast. No matter who the other person is, he will let that person regret himself. Born in this world. Du Lin is the most reliable, trustworthy and friendly partner of the Navy. He is almost dead, and may affect his future. How can Thomas endure? Fortunately, Doolin pressed him, otherwise there might be something big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin picked up the polygonal apple on the plate, as if she had seen such an apple in her memory. It is said that the apple can sell tens of millions of billions. . However, he did not have any interest in this apple, and put it back, letting Thomas put the plate aside. "These are small things. I am still alive. Isn't it? I didn't think that the Ministry of Defense looked so tight to the west that it happened slightly. After a little things, I entered the state of military control. So I need someone to help me, you happen to be the most suitable person, and I have another business to talk to you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us talk about our new business..." Du Lin made an action, and all the people in the corridor told the people in the corridor, and then locked the door, Du Lin touched I touched my lips. "You know, I bought a copper mine. I want to pull back to Irian to forge, so I need a stable transportation route. In fact, it is more reliable and safer to take the land than to go by sea, but we are Isn't your friend? I would rather spend a little more money and leave this money to my friend, Thomas!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words made Thomas very moved. Because he heard du Said is true. Yes, if you want to transport a lot of things to Irian in the western part of the country, the fastest and safest way is to use land transport. Buy a special train to pull the goods, and once it will be 20,000 to 30,000. But Du Lin really left this opportunity to him, so Du Lin may have to pay 10,000 to 30,000 more for each shipment of the same goods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a small sum of money, and because this is not a small sum of money, Thomas is very touched. "Actually... you don't have to do this. I am sitting in a stable position, everyone is serving me, above me. It is also very good." He looked at Du Lin very sincerely. "You have helped me so much. I don't know how to reward you. Now you have to give me this. I really don't know what to do." Ok!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it is." Du Lin sat on the bed with his hands on his back and sat down. Thomas immediately took the pillow and folded it. At the waist of Dooling, Du Lin said with a thank you, "Thomas, my friend, do you think that the Major General is your destination?", seeing Major General Thomas, who is looking at his face, Du Lin continued. "I want to say, absolutely not. The general will have a lieutenant above, the general will have a general, and the general will have a marshal. Thomas, you just entered this class, still at the bottom of this class, Far from the finish line!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the last time I said to you, we are friends, so whenever I am doing something that can bring benefits to my friends, I will think of my friends. "Thomas has gradually revealed the look of listening. Du Lin pointed to the apple. They all picked up a quick cut. He was a bit thirsty. "This time I went to the Irian from the west, I will definitely not." With the train, I want to use the sea. You may already have enough fame on the east coast. Many naval bases are familiar with you, but the empire's navy is very big, on the west coast side?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is an opportunity, Thomas. You are going to tell people on the West Coast side, I will ship from the west, no matter what, will pass you and then pass the West Coast Navy. I ship it to Irian. The price I give them is the same as the price given to you. Anyway, I have to spend money anyway, so why not spend money in a meaningful place? The general is just your beginning, on Will, even the marshal is you Goal!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas, even though he didn’t want to admit it, but the heart of pengpeng’s jump has betrayed himself, and Du Lin’s right is right, he’s just getting started. However, if he can maintain a very good relationship with these navies on the West Coast, he will definitely have an absolute impact on his promotion to the Lieutenant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In peacetime without war, the army’s change is very slow, in other words, a radish pit, a navy high-level general retired, he is empty The location will be nominated by him and finally screened to determine who will take his place. In the process, the Navy executives will consider a variety of factors, the most important of which are three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
