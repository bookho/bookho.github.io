			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerlis was replaced by a set of vertical trench coats, wearing a domed felt hat and standing in Dongcheng District after a simple dressing. Street. Opposite the road is a beautiful manor, the exquisite gardening is artistic, full of a high-level sense of style, it is hard to imagine this is a gang of gang leaders. It should probably belong to a tycoon, or a big man, not a leader of a gang who wanders around the gray and black edges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gate of the manor has been smashed, and several guys are standing on a blood-stained car with a smashed car on the side of the car. This kind of thousands of cars is even damaged, and it is higher than the level of the carriage. At least it can make people feel that the characters sitting in the car can use the crystal as a consumable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a lot of life is actually a little tight, but girls who bought a lot of master crafts decorations are easy to use, not applicable, not a problem, the problem It is they who need to prove to the people around them that they can afford such goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man always unknowingly raises his social class and grade as much as possible, even if he tightens his belt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Ellis may not have this kind of distress, because his thoughts are not "progressive", and he has not understood the deeper meaning, his Attention was placed on the car, belonging to Wood's car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tnel City has no traffic police. The city address is too remote and the economy is underdeveloped. There are more horse-drawn carriages on the road than cars. Secondly, the city is so small, the road planning also adopts a square method, and there is no need to direct traffic. So until now, there are no license plates for cars driving in the city of Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that Ordo and other big cities have already activated the license plate, but not yet. How to tell who a car belongs to, there are two tricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to look at the lights, the second is to look at the mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalists in order to save costs, many "high-end" car lights are still using kerosene lamps, that is, the outside of the wire, there is a glass inside The hood has a kerosene lamp with a flame inside. Most people who buy cars are rich, so the first thing they get in the car is to make modifications. By driving a belt with the help of the engine gear set, it is possible to illuminate the brighter lighting after the launch, which is the common pursuit of all the owners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those car owners who are willing to spend two hundred dollars to buy a pair of lights, it is also in line with their consumer psychology to spend two hundred pieces to customize the lights for their own lights. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second place that can be distinguished is the markup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The license plate system has not been implemented in the Teier City area, so I want to know who is sitting in the car that has disappeared from the window, except sometimes In addition to the invisible lights, there are markers to identify. Everyone's mark has some graphic features that match their own characteristics or have a special meaning. The mayor’s mark is a sterling silver angel with arms outstretched, and Mr.’s mark is a compass made of pure gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood's mark is well-resolved, has a high degree of discriminating, and is a stump of gold silk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this car is just across the road from Ellis. There was some sweat on his forehead, some of which was due to the loss of physical strength caused by blood loss after the injury, and the sweat caused by the body after a long walk. There are others, because they are worried, because the person living in the manor opposite is called Codor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Codor is very famous in the city of Tener. Although he does not have many notoriety, everyone is afraid of him. If Wood commissioned a singer...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice couldn’t think about it, he let his companions peg at the door and immediately returned to Queen Street He needs to tell Du Lin about the whole thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, Buddha entered the Maixiang Garden with three people. In fact, according to the rules of Maixiang Garden, guys like Dufo are not qualified to enter. But they drove the car brought by Wood's group, the doorman knew the car, so let them in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car was slowly docked about 30 meters outside of Wood’s villa. Through the front windshield, Buddha saw two guys in coats. Leaning against the wall outside the villa door, smoking and smoking. In the courtyard wall made up of shrubs and iron fences, three people gathered to talk and laugh. There was also a guy standing on the balcony on the second floor of the villa, constantly moving around and scanning the entire villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the interior of the villa, I am sorry that he does not have the abilities that the priests say, can’t see it! However, from the outside scene, it seems that Graf did not come here, which makes the Buddha a bit strange. Grafna had no brains, and the brain was full of muscle fiber bastards. He couldn’t come, or... he knew where his family was being held, so he left the plan privately and ran to rescue. his family? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
