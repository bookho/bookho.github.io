			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin?", Mrs. Vivian showed some thoughts, for a moment, she hesitated and said: "What does this name seem to be? The place has heard of it." Her look is very indifferent. Du Lin is not a "small person" who is not outstanding. She has never heard of it is normal. If she is not taking care of Jon's face, she will definitely say that she has not heard of this. first name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a smile on Du Lin and doesn't care. Although Mrs. Vivian has been restricted by the house arrest, she is still Mrs. Vivian, she has her pride, even if she is lonely, no one can see her weak side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivian’s look slightly, carefully looking at Du Lin, suddenly asked: “Is this all arranged by you?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, if Mrs. Vivian does not understand what it is, she will be alive in her life. Obviously, Jon’s appearance was arranged by this guy named Du Lin. She hated looking at Du Lin and hated the Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Buddha wants to stop, and then closed his mouth and chose silence. He wants to say something, but no matter what he said, he can't change the fact that he is the fact that Du Lin arranged to be close to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Mrs. Vivian’s opinion, Jon may lie, Du Lin may continue to deceive her, but she did not expect that Du Lin actually recognized It’s down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Mrs. Jon, I specifically arranged him to be near you, and the purpose of my doing this is to hope that through Jon Shadow’s judgment, This affects the judgment of the mayor.", Mrs. Vivian's eyes are about to come out of the fire, she sneered and turned around, shutting up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a half-life in this life that hurts her the most, the first one is her husband, obviously to gain status and power, but to show one The disgusting face made her believe that it was all God's arrangement. So long after her marriage, Mrs. Vivienne did not return from the huge blow. She chose to retaliate against the mayor by debauchery. In fact, behind her, there may not be one. An unrealistic idea, she wants the mayor to be jealous, to prove that even if he is passionate about power, but also has her inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she failed. For her behavior, the mayor did not see it. He only cares about his current status, how much resources he has, and whether he has the chance to attack the governor's throne! Yes, Peter is preparing to hit the throne of the governor. He is wise not to listen to some low-energy opinions and gamble all his luck on the mid-term election. He is very clear that no matter how narrow the strength of the Kansas New Party and its weak strength, he has no chance to interrupt the re-election of the governor. Therefore, he put the opportunity in the next election year, he is now actively preparing, the fruits of the opportunity and victory will always be reserved for those who are prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Peter, who is passionate about power, his wife is only an embellishment in his life, but a process in which he fulfills his social responsibilities and cannot explain anything. However, Mrs. Vivienne’s pregnancy means another situation – he has lost control of his family, and many ordinary people will encounter such problems, which may be embarrassing for them, but they cannot be solved. Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Peter is a political figure, and every politician must at least show himself to the front of the people, take care of it properly, and the family is one of them. And is also the most important part. This part is not good, maybe the mayor is his peak, and it is even harder to go further. And this is also his side to control the state of non-proliferation (so far, apart from him, butler and Vivian, he does not think there are others who know this), while trying to hunt Jon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, you have to say the other half - Jon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first contact between Mrs. Vivienne and Jon was completely immersed in the thrill of body liberation, but gradually, Mrs. Vivian found herself There was a shameful feeling for Jon, which also made her quickly sink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She regards Jon as her own lover while also seeing him as his own child, and it all comes from such a game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For real sluts, the word "mother" may be just a joke, but for a woman who wants to be a mother, the word is given There are too many sacred things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a situation now, she is pregnant. She wants to be a mother, so she takes risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
