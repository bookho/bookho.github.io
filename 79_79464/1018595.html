			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you see the face of the person just now?", in a private room opposite the small hotel, two guys stood behind the window through the curtains There was a small gap between them, holding a telescope and looking at the window in the room opposite Du Lin. Just now they saw a guy wearing a cloak entering the hotel, and Du Lin, who had been smoking by the window, opened the door. Then the two men sat on the other side, unable to see the appearance of people entering the room of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp has temporarily left the West because of something, but he left a suggestion on how to deal with the current situation in the West. Plan to implement. Although the Security Committee is somewhat unhappy with the military affairs department, they can distinguish that work is work, emotion is emotion, and that their emotions cannot interfere with their work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are staring at Du Lin, who has been behind Doolin since the moment Dr. Leone left the hospital. Originally thought that Du Lin would go to see some big people or some relatively hidden places, I did not expect him to go directly to the steam locomotive. This made the two people feel that there was something serious about the situation. After reporting the situation, they also took the steam locomotive that Du Lin took, and fixed Duolin in the back of the train. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until they came to this town called Watson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another smoking guy shook his head and his face was a little dignified. "The guy's hood is oversized, like a preacher gathering. That kind of, even the chin can not see. I think this guy is very suspicious, Du Lin must be planning something, when he leaves, I think we should look at it and figure out his identity information.", he I played a little bit of ash. "Are you going, or am I going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plainclothes soldier holding the telescope hesitated, tracking Du Lin looked very dangerous, In some of the reports they have read about Doolin, Doolin’s threat level has reached an orange level, which is almost comparable to the dangers of those extreme organizations. Judging the degree of Dooling's threat is mainly to consider the potential harm and impact he may have on this empire. Both of them are absolutely equal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether he maintains an intimate relationship with the Navy, or he murdered the mayor of Nano Lindes himself to clear his power, Doolin They all show offensiveness different from ordinary people. Some psychologists have evaluated Du Lin, saying that he is like a wolf surrounded by danger. He is always licking his teeth and showing his teeth to warn others. Don't approach him easily, don't hurt easily. he. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if one thing, or a person meets Doolin’s requirements for his “Code of Conduct” framework, he will become safe again, even if you He will not make a surprising move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin seems to be very, very dangerous, but if it’s just a long stalk and doesn’t bother him, then Du Lin is relatively safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person who deliberately hides his identity is different. Why should he hide his identity? It is nothing more than to prevent others from knowing who he is, who he has met here, what he has to do. Regardless of whether the person’s aggressiveness in life is as obvious as Du Lin’s, it is dangerous to follow him. Tracking and stalking destroys the identity that he wants to hide. Once he is discovered by the other party, he can only survive on the spot. There is no other option to choose from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After analyzing the nature of the two men in a very short time, the man snorted and continued to turn his head and stared at the Doolin room through the telescope. The window, he whispered: "I am going to stare at the mysterious person, and Du Lin will hand it over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoking soldier smiled and shakes Shaking his head, he threw the almost ass of the cigarette butt on the ground, and lifted his toes and grinded it. "Forget it, or I will stare at the mysterious guy...", he knows that his companions will argue with himself, so he is the first to Said: "Don't grab it with me, Du Lin may go back soon. I heard that your wife is alive, do you want to see for yourself the moment your child was born?", he reached out on the shoulder of his companion. Squeezed hard, "That's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first floor of the opposite hotel, all Buddhas sit on the sofa for the guests to rest temporarily, he While holding the apple, I looked at the newspaper in my hand. At this time, a boy with a cap, who appeared to be only a teenager, ran over. The boy has the faces and characteristics of a Guar, and there are a large number of Guars in the West. In order to avoid the enslavement of the Ogildinians for hundreds of years, the empire of the Yaoxing Empire had almost revived the gualts who had won the final war. They adopted many policies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, killing the Guart royal family, burning all the temples of the gods, destroying all the Guarts about the royal family and the gods The books of the temple were recorded, and they were scattered to various parts of the empire. In the Civil War, a large number of adult males of the Guar and other minorities were involved in the war, which directly interrupted the backbone of the vast majority of defeated people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This method is very useful, psychologically, mentally, physically and comprehensively destroying the pride, beliefs and culture of the Guars. They did it, though it was despicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are also a large number of guerts in the west. This child is a guar ethnic group. There are more than 500 households in this small town. There are more than 3,700 people in the Guar family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy looked at the Buddha with some timidity, and the timidity in his heart dissipated a lot. The person who looks so beautiful will not be a bad person. He dared to go to the Buddha's side and whispered: "Big sister..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddhas stretched out their index fingers and made a gesture of shutting up," It’s a brother!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“All gods, are you a brother?” The little boy was shocked and he couldn’t believe his eyes actually deceived himself. It will take a while to get back to God and think about what I am doing here. He looked at the first floor of the hotel. In addition to the boss sitting at the counter watching TV constantly smirking, there was no other person. He got to the side of the Buddha, and he lowered his voice, and the heart thumped. Let him feel that he is completing a solemn and sacred mission. "After you came, two guys dressed in fashion were coming into the town. I don't know if that brother brought us attention?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin came to this small town and there was still a day away from Amon. He wandered around here and met the leader of the Guar people here. In fact, it is said that it is a leader. It is better to say that it is a person who has a little bit of money and is willing to bear a certain degree of racial responsibility. All the "sub-presidents" and "agents" selected by Doolin have this, they are willing to take on more responsibilities that are not their own, willing to help other ethnic groups seriously and voluntarily, and willing to tear the so-called when necessary. Peace and false justice and justice, in a relatively less civilized way, to bring back their belongings to their own people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, there is such a person, Du Lin and he said things outside, he thought that people here do not know themselves, but he did not expect very So many people appeared around him, greeted with enthusiasm, and shook hands with Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yaoxing royal family interrupted the Guar’s backbone and distributed these people to the empire, but they continued to love the Guart people. And communication, as well as the love of the family and the gods. Many gualts have letters with relatives who have been sent to other places. They will tell in the letters what happened to them. The most widely spread is a name - Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people say that Doolin is the Messiah given to you by the gods. He will certainly lead everyone out of hell like the first king. This makes many Guar people living in the gray world have new hope. Believe that your compatriots will not deceive themselves, because they can't get anything. Under such circumstances, Doolin's reputation was almost transmitted to the ears of all the Guars at a speed that he did not imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consecration of the Guarts here, and Du Lin told them that they will develop their careers throughout the West in a year or two, including this mountain. When the little town was in town, everyone was boiling. They have long been waiting for the arrival of this day, and the excited middle-aged man almost cried out. He solemnly took Du Lin’s hand and kissed Du Lin’s index finger... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These children are a small eyeliner left by Du Linshun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is sure that someone must stare at himself, so he needs to know who is staring at himself, how many people, what purpose they have, it’s not just For those monitoring from the official, it also comes from the distrust of some people in the Freedom Front. He has to make sure that he is safe. He also knows that some people in the Freedom Front must start to be dissatisfied with themselves, so he let the children spread to the nearby roads, if they see someone wearing fashionable clothes, or they don’t look like good people. At that time, let him know that he will handle the next thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha’s eyes are a glimpse. It seems that there has not been much change since the beginning. He has been laughing all the time. He touched the child’s head and took it out of his pocket. A banknote of a denomination of money was stuffed into the child's brim. "Tell me where they are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child leaned and pointed at the opposite side The dwelling house said: "It's there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha took the little boy's arm and encouraged: "It's not good, it's not safe, you go back first." Let's tell your friends, keep staring at the street."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy didn't leave immediately, his innocent eyes kept watching the Buddha, "that Would you tell another brother that I told you this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was something he said, but he could understand it, he nodded and said, "Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great!", the little boy turned and ran away from the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
