			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has always asked the fellow villagers to expand the "face" and not to increase the "thickness". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is “face”? The simple point is that there are many points, the points are connected to the line, and the lines are connected. One hundred and one cities in the empire have their own agents, and soon there will be fellowships in cities where there are no fellow villagers but agents. Coverage is the face. It is necessary to expand this face as much as possible, so that more cities have fellowships. Through this medium, more people can learn about Doolin and learn about Dolin’s work. They feel the change of Doolin's existence for their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is "thickness"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thickness is actually the number of people. The number of people in each of the fellowship clubs is basically kept at the scale of hundreds of people, and the maximum number will not exceed one thousand. Not only are so many people willing to participate in the association, but there are more people outside who wish to be part of the fellowship. It is not that the welfare benefits provided by Du Lin and the fellowships can only be enjoyed by members of the fellowships. Members of the fellowships can also enjoy the benefits and benefits that Du Lin provides them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people asked Doolin why not let more Guar brothers and sisters join the fellowship, and Du Lin did not give an accurate explanation. But he told everyone that this is a threshold, and it is necessary to maintain the current situation. There must be no possibility of getting out of control. This mouth can't be opened, at least not in the next ten years. Once this mouth is opened, everything that Du Lin will operate today will be a bubble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire constantly promotes the concept of fuzzy ethnic differences, constantly claiming that the provincial sages are good, the gualts are good, the northern barbarians are also empire A part of the initiative to advocate each other is a family slogan. In this way, the top empire hopes that a few non-mainstream people can honestly accept their current life, give them a nominal hope, and want to stabilize these people. They said that these high-sounding words are not really implemented. In all the best industries in every city, the people with the highest income are still Ogings, and those who live in slums are always provinces. Ya and gult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems easy to unite these people, just need to be easy to join. The question is, if these minority people who are in the right of being second-class citizens join a cohesive group, how will the top of the empire react? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe there is, and more is a feeling of trouble, because they must start cleaning up these "disobedient" minority. Can an organization that can condense millions or tens of millions of people be an ordinary organization? Impossible, this is a very obvious truth, and the leader who is respected by this group of people is a ambitioner like Du Lin. Maybe the cabinet will soon launch a large-scale cleanup and give the pustule before the crisis. Squeeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversely, if you really include so many people in the fellowship, is it good for Duolin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, in fact, there is nothing to say about the benefits, there are very bad effects. Because human beings are living creatures, humans prefer spiritual groups rather than physical groups. When the number of members in the association is too high, they will feel a very safe feeling. When the sense of security is uncontrolled and spread, there will be a terrible thought sprout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we have such a powerful force, why not make something that changes the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes you don’t want to do it, but the people who support you want you to do it, and when they think they have great strength, you will be group-conscious Control, not on the detachment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said that he would not do anything by force. War is not the best way to change the status quo. Wars are not able to resolve more than each other. Beyond hatred, it is impossible to bring any substantial benefits to both parties. It will only make people hate each other more and more, and then continue to reincarnate until one party is completely destroyed and completely destroyed from the body to the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is very good now, the number of all the clubs added is only 30,000 to 50,000, and even the Anti-Organizational Crime Investigation Bureau only thinks this is the largest in the empire. A "criminal organization" is just an organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very good, which shows that the Ogildins have not yet made a determination to the peas to fight the social turmoil and even to retreat to clear the Guars. Now I just think of these things as Doolin’s "tricks." <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it has laid a solid foundation for the future, now, what needs to be done is a little bit of change, quietly and without interest in completing the transformation of the butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin faced more and more scorching performances. He walked back and forth a few steps. He pointed out outside the room. "On the outside, people who have committed the Organized Crime Investigation Bureau monitor us in the bright and bright, and have regional guards. The people in the investigation bureau are investigating us, and even the military has begun to join the plan for us. They want to seize our handle, want to find our evidence, once again destroy all the pride we have, take us Fight back to the original shape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a special period, the darkest period before dawn, we have passed through the dark curtain that can't release any light. We must persist in the end, hold on to hope, wait for the dawn to come. And this, and then I will say to you to listen to, you need to understand everything carefully, fellow associations, including agents, must complete a huge Transformation, so that we can be more integrated into this society!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to disintegrate the enemy, first integrate yourself and the enemy "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first step is to converge on criminal behavior. Now our business has done a very good job. I have learned from all aspects that the fighting in various places has calmed down." Others have begun to accept us as an inevitable and important part of society. This is the best award for our sacrifice, battle, and resistance in the past few years! But fear does not allow us to fully integrate into it, we must meet The three views of this society, in line with the pulse of the times, will enable us to become them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next, I hope that all localities are bound by any form, Those outside are called "criminal" behaviors. If we encounter problems, we must actively solve them through legal channels. When we encounter disputes, we must be calm and reasonable. We cannot continue to hold guns and swords to let others fear. Bowing down, we want them to be convinced and let them take the initiative to bow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, some of you may want to ask me If some people really can't solve the dispute through normal channels, it's very simple, let him disappear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Make him in a reasonable way, get rid of it He asked our lawyers how to kill a person reasonably and get the sympathy of the judge. As long as they are not sentenced to death, even indefinite sentences can be accepted because we have a way to get people out. Nothing is done. If you don’t prepare anything, you will arrange for the gunmen to disappear. This is the most stupid way. From today, I need everyone to remember a little, try not to hurt others, if you must hurt others, Also find a legal way. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
