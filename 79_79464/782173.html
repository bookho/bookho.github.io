			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All capitalists and the capital in their hands are like sharks swimming under the sea. The chances of making money again and again are those mixed with blood, even if they are separated. Ten thousand meters, as long as you smell a little bit of bloody smell, these sharks will quickly rush to compete for every flesh and blood, even the bloody water they will not let go! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke opened a good start for everyone, when Du Lin and Juan said that they would cooperate with the George family, the faces of Irian’s rich were Laugh, my heart is already mad. The biggest wish of any capital trapped in a region is to go out instead of continuing to grow bigger locally. The George family is a great opportunity, not only because the George family has a very prominent position in the empire, but more importantly, their tentacles are wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s highly probable that the industry will be spread across all corners of the empire with this cooperation. As long as you can stand still and calm down, after a dozen or twenty years, it may not be the birth of another trust. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they had no excuses to intervene in this opportunity, the capitalists, although "no evil", would abide by the rules of convention, for example, as much as possible Go and touch someone else's cake. People hate spoilers. If you don't want your own things to be interfered with by others, then the best way is not to intervene in other people's business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, they have a chance, and they can ask for a bright and bright question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Alexander raised this question, Du Lin was not surprised at all. He calmed for a moment and shook his head. "Let's say, Mr. Alexander...", At Alexander's strong request, Du Lin removed some strange gentlemen. "Alexander, my friend, you haven't thought about it, and rushing to step into a field you don't understand, why not you are already familiar with it. The field continues to develop?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander stunned, his open hands look like he’s taking the hotel into his arms, "You are Said the hotel industry?", Du Lin nodded, Alexander frowned and shook his head. "Not that I want to refute your opinion, you may not understand the hotel industry. In the entire empire, the hotel industry is still In the 'winter break' period, apart from some cities on the east coast, the development of the hotel industry in the Mainland is extremely slow. I have also visited it, but there is nothing worthy of my heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this view of Alexander, Doolin held an objection. "I came out from a small place. Some people even laughed at me as a countryman. It is because I came out of a small place, so I know more about the changes in this empire. Do you know why the George family suddenly wants to be in the entertainment industry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised a very sharp question that allowed Alexander to shake his head, ghost Know how the George family's behemoth wants to do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because they also saw the revival of the empire!", Du Lin’s voice was firm and unquestionable. "There is no cinema in the small place I have been to before. But there is a theater where people like to spend it. At the beginning, the theater will only be open every Saturday night, about five stage plays, if you want to continue watching, you will have to wait until the next week. But when I leave The theater will perform three times a week. It will be performed once every other day. Do you know what it means?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't wait for Alexander to answer, Doolin Affirmatively speaking with a very powerful voice: "This means that the economy is recovering, people's money has become more, so after they have met the necessary conditions for material needs, they began to consider how to use the remaining money to make themselves Happy. Consumption, travel, and entertainment are the best means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have only been to Irian for half a year, and I don’t know anything about it, Alexander. You carefully I thought that the traffic volume and your income changed little before ten years ago, five years ago, and now?" Alexander fell into meditation. He never thought about this problem carefully. He only thought that the hotel business in these two years. Not bad, there is no deeper way to think about the changes behind this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin waited for him for a while, and when he was drinking his throat, he found that some people were standing next to him. They gave a sincere smile and silently. I listened to Doolin’s "high opinion" in the back. Du Lin did not say anything about this, but toasted them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander recovered from his thoughts for a while, and he smiled and nodded. "If it’s not as straightforward as you said, it may be very long in the future. I won't notice this for a while. It's good. From the beginning, I was only able to make a profit, and now I am making a profit every day. There is indeed a huge change!" He laughed himself and took a fear of his stomach. It was not so big a decade ago!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around them made a kind of laughter. In such social situations, self-deprecation and humor are the most powerful weapons to pull in. Du Lin followed and continued: "The economy is recovering, people start to use the extra money in their pockets. In order to satisfy their spiritual needs, entertainment, religion, education, tourism, etc. are all one of their choices. Based on this, the George family, who is in the Imperial City and has mastered the mouthpiece of the Empire, has a huge information channel. What, what is going to happen, they are the first to know. So they realize that in the past, the industry that was considered to be frozen is quietly recovering, they have such a plan."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's not that I don't have any specific industry to do now, maybe I won't reach into this industry. Maybe everyone thinks this is a very good cooperation opportunity, but I see it. This is actually a tough game. Because no matter how good I am, it is impossible to do better than the George family. It is impossible to have more financial resources than they do. So no matter what I do, I will always be the one who is passive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never regarded this as a worthy one. I have done my best to run the business. I just used it as a springboard. After I completed the cooperation, I have a higher level. After I went out to talk about business, I told those foreigners that John was my friend than waving. Money is more useful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another kind of laughter, and Du Lin describes himself as a city, like the treacherous little businessman on the street. This makes them feel funny, but also attracted by the personality charm that Du Lin shows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young, talkative, humorous, educated, demeanor..., he is like a guy coming out of a book, a darling of God, he still has A keen eye, more importantly, he does not have the attitude of those "genius prodigies". This is a person who wants to talk to him when he listens to him a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the laughter ended, Alexander’s mentality has changed. He asked in a tone of advice: “So what do you think I should do?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been more than a dozen people around, these people are local rich, they are also very concerned about this matter. In this ever-changing era it is difficult to figure out what the next world will look like. They have money in their hands, but they don't know how to spend the money, which makes it difficult for Ilyan's rich to get out of the area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Continue to strengthen your industry and consider layout in other places!” Du Lin took a sip with a glass of wine. “I have been building cinemas elsewhere, so I know a little about these things. Many places are big. The development potential, but people can not see. The land there is cheap, the price there is cheap, the labor there is cheap. A penny here is not willing to bend over to kneel, but there we will pay for a penny Break your head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the economy has completely recovered, before people realize that the great changes of the times have come, they are actively going out to lay out their own careers. The most reliable way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone stood behind and couldn’t help but ask: "Mr. Doolin, what do you think of speculation? Well-known old happiness Mr. and Mr. Luke over there are starting from speculation and getting rich quickly. Can we also try to speculate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a question , true advice, no Make things difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that Doolin’s words have made them aware of Doolin’s eyes, affirmed his thoughts, and hoped to get something valuable from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and shook his head and said: "I don't approve of any speculation. It's like gambling, and it's the result of gambling. We are next door to the state." The name of the farm tycoon is like this!”, people gave a sneer, everyone knows that the couple, like the old Fowlers, put all their bodies on the development of the city. Only Fleiss was right, and they were wrong. They have turned from rich to farmer, and perhaps this is the biggest joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his hand and the laughter of the people stopped. "I think the gambling investment behavior is speculation, but it is not gambling. An investment that does not take too much risk is a normal business practice. The empire's economy is beginning to recover, which means that in the next two decades, the real economy will have a leaps and bounds, and I personally prefer to have an industrial layout in terms of entities. Not to gamble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who raised the question showed a thoughtful look, and he toasted a cup of Doolin, regardless of Doolin’s guess. It can be achieved, at least he is right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businessmen can invest, only madmen go to speculation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
