			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at Stan Ein and looked at other researchers. Their smug look did not notice that the screen was being devastated. The screams of women, and this lab, seems to be somewhat out of place with this inter-generational product. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides a young guy, Doolin knows this guy, and every researcher at the Institute, Du Lin, knows and investigates them. The young man is called Robert, a very common name, just as he has only one ordinary life. Robert graduated from the Imperial College of Physics and joined two major companies, but was quickly dismissed on the grounds that there was no team spirit and disrupted team building. Du Lin asked him privately. He told Du Lin that he could not stand his talents being wasted in the endless basic experimental analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the labs of the big companies, the graduates of the Royal College of Physics are not at all outstanding, the big companies represent a strong capital, they There is no shortage of money to hire long-awaited scientists to serve them. In order to reflect the value of these scientists and their position in the laboratory, it is obviously very suitable to hire outstanding graduates from outstanding institutions to provide basic services for them. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Robert was dismissed until he found out that his mentor intended to continue his studies, only to discover that his mentor had left the Royal Academy on his own initiative. Similar to him, just a change of saying. His mentor was not satisfied with his project, he was deducted from research funding, and he had a quarrel with the college council. He also pointed out that some projects that invested a lot of research funds were basically rubbish, and he was swept out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Robert’s mentor, with Robert, entered the research island of Doolin with the introduction of a good friend and regarded it as his own home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any whimsical project here will be approved, and sufficient research funding will be allocated. The owner of the research room, Mr. Du Lin, is more like a Hidden in the deep science, the ideas and auras from time to time have promoted the rapid development of more than a dozen projects, including the project that everyone is presenting to Mr. Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most difficult part of this project is how to give simple electrical pulse signals more complex content, which involves coding, encryption, decryption, decoding. Wait for some questions. Similarly, in the course of the research, Du Lin put forward a key idea, why not use the set data matrix as the benchmark for decoding, so that you don't need to use simple electric pulses to express too much information, just need to activate step by step. The data matrices are then combined in order to form a completely new matrix that is projected directly onto the display. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is on, this is definitely a genius idea. Maybe after knowing this, there is nothing surprising about this kind of thinking, but everyone knows that without Duin’s idea, it is necessary to make at least a few suitable decoders. Year's time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these people are waiting for Du Lin’s praise like a good student, this is the glory of a good student! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After watching for a while, both sides panted and couldn’t tremble on the ground, and the poor female warriors, Du Lin nodded with satisfaction, “very good, change Another channel.", but waiting for him is a long silence, he raised his eyebrows slightly, "Don't tell me that you have not set more channels, or a set of decoders can only play a source of content. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stan’s explanation for the hard scalp, "Of course not, Mr. Doolin. It’s just that we have some minor troubles, this trouble is not on the terminal, But on the signal source.", then Stan's inserted another line into the decoder by means of the demonstration, and sure enough another set of images appeared on the TV screen, which is different from what Du Lin asked. He needs to be able to propagate pulse signals in multiple frequency bands on a single wire, allowing the TV terminal to play different programs according to the user's choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem has not been solved very well, because no one can guarantee that the content that each terminal needs to play is consistent, in other words It is said that when multiple terminals need to play multiple sources, multiple signal accesses are required. If there are twenty channels, then there must be twenty lines of signal access, and the signal can be changed by jumper before decoding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was speechless after listening, but he couldn’t blame this group of scientists. In this world, this era, what they are showing now can be called It is a technology that transcends the times. The pursuit of more sophisticated technology seems to have some hardships. The only thing that is fortunate is that this trouble can be solved. It only needs to increase the number of connected decoders to the same amount as the signal source. For example, there are twenty independent wires in the wires in the wires. Although stupid, it is stupid and stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the explanation, Du Lin just asked these scientists to continue research on this project, find the multi-band method of the signal source, and re-invest in the project. 100,000 research funding, and one million public research funding. The former is a special fund and can only be used for research in this area. As for the latter part of the public funds, as long as someone has proposed a project and the project has been approved by 75 percent of the researchers in the research room, they can apply. Go to this part of the funds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“When can these things be mass-produced on a large scale?” Before leaving, Du Lin asked a question, which related to the plan to send TV signals to thousands of households. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stan Ain and a few scientists gathered together for a while, then gave an answer, "We designed a brand new The circuit system, there should be no manufacturers that can be directly produced at present, so we need special machines to produce these things. In the second half of this year, the decoder can enter the mass production."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. Although this time was a little longer than he had imagined, it didn't matter. He could wait for a few more months. Just as Doolin encouraged the researchers to leave, Stan Ein told Du Lin that he had something unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean...the Bondika military group wants to buy our patent?", Du Lin was a little surprised, the Bondika Military Group is said to have a royal family behind it. The shadow, as it is not true, is not clear. Many of the group's top executives are big capitalists of noble origin, and the social relationship is very complicated. In addition, Bondica is recognized as a military-purchasing company by the Ministry of National Defense. The strength of this group company is very strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No shortage of money, no shortage of top talent in all fields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stan’s affirmed with a certain amount of acknowledgment, "That was the last time I told you about the lab... I missed it, they wanted us. In the hands of a formula that can produce hot and hot temperatures in a flash, and a special patent attorney representative to talk to us about these things. You know, the patents are yours, so you don't nod, I have no contact with each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Du Lin likes this group of "failed scientists". Their emotional intelligence is not high enough, otherwise they will not fall behind when they meet him. Street friends, not to be swept away by a well-known enterprise, can only rely on some school mixed projects to defraud research funding. In Du Lin's agreement with them, all of their research projects were commissioned by the research office to conduct project research, and sufficient funds were given. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the project has produced results, all registered patents belong to the wholly-owned research office of Doolin, which means that the patent belongs to Doolin. If a group of successful scientists may have fallen out with Du Lin, but these people are very satisfied with the environment, and also satisfied Du Lin's attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
