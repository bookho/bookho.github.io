			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin never fears to express his thoughts. He even likes this kind of behavior very much, because the magic of language can let others know their thoughts. Understand your own behavior and purpose. His words made everyone straightforward, because his language, his expression, his tone, it was like saying something ordinary but very sacred! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, each of us is absolutely clean when we come to this world, all are equal, there is no distinction between high and low, no one can discriminate Who, we are the sons of God, can come to this world, no one can make clean us dirty at that moment... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But in this society, in this world, the materialistic thoughts interfere with the equality of our beliefs, and the people dominated by desire divide the society into more Why is our existence so unfair? I don't know, but I believe that after experiencing something like today, we may be able to find something from it." Du Lin smiled and took a deep breath. Tones, "Ladies and gentlemen, today I am not the protagonist. The protagonist is Mr. Amon. Please let us let him finish the words, thank you very much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He owed a little owe, and sat back again. Some women looked at Du Lin and couldn't help feeling. No matter how people say him, spilling sewage on him or smashing his reputation, he has been doing himself. He is an outstanding young man. He is the most embarrassing star in this era, and it is definitely different from other dusty stars! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So kind, so shiny! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So soon people’s attention was refocused on Amon’s body, and Amon also adjusted his emotions slightly and continued to use the infectious voice. Continue to say, "I and all those who used to be slaves thanked Mr. Doolin for being as warm and bright as the sun. He let us climb back from the desperate hell to the light. I can't use words to describe me. Mr. Lin’s gratitude, if not my belief does not allow me to do this, I even want to be a humble servant to serve Mr. Doolin.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Lin gave us the long-lost freedom, gave us the power to stand on the ground to breathe our own air, and let our center retrieve the dignity as a true 'person'!”, Amon suddenly waved his fist Looking at his chest, the sound of pengpeng made some over-concentrated reporters startled. The more fierce he beats, the more people can feel the excitement of his body as thunderstorms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After Mr. Doolin released us, tell us that in the strange land of the Yaoxing Empire, between 300,000 and 500,000 slaves existed in various mining areas in the almost isolated environment of the west. They are slowly crawling in desperate hell like we used to, but not as lucky as we can be saved, they will fall into eternal indulgence in hell. From that moment on, I have a belief that I want Emancipate all slaves who are enslaved!" The sudden burst of tone is full of unshakable steadfastness. He is like a warrior facing the sea of ​​swords and knives. He stands on the edge of hell and struggles for the sake of faith and redemption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are always full of sympathy for the things that are generous and sad, especially those who are victims or weak themselves. The applause sounds again, but Amon does not stop. He has been saying that they have explained their ideals and beliefs to Du Lin, and they have also received funding from Doolin. They said that in order to save more slaves between the various mine owners, Mr. Federer also stood up and said that he also had slaves in his mine. He might not be able to do the same as Mr. Doolin’s great freedom to directly give slaves freedom. Fuck, but he has changed the living environment of the slaves and does not use those poor people as slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amon said that he initially wanted to use money to buy slaves, but was relentlessly rejected, and those mine owners did not guarantee the output of the mines. Will let go of any slaves who are still alive and have a workforce, so they begin to consider a slightly more radical approach to their goals. But at this time, those mine owners actually sent a mine protection team with modern weapons to attack them in order to protect their own interests. They had to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the joy and excitement of saving hundreds of slaves from the slave camp after the first battle, in the description of Amon, the whole west is like The land of a demon in hell, the mine owners and the mine protection team are big and small demons, only they are the real warriors. Such people's ideas and arguments are very much in line with the current three-view requirements of the mainstream society. People like to see justice to overcome evil, because people are not the owners of justice, and they are not covered by justice. They are more eager to see and justice. Related matters, to paralyze their true perception of society. Amor soon, Amon said that many gold diggers with ulterior motives have joined the great cause of their liberation of slaves, who want to rely on them to gain wealth, and Also took the initiative to give them a name, called the Freedom Front. Amon acknowledged that there are some bad guys with different purposes in the Freedom Front, but this does not hinder people's affirmation of Amon. Things quickly developed to a certain time ago, they saved a lot of slaves from a mining area, but then a group of horses washed the mine, and planted this bad name to Amon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After consultation, they decided to expose these things. On the second day of the decision, Amon took some people to contact Du Lin and then exposed them to the society. The Imperial Army attacked the valley where they were hiding. People who have gained freedom have suffered a ruthless slaughter from the highest will of this empire. They are labeled as numbers like animals, and the bodies are placed together and displayed as merits to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the matter is over here, but many people are thinking about one thing, why did the Amons plan to keep it by exposure, the army suddenly The strategy of change firstly starts with the Freedom Front and “completely annihilates” its own front line, leaving no one to live? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next one is the time for the reporter to ask questions. At the moment Federer said this, a 30-year-old young man stood up, he Asked with a serious face, "Mr. Federer, Mr. Amon and Mr. Doolin, can you ensure that everything you say is true, and will you be willing to appear in court for what you said in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very special person. The question he asked was not in Dulin’s standard question and answer to Federer, so Du Lin reached out and held Federer and nodded and said in person. "We guarantee that what we are talking about is the most real situation. If there is a need, we are willing to testify in court!" He looked at the young man, and the young man looked directly at it. The two looked at each other for more than ten seconds. The man nodded and immediately turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin didn’t make a mistake, this guy might be someone from the cabinet or the state government. They need to know what’s going on in the West. The turmoil even threatens the security of the country. Federer suddenly stood out as a very good platform, allowing them to learn more about what happened, and Du Lin participated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabinet is not really wanting to know everything that happened, they just want to know a standard answer, one can make the west settle down, not let some split The forces are staring at the standard answer in the West. This press conference just gave them a very standard standard answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is a very normal questioning session. Du Lin sat and watched Federer and Amon constantly answering questions, but they were thinking about What is irrelevant here is the closing plan on the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a variety of coincidences, in the collision and struggle of multiple consciousnesses, the West is in a mess. There is indeed Du Lin's credit, but there is also the merits of the doorman, the credit of Roel, and the credit of almost all who caused anything during this time. It's like a chain reaction. Everyone wants to get rid of what they have to do in the chaos, so there is no connection between them. It naturally maintains the chaos in the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, when this chaotic situation is quelled, then first, you must pick yourself up. In order not to let the official forces such as the cabinet and the state government focus on themselves, he and Dudu created the illusion of being assassinated. Each shot is carefully arranged, and there is also a doctor involved. Only the doctor knows where the shot looks very serious, but it does not pose a life threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the wound above the horns is also shot by Buddha with his gun on his scalp. This shot is critical because all Everyone knows that Du Lin is almost dead. He can go to see the king and the gods only one centimeter away. The official eyes quickly let him go, at least not strictly monitor all his actions, who Let him be a victim, and still the kind that almost died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now, you need someone to pay for some "unsolved mysteries", Du Lin has already selected these people - four West Mines Executive committee, as well as the doorman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These five people have considerable power in the West, and they have the ability to make the West completely turbulent, which is also the property that the finalist must possess. If a western shackle makes the west completely turbulent, even if it is true, people will not believe that it is a common sense that a scorpion does not have such ability. But if the people who let the western turmoil be the leader of the Kadima Party and the top of the largest real economic organization in the West, people can accept this result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have said long ago, who is definitely not a good person." There are always people who are unlucky to be more noble and nobler than themselves. And contribute their own meager strength to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four executives Du Lin has already arranged, and the next step is to arrange the door farmers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people found that the doormen arranged for four executives to run, what was their first thought? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
