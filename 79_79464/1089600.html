			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natiya as a senior partner of the South Commercial Bank, still has a certain influence in the bank's top management, and no matter how much influence, at least she and South The top executives of the firm know each other and have more or less relationships and can speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Geblin is a senior hacker whose job is to collect as much as possible the “channels” in his own environment. When he has a need, he will give the other party a condition that cannot be refused through his own unique way, and then let the other party do something for himself, for example, he voluntarily gives up Mr. Walter’s owe to him. Debt and interest, then let Natiya help him do something he can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that he has lost a lot of money, but he can get more money from other places, even things that go beyond money, like some Recognition and cooperation of big people. The prospects and future benefits of these things are much higher than those on the books. In addition to organizing the gambling, he has other ways to make these unrestricted requests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natya lost her status and work now, and Mr. Walter and Ms. Natiya have become worthless in the eyes of Mr. Gabriel. . In order to make up for the time and energy he had spent playing with Mr. Walter for so long, he needed to redeem the debts on the books in exchange for a reward he did not like. This is just a dead money, just the data on the bank passbook, it can't do more! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional amount of around 90,000 yuan, so much waste in half a year also makes Mr. Geblin a little annoyed, after all, the title of senior partner of South Commercial Bank still has Great use. He didn't know why Natiya lost the title and work. He wouldn't do more research on a couple who are about to become social junk, it would only waste his time and energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new House Cheetah sedan quietly and quietly parked in the villa area, Mr. Geblin came down from the car, he glanced at the villa, the corner of his mouth A smile appeared. Maybe he can buy this villa, of course he won't spend so much money, you can buy this quality resource with Mr. Walter's debt plus a small amount of cash. After waiting for a while, it may be two to three years later, and then selling it at a high price to those who are eager to squeeze into the upper class can be just right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned the civilized cane in his hand very gracefully and walked to the front of the house. He pressed the doorbell and looked at the yard. The green turf looked very comfortable. The price of the turf has risen to two or two squares and needs to be changed every month. If they don't change, their color will start to darken. It's not as pleasing as it is now, and the dark green color will give people a dirty feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yard is square, the courtyard here is basically the same, the swimming pool should be behind the house, where you can place a fountain and then re-paving a gravel road. Perhaps it is not bad to get a flower greenhouse, it seems to make people feel that the owner's character hobby is more elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has considered this villa as his own industry considering how to arrange it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is arguing between Walt and Natiya. In the face of Natiya’s questioning, Walter feels that he has lost a lot of face and even feels himself. Being humiliated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Natiya were classmates. They had some good feelings when they went to school, and they separated after graduation. Once he went to the bank to handle the business, just happened to meet Natiya who talked with others in the hall. After the meeting, they had a special surprise and had a meal together at night. At that time, Walter was just a very ordinary warehouse manager, looking after the warehouse for a large trading company. Although it is not a good job, it is not too bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a connection between the two people who met again, and more and more contacts, the relationship became more and more intimate, and finally finally came together, even Walter I can't believe that I have become the husband of Natiya. In fact, some people were not optimistic about this marriage at that time. Walter’s social status and income were far less than Natiya. They didn’t care too much. They felt that they could do well if they had a good life. Then her daughter was born. Considering that her daughter needs people to take care of her, Natiya is the main source of income in the family. After the two discussed, Walt quit her job and chose to take care of the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a friend’s party, everyone drank a lot of wine. At that time, a friend drunk and took the shoulders of Walter and said that he envied him very much. Good wife, he thought it was a good word, but the guy’s next sentence made him look blue. At that time, the man said: I also want a wife who can make money and be beautiful. I don’t need to work and have a lot of money in my life. It’s like dreaming to live this kind of time... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, Walter’s heart has had a low self-esteem that he could not tell. With the loss of time, Natiya has a higher level in the family. "Authority" also made Walter somewhat uncomfortable. Especially in terms of some major economic expenditures, Natiya has mastered the main control. She feels that she needs money, she will take the money to buy, she feels that if it is not necessary, it will "convincing" Walt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the economic right, Walter has no second way to go except to be persuaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the contradictions that have accumulated over the years and what he considers to be shame have erupted at this moment of great crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are always like this, you control my life, it determines everything about me, I am like you are spending money to buy electric toys that can be heated, You never respected my opinion!", Walter shouted loudly. "It used to be like this. Now it is the same. You don't even have to ask my thoughts and opinions to make a decision. You ask yourself, You respected me, didn't you, you really regarded me as your husband!", he rose red and stood in the living room and roared loudly. "I know that you look down on me, everyone looks down on me, this is Your purpose, is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I finally understand your sinister intentions, you let everyone laugh at me as a waste, only then can you Control all of me. Now, I said no, I won't leave here, I won't leave Sterley!", he said with his hair madly, "It's your business to leave this horse, but I will never go, never!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Na Ya like watching a stranger looking at her husband, from marriage to now for eight years, eight years and they never red face, he quarreled with him. Every time they need to make choices and decisions, Natiya also respects White very much. She will consult Walter and make a decision after he agrees. But why is it so ugly in Walt's eyes that she didn't jump up and refute Warth, but took a deep breath and pressed her inexplicable annoyance. "Sit down and say that quarrel can't solve any problem." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha...", Walter laughed a little madly, and he pointed to Natiya and continued to shout. "Look, you have to control me again." I am fed up with your attitude. Today I have to say no!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The couple did not notice the ringing bell that was constantly ringing because of the dispute. The shutter ringer became the sound of the door and they were alarmed. Natiya looked at Walter with some sadness and got up and walked to the door to open the door. Walt in the room gave a sigh of relief, there is no reason for hysterical roaring to make him feel a lot more comfortable, never been so comfortable after getting married. At the same time, there is also a hint of fear. If Natiya is divorced with him, he will never be able to pay the huge debt. He is likely to face prosecution and then go to jail, or be sent to a place to live a life that is not as good as death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While growing a sense of remorse, he began to think about how to clean up the sudden conflict. He took two steps back and forth and decided to wait until Natiya said something. He apologized for his impulse first. Natiya would forgive him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
