			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know where the problem is?" Kevin looked at the information and evidence on the table while looking at Vivienne sitting next to him. Just ending this debate, Vivian has begun to move toward a disadvantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Governor is alive, he likes to collect these works of art, and it is still a boutique. In fact, it is not so much a collection, but an investment. These works of art are hopeless for ordinary people, including some businessmen at the time. For those works of great artists with extraordinary skills and prestige, businessmen are not qualified to buy, only the nobles and the royal family can collect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, like many regulations, if it can not be implemented, it is a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, in order to seek a monopoly, many merchants sent a piece of art to the Governor’s Office to “taste” the Governor’s, in exchange for a certain item. The state’s monopoly rights, the Governor’s collection of many good things over the years. Good things naturally require better maintenance, and the collection method is also very critical. Some things are afraid of moisture, but some things are afraid of drying, but some things can't be wet or dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This requires a professional person to take charge of these various kinds of artworks. There are two such maintenance experts in the Governor’s House, or there is no such thing. Artist. They held the salary given to them by the Governor, while protecting the artworks from damage to the Governor, while pursuing their own art, so that their descendants forgot what art is, but more professional for maintenance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two brothers of Vivienne bought the two men and proved that they were on the corridors of the Governor’s Office and the art pieces hanging in the room. Collect things in the room. The Governor will replace some of them at regular intervals, so in the Governor’s oral testament, these things should be the things of her brothers, all of which belong to the classification of “artworks” in the Governor’s oral testament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been recognized by some jury members, and judges seem to have a tendency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Wei’an was shaking her head, she didn’t know where the problem was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin put everything in the bag after he packed it up. He stood up and walked outside, saying, "The problem is in your flower." The money is not enough! If you are willing to pay more money, you will not have the current situation after buying these two witnesses. Fortunately, today they are only the first time they show up, and there are not many things to confide. We still have To recover this way, you need to spend more money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vivian also stood up and walked outside with Kevin. "How much does it cost?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she is not greedy for those valuable The main reason why the art and her brothers are against the thin house is that the attitude of the two bastards has changed dramatically after the death of the Governor, and she just wants to keep the things she has now. It is what the Governor has given her, not in value, but in feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People always said that they lost their minds and realized that they regretted that after the Governor’s departure, Vivienne began to recall that it was safe to hide behind his father when he was a child. The place, the security that cannot be described in words, can't be forgotten for a long time. She wants to keep everything that the Governor has given her, no matter what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin’s footsteps, he turned and looked at Vivian. “It doesn’t depend on me, it depends on the appetite of those witnesses. If They can easily satisfy a few thousand pieces to let them choose to shut up, or something that tends to us. But if their appetite is big, maybe tens of thousands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I gave it, I want to see the effect of the money as soon as possible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of thousands are only trivial for Vivienne A little bit of wealth, she not only has the jewelry and house that the Governor has given her, she has a lot of value. Many people are supporting the feminist movement. As the initiator and leader of the Cannes women's feminist movement, she has received fundraising from many organizations and individuals. The money can be said to be a feminist organization, or it can be said to be her. After all, when she followed the trend to promote the feminist movement, the Governor of the Governor asked her to register the feminist organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already a social organization similar to the Social Movement Foundation, not a group of loose, unorganized individuals. Then as the owner of this organization, Vivian has the power to distribute the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car keys in Kevin’s hands flew twice with the movements in his hand, “Wait for me!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner at night, Kevin found one of the craftsmen who specialize in maintaining the artwork according to the information he collected. This guy lives in the upper town of Orodo, and can see Over the years he and his family have benefited a lot from the Governor. It’s no wonder that the Governor’s age is big after all, and the memory will have some problems because of aging. He may be able to recall the in-depth exchanges on the night of his 16th year, but he may not be able to remember How many people gave him how many things on his forty-two birthday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of his many collections are his favorite, his impressions will be very deep, and some of them are not like him, for example, a businessman gave him a male statue of the period of origin. He didn't like the statue and the gender features that were too prominent on the statue, but that didn't prevent the exaggerated statues that shaped some of the places from selling amazing prices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one thing needs to be made, enough for an ordinary family to spend a lifetime! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the green turf, Kevin stopped and walked on the gravel paved road, folded a small grass and smashed it. Sniffing at the tip of the nose, then he opened the turf and looked at the bottom of the turf with a bright streetlight and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood outside the door of Mr. Nears with his hands on his hands, pressed the doorbell, waited for about two minutes, and the door opened a small slit. Mr. Nels, who is 41 years old, looks only 34 years old and is very well maintained. He glanced at the visitors outside the door, and some displeased said: "I know you, Kevin Lawyer, you have something to do when you next court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He was just about to close the door, and Kevin put his briefcase into the door. "Mr. Nels, it only takes a minute. When I finish speaking, I will leave."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nears hesitated for a moment and gave up the idea of ​​closing the door. He came behind his wife’s inquiry and the voice of the boy. He perfunctory and walked out of the room. "Let's go outside and say, let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two went to the yard, the neighbors were at home, Kevin looked around The environment and the road without pedestrians, he whispered with a smile: "How much does it cost to revise the testimony?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nears waited for nothing After ten seconds, I was as hesitant as if I didn’t understand it. “What did you just say... is it for me to be perjury?”, he shook his head after he finished "I didn't expect your famous lawyer to use such a trick. The empire's judicial system is really disappointing." He said that he was about to leave when he turned, but Kevin stopped him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Nels, as far as I know, your salary is 85 yuan per month when the Governor is alive, isn't it?", Nairs did not stop and continued to walk towards the house. Kevin was not in a hurry and continued, "You must like flowers and plants, these turf are very beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
