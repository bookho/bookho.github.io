			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat in a shack built by a fisherman by the water and ate fishermen’s rice. This is a very "characteristic" food, steamed. Cooked wheat kernels and vegetables, as well as fish and a little fish soup, add a little salt to become a very typical fisherman's rice. In fact, in the end, it is because of poverty, vegetables and fish do not need to be purchased separately, some from the fields behind the beach, some from the ocean, cheap but able to fill the stomach, which is already a very good life for the fishermen. Giving a little money, sending children to school or buying a little furniture has almost become a major thing in the lives of these fishermen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of modern centralized fishing operations, the fishermen’s lives are not as comfortable as people think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Du Lin is very fragrant, which may be related to his first time eating, people are always full of curiosity and appreciation for the new things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted his wrist and glanced at the watch. Savi came in from the door. "It’s ours, are you leaving now?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head. "Have you seen it on board?" Savi stunned. Obviously, Du Lin put the spoon down and rubbed it. Look at the slimy fish soup on the mouth and look at the brothers around. "It’s 15 minutes ahead of our scheduled time, too early!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe they remember the wrong time." The owner of the house in the corner explained it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is in his fifties and looks older than his true age. The salty sea breeze is definitely the deadliest killer of the skin. Most people who don’t have enough money to maintain their skin at the beach will look older. His face was covered with wrinkles, his skin was rough and dark, and he was wrinkled on his forehead when he smiled. It was noticed that Du Lin’s gaze shifted over. He leaned slightly and bowed his head, very honest and honest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the plan, when Du Lin contacted the person responsible for the smuggling, they will arrive at the fishing village at 8:40 to pick them up and send them to the open sea to Shanghai. The ship of the army. The reason why we choose such a time is because on the one hand, with the popularization of the sea power law, countries have become more and more aware of Haiphong, and there will be a patrol every half hour on the federal side. If it is possible to encounter a patrolling naval patrol ship at 8:30, it will be staggered in time. On the other hand, it has something to do with the Imperial Navy. The purpose of this kind of warship is too great. If the sky is not completely black, it will easily be discovered by the federal patrol ship at sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the time is after eight o'clock, when the sky is completely black, the empire's navy will be close to the federal sea, waiting for Du Lin to board the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Du Lin, every step of his plan to develop and implement is very accurate, and there are very few leaks, but now there are some small accidents. The smuggling boat responsible for short-distance transportation was a little earlier than the scheduled plan, which made him feel a little bit wrong. If it is normal, he will not think that this is a problem. It is only a small matter to eat a little earlier. But now the situation is special, a little mistake may make him give up, he can not be careless, any unreasonable things need to be more cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin once again glanced at the watch and said, "You take the boat first to see, pay attention to safety, and come back immediately if there is any situation."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savi nodded hard and took some people to row the boat and sailed to the boat not far from the dock. Du Lin looked at the compatriot and smiled and pointed to the stool next to the table. "Let's talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savi went on the smuggling ship and No abnormalities were found and there were only three people on the entire ship. One is the captain of the smuggling ship, the guy responsible for sailing, and the role of a helper. There are no other people except these three people. Savi simply searched it again and found that they were carrying any weapons, everything was very normal, and there was nothing wrong with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin hesitated for a moment and finally decided to sit on the boat. If you don’t leave now, it’s not so easy to wait until tomorrow. The tunnel left over from the manor has already been discovered, and Doolin does not expect anyone responsible for pursuing him to be a fool. Once they found the direction of the tunnel, it was easy to guess that he would leave the waterway. After all, this is the fastest route. As long as they have such speculation, Du Lin will most likely not be able to go, telling the Navy that these people do not need to go to the naval base to ask the Navy what to do, just need to make a phone call, the Navy will be dispatched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the crew got on the boat, the captain and Du Lin greeted him and ran to the cockpit. Everything went so smoothly, and the smooth over-excellence made Du Lin always feel Something that is not quite right, there must be something that he has ignored. He glanced at the vague shadow of the fishing village pier and the small fishing village where there was no light. Suddenly he stopped and Buddha and Savy looked at him strangely. He suddenly turned to the cab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
