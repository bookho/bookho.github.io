			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an office next door to the Xie Lisi Street in the Imperial City, Joshua sits at one end of the oval office, looking at the employees on both sides with his legs crossed The smile on my face is completely blooming. He was curious to know what the bastards on the street next door would reveal if they knew they had sneaked back. Yes, he came to revenge, but before revenge he had to make himself stronger so that he didn't have to worry about being kicked out again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very professional brokers and related personnel related to finance on both sides of the office, some of which are Joshua’s old subordinates, and Part of it is a newcomer to Xie Lisi Street who has persistence and pursuit. He doesn't care about the level of these people. He believes that even a group of lambs can defeat a group of lions under his leadership and command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted his wrist and looked at the watch on his wrist, and immediately pointed the first employee on the left hand with the pen in his hand. It looked like forty years old. The very calm middle-aged man immediately packed up the things on the table and went to his own work desk outside the office to start making calls as planned. Three minutes later, the three major exchanges on Xie Lisi Street updated a news story. A listed entertainment company called “Fire Dragon Culture” was acquired by a large company and re-injected a huge amount of 10 million yuan for asset restructuring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This company changed its name to "Dream Factory" and has been transformed into a complex large-scale entertainment company. The news also announced that the company will be in the empire. Plans to build no less than two hundred cinemas have been completed, and almost 30 of them have already been completed. Some financial analysis agencies on Xie Lisi Street have indicated their opinions under this news. Some mainstream analysis and evaluation companies believe that DreamWorks’ “three-way battlefield” inserted into the theater field will disrupt the layout of the George family. The George family ruled the field of the theater and caused some trouble and resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there are some small analytical evaluation companies that believe that the strong presence of DreamWorks demonstrates the company’s determination to be a must in the field of cinema, and in the future it is highly likely The family has formed a confrontational trend in the field of cinema. Even if you can't do it, you can finally throw your own industry to the George family and make a big profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This company will be re-listed at 9:30 this morning to accept all purchase requests, and will be initially issued on the basis of Yuanhuolong culture (subscription) 4 million shares, the starting price per share is not less than $1.75, the stock code is "DWA.AAC". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Xie Lisi Street, a very ordinary day, there is no strange place, or people have adapted to all the strange things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another street less than a hundred meters from the AAC exchange, Joshua stood up, hands on the table, leaning forward Full of aggression, with a confident smile, whispered: "Gentlemen, the war has begun!", everyone rushed out of the office and started a crazy call, Joshua took the coffee and walked to the window facing the street Before, I watched the crowds on the street, and sipped a bitter coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xie Lisi, I am back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the time coming to 9:30 in the morning, there was no place for a fly in the exchange, and there was no place to fall and exhausted in the air, throughout the exchange. It’s people who are crazy about each other for a number. I don't know if the analysis and evaluation company's report has played a role, or is someone really optimistic about this stock called DreamWorks? In just two hours, the price of the stock has risen rapidly from $1.75 to $2.61. Nearly 50% increase! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are always a few stocks that are rising very quickly every month. Those brokers are madly gesticulating and screaming. There are flying blue bills everywhere, and there are businesses that carry calls back and forth everywhere. There is never any place in the world that is more busy than here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it Ms. Beyonce? Yes, it’s me, I offer you a very good stock, just two hours have been lifted since the opening Fifty percent, yes, you can call any evaluation company to ask about this stock. It has a lot of potential to tap. I think it is the best practice to enter now!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Tony, I am Xie Lisi Street..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Simon, I am here to you..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless people who are crazy about the constant flipping of small numbers marked with numbers, just after the stock called DreamWorks has risen to $3.19 for a while, suddenly The emergence of 100,000 shares broke the short-term stagnation, and the brokers who focused on this stock were even more crazy. It is clear that there are already large capital forces coming in, and they are optimistic about this stock. The sale of this stock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is in the past, such a forgotten place, when the sun hangs, the red light of the sunset spreads over the streets of Xie Lisi, the snoring suddenly ends, just like everyone is invisible Covered his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people are watching the dream factory that created the miracle of the first day of the listing, or the joy, or remorse, like many predecessors. Awakening numbers will make many people crazy today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$4.77, almost doubled, the husky brokers of the scorpion began to exit the exchange in an orderly manner, and the cleaners began to clean the ground. Layer blue bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today’s trading hours are over, but the changes brought by today’s exchanges are rapidly fermenting, and the night’s headlines in the evening’s Xie Lisi’s headlines are blackened and bold. The font is marked with a word - miracle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reporter used the exclamation mark and the amazed statement to express the inner shock many times in the article. The increase of three dollars means that many people’s wealth is short. It has doubled in a few hours. In particular, several large-scale purchases are enough for journalists to envy and hate. No one ever thinks that a digital game can affect the hearts of so many people. I didn’t even think that this game will be attracted to everyone from the day of birth. Eyes. At the same time, some analysts and evaluation companies started to push at night, and some of the companies that have a very good reputation and have been operating for a long time have consistently given DreamWorks a yellow color. The label and remind all investors not to follow blindly. However, some small analytical evaluation companies that are not so large have given green labels. They think that it is still the best time to enter, and even predict that this stock may rise to six dollars or even seven dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many unknowns, stockholders who have a little knowledge of stocks have picked up the phone and started calling their stockbrokers to ask if they can buy this stock tomorrow. There is no huge risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, for stockbrokers, their customers make money or lose money and they don’t have a dime relationship. What they need is the behavior of customers buying and selling. Only a sale can only extract enough commissions. Of course, some stockbrokers are very professional, because they understand that good word-of-mouth effects will bring them more customers and more income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the face of this stock that is full of miracles, they think there may be risks, but definitely not now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as many stocks will inevitably rise after they are issued, this is a recognized "law", although sometimes the law has a chance of indefinite law, but that After all, it is a minority. As more and more people start to pay attention to this stock, one thing has been identified in the small circle of stockbrokers, and this stock will go crazy in the coming week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua is sitting in a luxurious restaurant eating lobster from Irian, in Irian only need a dollar of lobster in the capital, on such occasions with In the environment, the price of thirty-nine dollars was sold. But people like to eat this thing, the hotel simply can't sell it, and there are not enough goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know?", he waved his knife and looked at each other’s face on the round table for a second or two before continuing. "We created a miracle today. Maybe we are not the most miraculous one, but the miracle is a miracle. Before I left the office, I had already called with the boss. All of you have doubled the basic salary and commission this month!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young people are cheering, they don’t care that it is an upscale place, which means they can get at least a thousand pieces this month! This made them unimaginable, knowing that some of them even just graduated from school, they did not think that their first job was actually so powerful. The old subordinates of Joshua are very dull. There is a lot of money, but they have seen more money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua raised his hand and said, "If you only have this, then I can omit it if I am next...", those cheering young people Suddenly closed his mouth, one by one excitedly watching Joshua, they know that there must be more exciting behind. Joshua smiled. "At the end of the year, everyone pays for two months, choose a place, and the company pays for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at this group Joshua smiled and shook his head. He picked up the napkin and wiped the sauce from the corner of his mouth. The smile covered by the napkin was temporarily distorted, and then returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his glass, "Might to the miracle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in Irian In the manorship worth 350,000 yuan, Du Lin tied the napkins. Today's dinner is beef. In Turner, he almost didn't eat spit when he ate this thing, but the beef here became an expensive food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
