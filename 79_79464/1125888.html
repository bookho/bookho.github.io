			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you are getting engaged with Ophelia?", Vivienne turned and asked another question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s marriage with the Timamont family is not a secret in the nobility circle, and some nobles have begun to prepare a gift for the engagement ceremony and the next wedding. In fact, many nobles do not recognize Du Lin’s status. In fact, in the dark, more or less must be sure of Du Lin’s ability to run such a big business without any background. This is some nobles. Things that can't be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he can stabilize the current situation and ensure that his industry is not problematic, a new aristocracy will be born after a hundred or two hundred years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a good young man and the most powerful family in the current empire, their gift list can not be as casual as the royal family to give something worthless It must be able to demonstrate its own discouragement, while at the same time highlighting the respect for both sides, including Vivienne is preparing for this ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. He glanced at the Buddha who was cutting the apple. He thought that he wanted to get some food from him. heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Wei’an was hesitant, and she glanced at the Buddha, and said softly, “I shouldn’t have told you these words, but soon you You will know. On a higher level, the dividing line between the New Party and the Old Party is not so clear, but the more down the situation, the more serious the situation is. Do you understand what I mean?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course!", Du Lin took a sip of the apple without peeling, crisp and delicious, which made his throat a lot more comfortable. I drank some wine at night, and some of my mouth was dry, which just relieved his discomfort. After swallowing the flesh in his mouth, he said, "Control!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Vivienne's eyes lit up, she laughed, many people said that Du Lin was a lucky goddess of luck, but she thought that all this is Doolin's own ability. Who can think of the clear confrontation between the old and the new parties, the real purpose of this situation is actually to deepen the control of all aspects of society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the old governor told her some secrets before she died, she might not understand this truth in her life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the grassroots of the two parties are reluctant to wrestle together. In some state legislatures, members of the old and new bipartisan parties are often exposed to ruthlessness, and even ridiculous incidents that have evolved into a bipartisan group of members of the masses and melees to interrupt the parliamentary process. But who can clearly see that the purpose of the two parties that the aristocratic system has been divided into two is not simply to fight for power, but to have a more reliable control over the entire empire society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two camps, which have a distinctly inclined society, that is, each citizen is assigned to two camps according to their "attributes". After the common "enemies" they will have the cohesiveness of the same enemy, and with the necessary guidance and release, some of the problems that existed in society will be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a terrible "conspiracy". If you don't know what the insider is saying, no one can discover the mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin knows that it was because he was determined to be engaged with the girl, from the attitude that Maggs turned to him, in some daily chats, some Some of the things that have been closed to him have also missed a gap. He is keenly aware that the top leaders of the New Party and the top of the old party may not be the opposite attitudes, but the grassroots side has the same dog’s brain as the silly dog. No one is guiding that big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone deliberately led the whole society to make such changes and create such oppositions and contradictions, what are their purposes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple, orderly opposition is more suitable for the requirements and development of the current era than disorderly chaos. Internal competitiveness is promoted under certain circumstances. It will be more suitable than the family to accelerate the overall evolution of society. In addition, in his dream world, he also read a book, and the book also has a similar view of the party struggle, which made him realize that the empire is not as simple as people's eyes, but rather complicated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apples that cut the apples looked at Du Lin’s bite of apples, and Vivienne’s constantly lifting glasses, and eating the apples again. . He had just found out that Du Lin was too late to take the apple on his plate, so he cut another one, but now... Hey, he sighed silently, how can these people who use their brains talk so hard to understand? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Apple is delicious! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of what Buddhism thinks at this time, Du Lin’s understanding of the whole society gave Vivian an incentive to continue to deepen the topic. “If someone can say hello, let the governor not interfere with my campaign in Ordo. Work, I believe that resistance will be much smaller. You know, sometimes such a key person can make a lot of effort in vain, or it may be a policy."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point Du Lin is very clear, he was doing this in the city of Otis, surrendering to him to give them a policy tilt, unwilling to cooperate to make them bankrupt through the formulation of local policies and regulations, he indulged After a while, I said, "I can't guarantee this, but I will mention it with Lord Maggs. It also requires you to use some contacts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, let's talk about another thing...", with Du Lin's assurance that Vivian was relieved a lot, she was not worried about the old party, although the Governor's death has been around for several years, the network that can be left behind Not completely dry . In the political turmoil of the cloud, you can survive and be a good friend, that is, a true good friend and a trustworthy person. Today, these people have reached out to help the old friend's daughter. In the future, Vivian will give them enough rewards. Anyone will have one day. Today, Vivian is rejected. Then someone may refuse their descendants in the future. This is not the case. Clear choices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded, and Vivian talked about another thing, "I hope you can support me financially."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a question of money..." Vivienne shakes his hand The wine glass, dark red with a faint fragrant liquid hanging on the wall of the cup slowly falling, like a red curtain, she looked for a while before turning to continue watching Du Lin, "There are still many women in the society. Discrimination and prejudice, and we find that the greatest persecution against women is the imbalance of labor rights, or you can understand the problem of family financial freedom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many The family is a woman who takes the children to do housework at home, and the husband goes out to work. Then the husband who is the only source of income in the family naturally has absolute control over the family's finances. In this case, the rights of women are obviously terrible. Injury, they must obey the dominance of men and lose their Belong to your own rights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many factories are also biased towards gender in recruitment, which is an ugly phenomenon, but want to change this Everything is not easy, look to the future, but you must start now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If you can, I hope that you can invest in three to five factories in Ordo, specifically for recruiting female employees, freeing women’s financial freedom, balancing the power of family members, and liberating some family women in the family. The position in the middle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Weian said that there is a very serious, the body is about to emit a sacred radiance, it looks like a sorrowful, like a church bible The Madonna described in the midst of it must be let out. After she finished speaking, she snorted and smiled a little. "Sorry, I am a little too excited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and said it doesn't matter," I can understand your mood and great mission, yes, I can understand.", can understand the fart, Duolin itself is a masculine, but also a spokesperson of pragmatism, useful for him to have a status, It is useless, that is, the class is dominated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched his chin and thought for a moment and nodded. "This is perfectly fine. Some industries are also very suitable for women, but you should also Understand that if the benefits generated by the factory cannot bear the expenses of the factory and there is a serious loss, I will not let it keep going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand if It’s really impossible to shut down the factory for this reason.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these two unwritten transactions, Mason’s campaign path is basically It can be ensured that there is no problem. Once Mason becomes the mayor, this means that the second politician in the Kemma family appears. This is a good thing. He even wants to operate his brothers and sisters. . If a family wants to continue to grow, it must firmly control the country's highest power and voice. There is nothing more reliable than the kiss to maintain this power excess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that Vivian and Dudu seem to have something to say, Du Lin left the room by going out to smoke, and after closing the door, Vivian Going to the edge of the sofa, one leg pressed against the legs of the Buddha, and the eyes were like silk. When I reached out and pushed the body tightly, even if the middle of the gun didn’t wrinkle, the Buddha would push it down on the sofa. She smashed it. Like the bloody sweet red lips, shouted a "little wolf dog", followed by a full house spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the room, Delil was blinded by Du Lin’s body, and Du Lin’s memory was deeply engraved in his mind. I still think of the pain in my head, and Du Lin has killed so many people over the years, always giving a terrible impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
