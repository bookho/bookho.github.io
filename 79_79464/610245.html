			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing? Let go!", Mason pressed his hand at the waist and pressed the cap on his head. The crowd crowded in and out, and occasionally someone arrogantly held him with an elbow, and he couldn’t tell who it was. Never underestimate the savage and difficult of the countrymen. The simple and honest farmer in the eyes of the nobility only exists in the artist's bizarre paintings. The countryside is definitely not a paradise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finally squeezed my chest into the middle of the crowd, and even lost my hat in a panic. He looked back and smirked in a few big laughs. In the middle of the hand, I took my own police cap back from the hands of a little girl, and I still don’t forget to say a thank you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the Xerma family are very polite, this is a stubborn stubbornness with the children... It’s not very stubborn, but the stereotypes still exist. Mr. Ma has a relationship. It is said that people are social animals. The one that affects a person will never be something happening to oneself, but from the discussion and eyes of the society. When people associate Mr. Kesma with the Kesma family, Mr. Kemer began to pay attention to politeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that he was not polite before, but he was a bit rude compared to the masked people in the city. Since then, the rude Mr. Xmas has disappeared and replaced by a polite Mr. Xema. If he does not care about the family group that sometimes is caused by the boundary stone, he did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has an example in life, you will feel that he can do anything, you think he is what you want to be in the future, in the In the Ma family, Mr. Kesma held this special position. He also influenced other people in the Xerma family and made them polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl’s face was red and smirked, revealing a slightly yellowish tooth, and the pock on the bridge of the nose was like the starry sky when the clouds broke open. Clear little stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason immediately regained his gaze and turned around. After wearing the police cap, he shot the pistol at the waist, opened the last few people, and walked into the crowd. Center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two months, he has suffered a lot. It is definitely not a comfortable thing to be a sheriff in a place like the country. The first job he wore on the badge was to find a lost cow for a big man who was stronger than him. Here, cattle do not bear the hard work of arable land. The cheapest and most common way for people to get fat is to look for fat from cattle. Therefore, the cow is almost the same as the pig of another world. The task is enough to be sent to the slaughterhouse when it is strong enough to be fat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cow is lost, and it is a heavy blow to a family. As a public security officer of Ziwei Town, Mason can only take on this task. In the end, he found a cow with mud on his body in a quagmire that was about to dry up. Its legs were broken, probably because it fell into the quagmire because of the emptying. Mason used all his strength and took two days to send the cow back to the town. Then he looked at the two brothers who were as strong as bears, and they took the cows and left them before they came back. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some trivial things, such as the chickens who don’t know why they don’t crow, and the residents who have been taken care of by the “timekeeping” ask Mason to let The "cock" who did not want to speak continued to speak. For example, the geese of the family suddenly did not lay eggs, as if the end of the world made people start panic, the only person in the town who seems to be able to ask for help is Mason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another old guy is drinking all day, every time he wakes up to prepare for the next drowsiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not a stench in the chest, and you want to prove that you can be a great policeman in your dreams, Mason may have given up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although so much time was wasted on these trivial things, it is undeniable that he did take a successful step, at least some people took him really When he was treated as a sheriff, and supported him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he opened the crowd, he saw a brand new car, and he could see his reflection from a smooth body like a layer of water. He licked his collar and put some sly hats on his face. He went to the guy who was facing him and wearing a white suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, I am the sheriff in the town, you don't know that it is not allowed to stop here...", Mason’s voice came to an abrupt end, his My eyes are getting bigger and bigger, until the last corner of my eyes hurts. "My God, Du Lin, how did you become like this?" He finally had the guts to reach out and be as smooth as the town. The Dongtou farmer’s daughter touched the skin like a slippery skin. “This is your car? Are you rich?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like Mason’s surprise in Doolin At this time, when Du Lin turned around, he also widened his eyes. He suddenly felt that his mind was a little chaotic. When Mr. Kemma was so open-minded, he would agree to Mason as a security officer? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
