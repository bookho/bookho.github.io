			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor’s said very rude, the faint sarcasm in the tone made Mrs. Vivian’s silver teeth bite, but she did not have the slightest rebuttal. It was her who chose Peter, who violated her father's requirements, and even wanted to sever her father-daughter relationship. Every time she chooses, she personally does it. Even if the Governor has given her the most correct choice, she also chooses her own path to the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People can do a lot of wrong things, but it's best not to regret, because regret means that you have denied everything you have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Weian knows this truth. When she was sitting in the arms of the Governor, she was told by the Governor, but she forgot it, and now she remembers it. So she doesn't regret it. Can you really regret it? This is not a short period of several years of experience. I have dedicated my best years, but I have regretted it. Is it not worth it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor’s wife looked at her face with a cold face and couldn’t help but smile, coughing a few times with a smile and a smile. Mrs. Vivienne immediately revealed the shock. She was just about to stand up and call the doctor in. The Governor’s arrogant waved. He refused Mrs. Vivian’s move to call the doctor. “My time is running out, To waste a little time left in the doctor's answer, let us say something else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Peter is a liar, but as a He is qualified as a politician. If he does not send someone to get rid of you, I will look down on him." The Governor does not seem to be standing entirely on Mrs. Vivian’s position to say something to comfort her. Instead, she said He has the advantage of Peter. He pointed out: "Any politician actually needs to play three roles, a good husband, a good father, a responsible official, and a cold-blooded executioner. If you don't play well, these three A role, then he must not be a good official."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I looked away, I thought he would not be a qualified politician, but he is... ...", the Governor has coughed a few more times," Don't look at me with this kind of look, I will let him pay the price, maybe this price is not what you want to see, but it will definitely make him more painful than killing him."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivienne’s brows are tight. “What are you going to do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor’s smile is like a naughty The child, in the true sense, has done a degree of eyebrows. "I will tell my old friends that the guy actually tried to hurt my family. Peter’s political career has come to an end. He will be kicked out of the old party, some of his. The scandal will also be exposed, he will be cast aside by everyone and completely insulated from politics. I believe this is the cruelest thing for an aspiring politician, presumably you have some experience?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivienne thought for a moment, and finally nodded slowly, and she looked a little happy. She knew what Peter valued the most, then took away his most precious things, and then waited until he had nothing to kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time as the first person in the Cannes State feminist movement and the representative and leader of the state feminist organization, Mrs. Vivian finally understood Peter’s enthusiasm for politics. From where you are, the kind of people who hold the fate of countless people, can let their own preferences determine the future of others, really great! Don't look at her as a representative of the feminist movement, but she has a lot of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, she is actively contacting the women’s rights organization in the capital, and intends to set up a “female rights organization” that will accommodate all women, even if there are some women. Reluctant to participate in this organization, they will also become the "protected person" of the organization. No matter what kind of situation they encounter, the feminist organization has the power and obligation to lead her, which is very scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are still negotiating how to protect women’s rights and interests, including the intensity of work, salary, industry, content, etc. Once these things are discussed There will be some subtle changes in the entire empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men don’t dare to act excessively on women, otherwise they must try what is called “keeping alive”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After speaking, someone knocked on the door and self-reported. It was the steward of the Governor. The Governor of the Governor asked him to come in. He came in and told the two after he came in. The child has already given it to the Buddha, which he personally received. When he finished, he retired. He knew that when the Governor and the Miss Vivian said something private at this time, he was not convenient to listen to, even if neither of them would object to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you trust that kid?", the Governor is somewhat interested. "You don't even believe your brother, but believe in a guy who lied to you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivian’s face was a little smiley. “That’s my child, but also his child. If he is willing to train Arthur into a The criminal, that is his thing, he will at least guarantee that he is alive. Besides, he is now with Du Lin, have I told you that the kid is already the mayor?", Vivian said The two men were obviously better than just now. "It took two years for the guy to become a mayor from a trivial little person. It’s a miracle!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor’s rebuttal: “Politics is not business, my dear daughter, you know far from these things. Peter is thorough. Perhaps this is a miracle for you, but for the guy named Du Lin. Say, this is someone who is dealing with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think there is any difference between the new party and the old party?"<br /><br />&nbsp Mrs. Vivian was stunned and then said a lot of different places. She stayed in Tern, stayed in Ordo, and went to the Imperial and other places. Therefore, her feelings are very deep. The New Party and the Old Party are two completely different political groups. If one is sunny, then the other is cloudy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor of the Governor laughed again. "You don't understand, you really don't understand. The New Party or the Old Party is actually not in my opinion." The difference is that they are like the palm of the hand and the back of the hand. When you need to use the palm of your hand, the palm will face up. When you need to use the back of the hand, the back of the hand will face up."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a miracle of a rich night in business. It is very clear to everyone that maybe only because of a negligible inspiration can create a tycoon. But politics is different, not enough to accumulate and enough It’s not a good thing to put him in the position of the mayor. It’s a bad thing. Others are marching down the hill to the top of the hill, but someone throws him directly on the cliff on the back of the hillside. I can't come down, there is him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More importantly, he now knows his situation!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor’s words have been a bit more, more than ever before. , And sometimes even a week today, so I do not say for a little more. In fact, he is very clear, as he said to Vivian before, his time is running out. If you don't say what you said at this time, maybe he will regret it at the last moment. Some things that are said to let others understand and learn do not mean that they have lost. This is a kind of inheritance and an alternative eternal life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They always said that when they used to have dinner, Peter came to a phone call, and the butler told the Governor of Peter that he was resting, but he didn’t come again. After the second call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey is actually very clear in his heart, regardless of whether he was involved in a car accident in Vivian, he must be responsible for it. He is ready, he has been a mayor for more than a decade, and it is not so easy to get him down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
