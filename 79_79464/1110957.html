			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long line of borders, a team of soldiers patrolling at night are walking their heads, the war is getting closer, these young soldiers are inside The sorrow in the middle is also growing stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one likes war, and no one wants the war to come, especially the soldiers at the bottom. The word cannon fodder may be too cruel, but this is the fact that the basic unit infantry is cannon fodder. Each shell is enough to make dozens of people disappear, turning into a broken limb of a place, and fighting for a complete human form. come out. They are also children of their parents, loved by their families, but their lives are worthless on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of patrols in the past few days has become more frequent, everyone’s heart is heavy, and there is always a premonition that something bad will happen. Every day is a new life and a new hell journey. The young soldier who walked in the middle of the team suddenly asked, "Is it really going to be a war? Can you not fight?" He said suddenly that he might have said something wrong, and quickly added, "I mean if you can It’s best to use peaceful means to resolve disputes. It’s best not to fight.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one in the team laughs at him because other people think so, actually speaking, they Although obeying the requirements of the superiors and respecting the choices of the federal government, it may not be entirely guilty of the federal government's ideas. It is only a matter of several people, but with the lives of tens of thousands of soldiers, to maintain the decent of several people and a few people, is this exchange worth it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one speaks, the soldier who speaks no longer speaks, and one team continues to move forward, and it takes about twenty minutes to walk. When I saw the next outpost, the leading soldier suddenly stopped and the other veterans turned a little weird. They are not recruits, not conscripts and recruits forcibly recruited into the army. They have experienced joint exercises and know that when there is a slight vibration on the soles of the feet, it means that large-scale war machines are moving fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?", the recruit who just spoke in a puzzled question, he couldn't see the faces of these veterans in the night, but he was a little confused. So he couldn't help but blurt out and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veterans remained silent. After about twenty seconds, the captain shouted an urgent march and immediately ran. The recruits didn't understand what was going on. It was always wrong to follow the captain. When they ran into the sentry, they suddenly heard a sharp whistle in their ears... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire post was blown up, and the explosion was heard at this time in the ears of some soldiers who remained intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no special effect of the sky, no people rushing to scream and lie down, the shrapnel and the shattered bricks swept the radius three Everything "standing" within ten meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting the war! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire did not declare war in the middle of the night. Under the moonlight, a large war machine mobilized twelve huge robotic arms to quickly rush toward the border. On the platform of the weapons of these war machines, a cannon constantly spurts strong smoke, like the devil in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp on the federal border immediately remembered the harsh warning, a large number of soldiers rushed out of the camp, armed with weapons to the front line, suddenly rising in the sky With hundreds of flares, the war started completely. At the same time, the Empire announced to all known countries by telephone and telegram, and the Empire officially declared war on the Federation and entered the state of war from the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, Mr. Sail was woken up. He licked his face and sat up from the bed, asking without looking back. "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler outside the door whispered, "War When the empire broke out, the empire did not declare war. It was only half an hour after the war broke out. I thought it should be told."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Sail took a moment , sighed, "Thank you, I know, help me prepare clothes and cars, I am going to the parliament building." After the butler left, Mr. Sail stood up, he simply took a shower, then Changed a suit and got on the bus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was in the car, he began to think about how to deal with the situation in the future. Although this war is, to a certain extent, he insisted on forcing the empire to cooperate with him, he was directed by him, but after the war really broke out, how to end it would not necessarily follow the script. He opened the box and there was nothing in the box. No one knows how to close the box. Once the state of war begins, many things will deviate from the planned track. If the Federation can't hold on to the previous rounds of offense, maybe the Empire will do the trick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
