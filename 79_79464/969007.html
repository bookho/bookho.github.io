			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Survivor of the Miracle<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We still have hope"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The night will finally greet the sun"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gift of God"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A newspaper is reporting on the news of the "survivor" and more "survivors". Absolutely inspiring news, these people are not completely dead, they are still struggling for help in the rubble, and the seriously injured survivor was interviewed by reporters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was lying in a clean, clean bed in the hospital, telling reporters in the room and outside the window about his psychological journey after his death. He first thanked the Empire for the first time. Timely reaction and search and rescue work, thanks to the mercy that God gave him, thanked his wife and children, and thanked all of them and everything for letting him spend the most desperate and fearful period of his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the tunnel collapsed, he fell to the ground, and all the light around him disappeared at that moment. He struggled but fell. The steel bars and some stones that broke down broke his hands and feet and pressed him underneath to break free. The whole world is always desperate to see the light, he thought that he would die there, he began to fear, began to be crazy, but his family awakened his desire to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ate some dirt in the process, the taste is very bad, but can withstand the hunger. When he is thirsty, he will go to the cold "ice stones" that have been covered with ice. What he felt the most fearful during the time he insisted on was the constant decline in body temperature. He felt colder and colder, so there was no wind in the ruins, and he wore it thicker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slept twice on the way. Fortunately, he woke up every time. His emotional memories and two cryings were won. Tears of all journalists and medical staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a strong person, a person who fights for himself and his family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Otis not only exempted him from all medical expenses, but also compensated him for two thousand dollars in accordance with the standard of three levels of disability. And the joint construction guarantees that after his fracture is healed, he will continue to hire him to serve the company and give the manager a salary. The worker also expressed the recognition of such compensation and appreciated the attitude of the joint construction workers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in search and rescue work, it is not always such inspiring news, and the dead are constantly being found, but soon the newspapers no longer pay attention to these news clues. Compared to those sad news, those who are constantly appearing and rescued are the news that should really be reported. This is in line with people's support for ethics, people like this news and pay for it to buy the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, at the press conference of the City Hall of Otis City, Scott, wearing a new formal dress, stood on the stage and he looked Heavy, a white flower is worn on the chest. He looked around at the reporters in the venue and held them together. "Let us mourn for all the victims for a minute, thank you!", saying that he closed his eyes, and the reporters stood up after a little swearing. To mourn for those who died in the disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, both the reporters present and some members of the community with a sense of justice and responsibility know that the so-called mourning is the "opening ceremony" of this press conference. However, everyone is very well equipped, maybe they can spend a minute thinking about what to eat at noon, or which girlfriend to roll sheets at night, or some reporters to consider how to write a press release that can promote newspaper sales. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, everyone is like that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott stood on the stage with a little emotion. Two days ago, Doolin called him to invite him to become the mayor of the city hall of Otis City. At the same time, he was a part-time press officer. He decided to quit his job at the Irian side without much consideration. He came to Otis in the earnest reservation of Hossington. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not give him a brilliant future for HTC, just told him that if he is satisfied, he can act as a post after he leaves. The spokesperson of his own interests continues to work in the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "interest spokesperson" does not seem to be a great name, even a formal position, but Scott is very clear that Du Lin put this one poor white The place is built like this, how much precious "wealth" he left in his class. He needs to have a "dragon" to help him to look at the things here. He may have his own approved candidates before, but from now on, he is the one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will be the "shadow mayor" of the city. This kind of power is far from the lie that looks sweet. The real benefits make him not think about it for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time in one minute is very short, and it can be very long. After Scott opened his eyes, his face became more and more painful. He is actually very grateful to Hossington, and he has given him a six-year working life, and he has accumulated a wealth of social experience and acting skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please sit down... First of all, thank you for taking the time to participate in this press conference in the busy work. All the journalists and friends present at the event can receive it at the event. A gift is a local specialty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So we officially started this press conference, first I will give you a description, according to the empire The unanimous reply from the three famous architectural design companies and the accident report submitted by the joint construction workers, we can clearly find out that the main responsibility of the accident comes from the data error in the joint construction. The engineer ignored the weight brought by Blizzard and the construction machinery failed to clean up the falling rock in the ceiling. Combined with other reasons, the accident occurred..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Otis is a transparent city. We don't hide the problems like other cities. We will put everything in the sun and everyone can look at it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the feedback from the search and rescue team to the current search and rescue situation, we found a total of 221 bodies at the scene of the accident, and will be 466 The injured workers were sent to hospitals in the local and foreign countries for rescue treatment. According to the paycheck we got, there were about 300 workers trapped in the rubble. Our time is running out, but I believe Miracles will once again come to this land, and God will love us, and will bless us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In compensation, all injured or dead workers’ compensation In accordance with the current five-level compensation system implemented by the empire, Mr. Du Lin, the mayor of Otis, clearly stated that he would urge the joint construction workers to pay the compensation for all the victims and the wounded, if the joint construction workers could not get enough The money will be compensated, then the City Hall of Otis will make a first step to ensure that all the families in need will not be affected by this accident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I know a lot of people are Concerned about such a big accident, the east-west railway will continue to build. On behalf of the City Hall of the City of Otis and the Mayor of the city, Mr. Du Lin, I will tell you that yes, we will continue to build. Joint construction cannot. Then change, we have the confidence and responsibility to overcome all the difficulties and solve the biggest problem facing the current road traffic in the city of Otis. Also ask the citizens and citizens of the empire to understand and understand, and continue to support our work. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
