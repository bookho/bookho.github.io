			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time is always so unforgettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Du Lin once thought that the place to live in the country should be the worst and worst place in his life. The feeling of six brothers crowded together can definitely make People are swaying. Every day, besides working, it is work, and often tired to sleep directly on the bed. In the uncleaned bedroom, there were faint foot odors and sweaty smells in 365 days a year. After the sisters and sisters came over once, they were no longer willing to come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in this room with only thirty square feet, it actually squeezes twenty people! Not to mention the smell of sweat and the smell of the feet, there is also a kind of can not say, but exudes a strong taste that can cause changes in the body's hormones. The yellowish black walls are covered with posters of women's red fruits, which are always covered with various yellow watermarks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The toilet is just outside the bedroom door, the smell of suffocating urine and the smell of the similar fertilizer in the countryside that is raised by the sewer is always between the door and the door. Filled the entire bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lying on a bed that feels wet, the thinness in the hand is covered with a layer of oily ash, and there is a stench of odor, Doolin curls up the body Frozen, not willing to cover the bed that is obviously awful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a special practical sleep, in the middle of the night he seems to no longer fear the warmth, and returned to his home lying in his bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the next day he got up, he realized where the warmth came from - the black quilt had been covered by him, After losing subjective thoughts, the subconscious of the creature can always find more suitable things for the creatures to avoid hurting themselves and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed the quilt away with disgusting, and there was no place to groom. A group of people crowded together and walked to the station platform. The first shift in the morning began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things you carry are not much different from yesterday, and they are very familiar. Inside the bracket of the wood is a tightly packed box. When you walk and shake, you can feel the liquid shaking inside, and occasionally the sound of glass collision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?", Du Lin took the arm of Graf and asked, "It seems to be water."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Water?", Graf squinted at Du Lin with disdain. "Is it all banknotes? Banknotes!" After a while, he whispered: "Don't go around, it's height inside." Wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stunned. When he was just about to ask, Graf licked him and swallowed what he wanted to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some legal provisions in the law of the Empire concerning the brewing, transportation and sale of alcohol, including explicit provisions for the strict production of high-alcohol anywhere. According to the law, the alcohol content of all food and beverages should not exceed 9%, and the alcohol content of wine should not exceed 13%. Even if the contraband is exceeded, it needs to be destroyed, and the brewing manufacturer also needs to be punished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why there is such a law is said to be because all the alcoholic drinks in the theocracy law are considered to be full of demons, so the clerics are forbidden. Drink with believers. At the beginning, the empire did not recognize the interpretation of the drink and drink in the Theocracy Law. Later, because the Imperial Three Emperors drunk excessively, they spurted out the black liquid and died soon. This law was passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, high-alcohol has become a contraband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ask what is the fastest-growing business in the world, you can understand it by looking at legal books. The Empire official banned the sale of high-alcohol, but made the high-alcohol a best-selling product. Coupled with the post-war change society is still in a state of low and wilting, more people need to be able to anesthetize their own things as soon as possible, of which high wine is a good choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-altitude wine on the open side is forbidden to produce and sell, but in order to make the banknotes that people can satisfy, many places are in the semi-dark and semi-dark production and sales, even Steam locomotive to transport! The goods that are rushing through the night are almost always high-alcohol. These wines are sold to the whole country by steam locomotives and railroads, making huge profits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a phrase written by people in the workshop, called "the closer to the devil, the more the pocket is", which is the profit brought by the high liquor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before dawn, Du Lin considered the matter of high alcohol while carrying the goods. From the world in the dream, he learned that the wine can be obtained by distillation to obtain high-purity alcohol, and then blended with spices and a certain proportion of water, it becomes a high spirit. He didn't know what it was like to drink something in his mouth, but he could easily guess the taste of those things from the faces of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a little absent-minded in this morning's work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was at noon, he took Graf to the side of the railway outside the restaurant and looked around, asking: "Grav, we are Brother, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf patted his chest, “Of course, brother!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Very good, brother, can you tell me how much the amount of alcohol is? I mean a bottle, like the bottles in the box we didn't move in the morning." Du Lin wrote a stroke, he There needs to be a comparison to know if you will make money by doing this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf looks like a big man, and a little stupid - no smart person will put a little pepper in the cigarette, but he will do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is definitely smarter than what he has shown. When Doolin asked this question, he immediately became alert. "What?" Do you want to buy a bottle? If you listen to me, you can buy a bottle of rookie for a month, at most."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So expensive? Du Lin took a sigh of relief, knowing that he can earn at least five dollars this month, which means that a bottle of wine is equal to his monthly income? The flame that had already been extinguished in the heart was ignited again, and his body shook slightly. Damn, damn it! How old is it that I can only value the price of a bottle of wine like an old dog? Damn it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Doolin’s crazy eyes, Graf pulled him hard. “What happened to you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s glimpse, after returning to God, is only a sixteen-year-old boy. Even when dreaming of a big man’s life, he still can’t hide his own heart. He tried to tighten the muscles on his face and finally laughed. "I am fine, rest assured, I have never felt as good as it is now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Right, can you tell me how much a bottle of low-alcohol?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf looked around and took Du Lin to go further Some, according to him and he squatted in the grass together, "Damn, I must know that you have any way to get money, are you going to sell it with high-alcohol blending water? Don't consider this stupid way. You will lose money. A bottle of low-alcohol is only sixty cents, and a good one is only eighty to ninety. If you use high-alcohol water, you must lose money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
