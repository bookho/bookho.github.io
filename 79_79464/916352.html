			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark lets the secretary contact the private place where the meeting can be provided, even if you spend more money, you must find a suitable place if the conference of the newspaper union opens. No, everything that happens today will become a shame for the George family and will exacerbate the voyeurism of the outside forces to the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night when he returned to the manor, he accidentally saw Arthur’s car in the parking lot, a gold-plated gold car he bought more than two years ago. The car was named "Haussian Golden Dragon" by the manufacturer and Arthur. It is also the same in the whole emperor. He used 320,000 to be custom-made from House Motors. The seventy-nine gold alloys, when the sun is good, open on the road to render the buildings on both sides of the street golden. Only such an exaggerated high-profile car can be opened by Arthur, and only he dares to open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, Mr. John said a few words to him, the tone was very heavy, and the car was thrown into the garage by him, and he never took it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect to be here today, Mark saw the car again. When he got off the bus, he frowned. Now it is time for the George family to face a huge difficulty. In the past, they will continue to rule the entire newspaper industry. If they step forward, decades of hard work will become a stream, nourishing those "dry". The land. What needs to be low-key, not high-profile at this critical juncture, is that Arthur drove the car in the city and will make more people feel disgusted with the George family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a "subtle" city. There are too many big people living here. They don’t dare to be high-profile. A guy who doesn’t know how to be so arrogant will give They bring a very bad influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark regained his gaze into the manor’s building, butler’s stiff smile and bowed his head, and Mark handed him the jacket, “Arthur Let him come to see me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is in the master's bedroom...", the feet in the butler's eyes suddenly stopped, and he hurriedly took his steps. Followed by Mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark looked at him sideways, his expression a little strange, "You said he was in his father's room? What did he go there?", with Mr. Arthur and Mr. John The relationship, he can never be kindly to see Mr. John and hope that he can turn over, on the contrary, he will curse Mr. John's return to the embrace of God. Suddenly it seemed to be what I thought of, and Mark ran wildly toward the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is guessing, what will Arthur be doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Mr. John’s life is maintained by sophisticated medical devices. Once one of the machines has a problem, there is no doubt that Mr. John is very likely to become “ Past tense". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bastard, maybe you can really do something like this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he slammed open the door of Mr. John’s bedroom, the eye-catching picture made him unable to believe his eyes, Arthur sat in bed On the side, holding Mr. John's hand, his old hand is tightly attached to his cheek, and there is a sorrow in his eyes, just like another person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did this git thing have such a human side, is he finally awake? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark went to the medical devices and roughly checked the operation of these devices to ensure that no one had a red light, he was loose. In one breath, the muzzle softened a little more subconsciously. "You didn't say hello to me." He touched Mr. John's forehead and was very warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur’s face was stunned and he retorted, “This is the father’s manor, not your manor. I don’t have to say hello to you, you think Do you have this qualification?" Arthur’s face showed a deep sarcasm. "Father is not dead, you are not a homeowner!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest about Arthur Being able to say such things shocked himself. He never thought that he would say such things one day. It was precisely this that made Mark think that Arthur was awake and knew the importance of Mr. John to the whole family. He turned his head and turned away without anger and laughter. Now he knows how to care for his father. What did he do before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mark left, Arthur’s expression looked very complicated and looked at Mr. John’s quiet and kind face. He suddenly found himself as if he hadn’t looked so carefully for a long time. After this man, in his impression that this man is still more than 30 years ago, there is a kind of momentum that is not angry and powerful, so that he does not feel fear all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered a lot of things, remembered the first time when he was a child, the first time to swim, the first time to climb. He never worried about his own behind, just keep moving forward, because he knows that behind him, there is a person who protects himself silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did the feelings between them become rusty and become like enemies? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur gently stroked the large age spots on Mr. John’s face, how bright it was once, now not only wrinkles, but also this terrible Spots. He wants to smooth out those wrinkles, but he can't do it because he is not almighty God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the age of fourteen or five, the George family looked down at the newspaper as the noon sun, and Mr. John wants to actively expand the family business and intends to enter the printing industry. The industry thus neglected his discipline. In the family, those uncles and uncles began to care very much about him, taught him how to spend money, how to enjoy, how to use his position to bring everything he hoped for, and succeeded in making him a loser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then what he is facing is no longer a caring father's love, but constant criticism, scolding, and punishment. He was fed up with Mr. John to manage his life. He was fed up and needed to study hard every day. He was fed up at five in the morning and got to the office at seven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crack between the two has gradually become an abyss that cannot be crossed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur’s emotions suddenly got out of control, and he whimpered on Mr. John’s body, tears soaked the sheets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that he has done a lot of wrong things, but can you now regret it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too late! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sneak peek at Arthur’s mark through the door and sighed with a sigh of relief, though Arthur’s regret was a little late. But it is better than not knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, father." Just as Mark turned around, the tearful Arthur looked up and the palm climbed up to the transparent tube around him. Tightly squatting, he looked at Mr. John’s calmness as if he was asleep, waiting around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minutes later, he let go of his hand, wiped his tears and kissed Mr. John’s forehead and left the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Arthur gently closed the door, Mr. John, who was supposed to be dead in bed, suddenly opened his eyes. He took off the mask of the ventilator, and his face was gloomy and dripping water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to his panic, his eyes could not accommodate anything. Until now he could not believe that his youngest son actually wanted to kill him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this bastard really did it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. John, who never thought he was a loser in life, suddenly had an unspeakable pain in his chest, and he lost. Lost to life, lost to himself, but soon his expression became firm. Now is not the time when he feels his life, the family is facing a storm, first stabilized the situation, he has time to teach him Son, how to respect his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Mr. John just knew that the feature was burned after he was actually comatose, but he soon woke up. He told the doctor not to tell anyone, on the one hand, to test the performance of the two sons, Mark and Arthur, after "losing" his father. On the other hand, he hoped to give some potential enemies through his own coma. Come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it seems that the plan is very successful, but the success is a bit too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it’s not when he wakes up, he still has to wait, waiting for Mark to be in the press conference when he meets at the venue, he is from the bed Sitting up is more meaningful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give the enemy the heaviest blow with a fist, you first need to take your fist back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Mark asked the presidents of newspapers from all over the country to come to the manor. Since this conference can’t find anyone who is willing to undertake, then Just open in the open air. The friends of those families chose to wait and see at this critical moment, which made Mark very chilling and realized the ruthlessness of capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, people communicate not about feelings, money, connections, but power, but no feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are popular, everyone will flatter and say good things, I hope you can bring them together to make a fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are down, these people will be ready to stand on the side of the knife and fork, waiting for you to be on the table to become food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
