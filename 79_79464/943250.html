			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunt is the journalist of the Empire’s new newspaper, and is 33 years old this year. It is a good time for young and strong. His ancestors were also aristocrats. When he was in his grandfather's generation, he was in the wrong direction because of the station team problem. He became a victim in the court battle, and was deprived of the nobles' title and became an ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if it’s normal, it’s definitely not something that ordinary people can compare. The accumulated wealth of more than two hundred years makes this ordinary person’s life still Yes, they waited until the New Party came to power and they finally ushered in the spring of turning over. The wealth and connections accumulated in the past have finally come into play. His father has also become a well-valued capitalist, operating two factories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he, contrary to his father’s wishes, did not learn how to manage the business, how to grow the company, secretly holding a tuition fee, a very famous The special feature reporter is a teacher and learns how to become a good reporter. His dream is to use the pen in his hand to reveal the truth of the world through the medium of the newspaper and let people see a real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his father’s personal connections and wealth, he did a good job in the journalist industry, especially after the George family finished, lost the monopoly industry. The capital, the newspaper industry also ushered in a major reshuffle. The cruelty of this shuffling made many people think of the comfort of the George family when they faced bankruptcy. Many newspapers have not experienced such a war. They have long been used to taking money to buy news and then publish it to earn the benefits of subscription. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don’t need to know what brains, just buy news → typesetting → sale, there is no competitive problem, this kind of comfortable life makes many newspapers When faced with a huge change in the newspaper industry, they can only passively go to war because they simply do not know how to enhance the competitiveness of their newspapers, how to protect themselves while killing their opponents, and how to get to a higher position in this field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are also some newspapers that stand out from these people, and the Emperor New Sharp is one of them. The newspaper was formed by a group of young people with dreams and pursuits, with an average age of less than 30 years old. Hunter invested 50,000 yuan, accounting for 35 percent of the shares. It is reasonable to say that he only needs to sit in the office to review the daily press release, but he prefers to be on the front line compared to this boring job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it is his attitude of taking the lead in the front line, so that the atmosphere of the Emperor's new newspaper is very good, very energetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time someone wrote an anonymous letter to him, which introduced some insider stories about the Nam Lindes attack in the previous period. According to the official statement, a group of gangsters who had flown to the Nam Lindes in order to retaliate against the police chief, caused a large-scale attack. More than 10 people were killed in the attack, including the police station. The mayor, Todd, was implicated and transferred to other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the letter says that the time of the attack stems from the struggle between the two forces, and it is faintly revealing the relationship between Nano Lindes and Otis. The conflicts between the conflicts make people think about each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his sensitivity to news, he immediately realized that if the anonymous letter says it’s true, once it’s sorted out, it’s enough to shake The whole world. What makes him even more excited is that he is very likely to get a grand prize - the George News Award. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you set up such a news award three months ago, many people won’t be the same thing, but after three months, people have already Beginning to cherish the days of life and money, and the awesome life of Mr. John's legend, this award has surpassed the original news gold award and became the most recognized industry award in the newspaper industry and the news industry. In addition to the generous bonuses, it is even more important to bring a great reputation. I heard that as long as you can get the best news award three times in a row or eight times in a row, you will be able to get a lifetime certificate signed by Mr. John before his death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be recognized by a tycoon who once monopolized the newspaper industry. This kind of honour is very exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So under the influence of many factors, Hunt came to the city of Nano Lindes. The first reaction after he arrived here was to look back at the station logo he was out of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been here before, probably four years ago, he followed his teacher, an outstanding journalist from the special publications came here to interview the then mayor Todd, the content is about Nano Lindes becoming an important transportation hub in the middle of the empire and the economic impetus generated by the surrounding cities. A very formal interview, when he came to Nal Lindes, the whole city was like a huge stove, and you can see busy people everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now... there are still a lot of people on the street, but they are already infinitely tending to an ordinary city. There is no tension on the faces of these people. Worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Hunter was a staff member of the City Hall. He called the guy and called him to talk about it in the restaurant where he had eaten once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little more than six o'clock, the staff of the town hall appeared in the restaurant, he wore a hat, the cap pressure was relatively low, if not he went to Henry At this table and sit down, maybe Hunt can't recognize him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now the City Hall is getting out of work so late?" Hunter took the initiative to pour a cup of tea for the other party. "I helped you order a double-baked roast." There are appetizing soups and fruit granules. If you have what you want, wait for the waiter to come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man nodded and took off his hat. It reveals the face of a middle-aged man in his forties. He has a pale blond hair, his hair doesn't look very good, he looks a little embarrassed, and he has deep eye bags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ripped off the neckline tie and finally sighed with relief. "Is there any interview task this time? Or come over to play?", he made a laugh. It looked very stubborn, which made Hunter feel a move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the diners who were not around, and whispered: "Someone told me that the attack on Nano Lindes was not as simple as the official said. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy opposite him snorted and stood up immediately. "Mr. Hunt, this joke is not funny, if you are here for this matter." , then you may be disappointed, and I don't know anything, I am leaving..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunt grabbed his arm, "I am very Sincerely, this news is very important to me, what do you want?" From the reaction of this guy, Hunt knows that the anonymous letter says it is true, otherwise the other party will not be so sensitive, which also makes He is even more excited. The mayors who broke out of the two cities smashed each other like gangs, enough to make the whole world shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can imagine that the new party’s face will be lost, more places will explode more scandals, and gradually form a wave of public tsunami, and he In addition to the achievement of glory, he can also give his father the appreciation and recognition of those old party members. Maybe their family still has the opportunity to re-enter the political arena and reproduce the glory of the ancestors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Hunter and his father, and even the entire family, are advocates of the old party camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man pumped his arm and did not pull his arm out. He looked at Hunt. "I really don't know about this. You should ask other people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Twenty thousand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, after listening to it, this is not a question of money, this is..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirty thousand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Fifty thousand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Hunter reported a price of 50,000, the man obviously hesitated, according to the currency signed by the Empire and the Federation last month. The Normal Memorandum of Understanding contains questions about the currency exchange rate between the two countries. The Imperial Cabinet and the Federal Parliament have reached a high degree of agreement. No matter how the financial order of the Western world changes, the exchange rate of the Imperial Star to the Federal Shield will be nailed to a ratio. Four on this exchange rate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five thousand is enough to exchange 200,000 federal shields, so that he can have a good day in the federal side, have a little spare cash to invest in some industries, or do it yourself Point business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the process of his hesitation, Hunter reported the price of 100,000, completely defeating his psychological defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, since the attack, the atmosphere in the city hall of Nam Lindes is very subtle, no one likes to have a dragon lying next to him, or that A kind of dragon that will eat people. This time unfortunately Todd and his hardcore supporters, who will be next time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blanen personally went to Otis to meet Du Lin, the news brought back is not very good, maybe he thinks so good, but these staff in the town hall Billumin is much more "smart", an industrial city is never as good as the former Nano Lindes model, and even worse than the current Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus these people who know the inside story have been asked to keep their mouths shut, and their road to promotion is obviously cut off in the future. It can be said that there is no hope in the future. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can jump out with a sum of money at this time, it might be a good choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
