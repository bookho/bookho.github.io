			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin and the girl did not idle when they went out for a date in the afternoon. He chatted with several old friends about Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure you can let him move in the direction you want?", Barr sitting in an art sofa yawned, suddenly The exhaustion made him a little sleepy, and then explained it a little. By the way, he complained that his private time was disturbed. "I should be taking a nap at this time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;马Gus smiled and didn't talk. He and Barr were old friends for many years. They had already known each other since they were only in their teens. It has been a very rare thing to keep a good relationship for so many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friendship between the nobility has never had a shelf life. For two generations, the two families may choose to fight because of the distribution of some interests, or they may be hostile. For a long time, the two families have become new partners because of some aspects. Aristocrats who have been able to maintain their friendship for decades like Magus and Barr are very few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interest is the main theme in the aristocratic society, friendship is not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other people in the room, one in their fifties and one in their sixties. They are all the same age of Magus, and basically They were all aristocrats born in the same era, and they all looked at Magus at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introducing Doolin into the aristocratic circle is something that Maggs has been working hard. Although he does not want to admit it, it is undeniable that Du Lin is indeed a young man. The key to excellence is that he did not have any resources, and he really started from scratch. Regardless of whether he used brilliance in this process, at least he is now up. If he gives him more resources at the beginning, is he likely to do better? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obvious, Du Lin is a young man who will seize the opportunity and take advantage of opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On these foundations, he also has this huge ambition as his driving force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as seven or eight months ago, after Dooling rejected Magus’ proposal to introduce him to the nobility circle, Magus’s first thought was Find the deadly weakness of Doolin and hang him on the penalty platform. Once the empire is currently in control of the leadership, the loyal empire politicians are old, dead, and there are not many new generations of successors who can confront Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin’s climate has begun to take shape, allowing him to continue to develop for 20 or 30 years, and when they are all dead, those people may not really be able to suppress Du Lin’s ambitions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason he doesn’t dare to move now, he actually knows very well that he is too young and weak in the face of this empire, showing his own indiscriminately. The ambition of desire will only make him leave early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when he is strong, when he is in his forties and 50s, he has more powerful and unpredictable power, he may be able to It is possible to make things that alarm the world, whether it is to silently turn the empire into a toy of his palm, or to gain power through more rude means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Magus had a plan at the time to wait for the start of the general election to take Du Lin down and not give him a chance to stand up. He will not leave a huge hidden danger to the successor of the empire, and then create some stupid plans to give the problem to future generations to solve and test whether they are qualified to test whether the successor is really qualified. This is not a qualified politician. Things that should be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every danger should be annihilated in the nascent state of control, leaving trouble to future generations is actually an incompetent performance, because they do it themselves When you arrive, you have to excuse yourself. Of course, this is definitely not invisible to anyone. After all, the world has entered a great new era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus’s evaluation of Dooling is very pertinent. If the bastard is willing to play according to the rules of the game, he will become the leader in the new generation, as long as He is single-minded for the strength of the empire, and the future may not have the day of mastering the scepter. But if this bastard is for his own lust, then let him go to hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s timely change was also unexpected by Maggs, who thought that Du Lin would realize that the problem was near the election. I didn't expect him to find these problems at least a year in advance and then changed his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also illustrates the excellence of Doolin, who is very sensitive to the dangerous sense of smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Marcus’s discussion with a few old friends here is about whether to bring Doolin into the aristocratic circle. If they disagree, Du Lin’s plan will be finished, and only they all agree, and Du Lin can really pass the threshold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and said, "I still have to live for another ten years. It should not be a problem. In this decade, as long as Doolin does not make things that harm the interests of the Empire, he will soon be assimilated by us. Of course We also need to make some changes in the policy so that he can recognize us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The young people in this group can exceed Du Lin in political and personal abilities. There are not many people. We also need to consider another situation. If there is no Doolin, can our successors be able to ensure the safety of the empire and ensure the security of the current system?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of Magus are indeed very profound. The Yaoxing Empire has too many outstanding figures in their generation. It is because of their existence that the national strength of the Yaoxing Empire is constantly The enhancement of its status in the international are constantly rising. Once this batch can be said to be the most elite ruler in one or two hundred years, the successor is not good enough, even if it is difficult to do it, what will the empire do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no optimism about the future because of the current situation. The international situation is constantly changing. Today everyone must maintain a respectful attitude toward the empire, maybe tomorrow. Someone stood up and wanted to challenge the authority of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus there is a federation around, this group of small businessmen who died in the heart of my empire is not dead, once they let them find the opportunity, they definitely can’t Under the mercy. By that time, there were not three or five powerful people in the empire to suppress the situation, and the situation would become very dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have a lifetime of life, always leaving a guarantee for future generations and the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is not to say that there is no dulining at all. In the past many years, Du Lin has not come the same every time, but people always To pursue the best, Du Lin is a very promising person. No one can ignore the development of him from nothing to ten years. When he entered the city from the countryside that year, he was only a half-year-old boy. Now he has developed into the peak of personal power. If such a person gives him more On the stage, he will certainly be able to achieve even greater achievements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar said a very disappointing statement at this time, "If you are dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magus laughed aloud. "No one can look after this country and those young successors forever, even God will die, let alone us. As for what we will become like after we die, the relationship with us is no longer Big. We gave them the best foundation, but they can't grasp it. Even if one day they go out of the country, it is their sin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the guar dynasty that was so powerful that the whole world was shivering? The first king led the ten heroes to sweep across the northern continent under the glory of the gods. No one can withstand the sharpness of the Guars. Countless temples will be burned, countless aliens will be enslaved, and the first king and the ten heroes will be gualt. The dynasty laid the best start, they have tried their best, can the successor not work hard and what is the solution? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Ogildins, they had a nightmare start, but they won, they got freedom from the Guars, and then step by step It is almost necessary to unify the entire continent. Of course, in the history books, the Ogildinians unified the entire continent. All the effects, including the alliance at the time, showed their surrender. Some small countries also accepted the royal seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, how? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The times will always move forward again, will not look back, we can only do the best things now, as for later, that is their business! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, the other three gave a reply to the agreement. Doolin is indeed the most potential but also the most dangerous young man, Magus. Confidence can turn him over and change him from a person who is dangerous to the empire to a person who will protect the empire in the future. Then they don't have to entangle themselves on this issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggs can do it, whether Doolin is right, how to test the final results, that is the things of those people in the future. They left the strongest shield, but in case these people turned the shield into the sharpest spear to kill themselves, it was not their fault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as a risk in the world, and there is never a risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this foundation, Du Lin passed an invisible "exam", and perhaps he had some guesses before he would choose from Magus. As a breakthrough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it’s like a farce. The official propaganda of the empire is that the destiny of the country is in the hands of every citizen. Sometimes the truth is always It is so unexpected that the fate of the empire will always be in the hands of a very small number of people. How can this kind of power be mastered by ignorant civilians? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the time when Magus returned home, Du Lin had already waited for him to have a moment, and Du Lin was chatting with the wife of Magus about cooking. It can be seen that Magus's wife is very attentive, and still holds a small book to record some of Durin's top secret formulas. It seems that he intends to use these things in practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
