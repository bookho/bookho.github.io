			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the office, all the newspapers have news about the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The George family is now dead, and John is accused of illegally manipulating the newspaper industry and gaining huge economic benefits, which has been temporarily restricted to the Imperial First Prison. Inside, waiting for the court. Mark, the next generation of homeowners who were highly hoped and very thoughtful by Mr. John, are still in the custody of the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the destruction of the feature society, the entire George family was heartbroken and had almost lost their original function. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the George family, without the feature society, is this empire’s newspaper industry finished? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impossible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as a wise man or a wise man in the world. There are so many smart people, and almost no one can count. At such a moment, the Canarys newspaper industry, which had just died from the prosecution, once again launched the slogan of forming a "news league", and almost all newspapers began to dig the corner of the George family. Those expatriate journalists are the best resources, they are willing to provide more commissions, more subsidies, as long as these people are willing to quit, or provide them with press releases. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the promotion and isolation of those tycoons are from the top of the blade, then these people’s behavior is the bottom of the front, and may not feel at first. When I arrived, I was too late to find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin asked the City Hall to publish these press releases by phone and gave them a certain amount of compensation, and also suggested that they did not have to pay for the news. Money, there may be profits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, under the influence of a few dozens of pieces to a hundred gold bullets, the entire empire has a little bit of fame and reading. News. It is not important to have a map. The important one must be in the first edition, the first one, referred to as the front page headline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin, who should have been happy, did not see much happy face on his face, because he had a token in his hand and a token of five dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fourth day of full business in Otis. Last night, the third day, his token company and all investors and merchants holding tokens made a third cash settlement. Visitors who came to Otis from the outside in three days contributed a total of 5,11.9 million imperial stars to the city. Originally this should be a happy thing, but when it was time to carry out the token order, someone found about 3,000 tokens with the same number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tokens are not much different in appearance from the tokens that Du Lin casts, except for some details that may be slightly slight, you can say It is exactly the same. But he can still find that these tokens are fake, not just the serial number problem, but the anti-counterfeiting technology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Durin's tokens are treated with special processes. When these tokens are combined with twins, a slight amount of twin reaction occurs. That is, steam. He did not disclose this to anyone, just to ensure that tokens are not forged as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not very likely that people will not be forged. After all, even the Empire’s currency is cost-effective, not to mention such a seemingly low-tech token. What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three thousand...", he shook his head. "Yesterday may be three thousand, then today may be 30,000, the day after tomorrow is 300,000. "Three million or even 30 million." He slowly stood up and walked to the window. The bustling city did not show any difference because of the three thousand pieces, but Du Lin knew that some people could not sit still. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people in the office, and three others, Buddha, Hite, and a casino owner yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Check it out, quietly check, these three thousand pieces are just test the water, once they find out that we are not sure that there are counterfeit coins in the warehouse, they will not be able to control Your own greedy and stupid desires. Don't look up those who use tokens, check those who sell or pass on to passers-by. I believe these people must exist, find them, follow them, I want to know who I want to challenge me on my site!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has a hunch that this person, or this organization is definitely not a small force, because small It is impossible for the forces to do the token template in such a short period of time, as much as possible with the same weight. This requires a lot of financial and human resources to support, the printing equipment is not cheap, and it is not very good to buy, the other party must have a big plot. There are already several speculations in his heart, but now that it will disturb the thinking and direction of these people, so he has to wait, and those people can't help but jump out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His orders made it difficult to find out that their characters were acting on weekdays. They had no clear goals. They were dressed exactly like foreigners. They kept wandering around the station and around the city circle, looking for Du Lin to tell them. The clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott is a member of a fellowship and a staff member of the security company. He wears bells and whistles at the request of Keena. Looking at the suitcase with a gaze. This is the second day of his mission. Gina told them who found the person they were looking for and whose salary doubled. This is what Du Lin confessed. Therefore, he not only has a desire for money, but also with respect for Doolin, and constantly appears and disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when he thought that there might be no gains today, when he took the trolley and walked toward a booked hotel, a man suddenly pulled Lived with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry to interrupt, do you know where the token can be exchanged for cash?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Pulling him is a very ordinary young man, sweating, in his early 20s, Scholt answered this simple question, "You can go to the token company to exchange cash, but There are a lot of people in these days, you have to wait for a while.", he said he was leaving, but the man took him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked at the watch and said anxiously, "Hey, man, my father is sick, I have to go back, I can’t redeem it. I have it here. ......", he took out a pocket specially used for tokens. There is a reed at the bottom of the pocket. You can take one out at a time, or you can open the pocket and take it out. He counted it. "I have one hundred and four dollars here, I will give it to you. You will give me ninety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott The eyes lit up, "No problem..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked into the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in a private space on the fourth floor of a casino, several well-dressed men sat at the gambling table, surrounded by their side. More or less young girls, holding wine for them, holding smoke or paradise. These people are looking at the cards in their hands, and from time to time will put a bunch of ordinary people who will not be able to earn money for a lifetime, and understate the push to the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game was over, and when everyone took a break, they came in again with a dealer, replacing the dealer just now, "Respected Your guests, good evening, then I will issue a license for you. If you have any requirements, please tell me that the casino will do its best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-aged old man sitting in a high-backed chair frowned and asked, "What about the man?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you and your guests The time has lasted for two hours, and my colleague is a little bit physically weak. According to the rules of the casino, the dealer will be changed every two hours. If you still want my partner to deal with you, I will ask him Come back, continue to host the game for you.", the dealer is not humble, the answer is polite, the old man who frowns frowns and waved his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical strength? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as the dealer used to sort out the chips for these guests and found that the tokens with a denomination of one hundred and five hundred yuan are slightly different. He quietly buckled a chip and is now on his way to the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this chip is fake, he may get the biggest bonus he has ever had in his life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm is not so violent, but there is always thunder in the subtleties! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, the Buddha’s spirit came back from the outside. He had a blue bag in his hand, and the dilidanglang’s sound of a chip crash. He sat down on the sofa and picked up the apple on the coffee table and slammed a few mouthfuls. He groaned and said vaguely: "The guy is called Coster, the Westerner, who has been in the nano-Lindes for the past few years. There is a loan shark over there, but it seems that he is not the person we are looking for. Do you want to see him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s face finally showed a smile He patted his legs and stood up. "What are you waiting for??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to the outskirts, Buddha told Du Lin that these two days were A total of more than a dozen lines were caught in the city, but most of these lines point to different homes. These people have already been identified, and they have no ability to suddenly do such a business, indicating that they are just dismantling their homes. The real behind-the-scenes black hand has another person. Compared to other people, Coster is obviously the most suitable to be caught, because his private life is very chaotic, and no one will be surprised if he disappears for two or three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hayyard of the outskirts, Du Lin saw Mr. Coster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
