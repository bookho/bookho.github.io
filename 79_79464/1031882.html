			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl returned to the office to make the manager very curious, he thought it would take more time to let the suspect stay here, but did not expect The girl left the other party in just one minute. Just now he had contacted the city's investigation bureau by means of hands-free, and he was assured that he could see them outside the bank after five minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the investigation bureau will not enter the bank to arrest people. This is the result of mutual compromise between the imperial central bank and the cabinet. If the police or the investigation bureau are allowed to enter the bank, Grab people, this will cause the bank to lose a lot of money - the money stored in the anonymous account if no one has access for a long time, in the end is basically equal to the bank's pocket. Every year, at least tens of millions of illegal funds are swallowed by banks. A large number of account owners may be in jail, and a small number of owners have absconded, and finally about 5 percent of the anonymous accounts are closed. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very popular for those imperial client empire central banks, although far less popular than those who go to see God’s account, it’s possible that these people’s jail After ten or twenty years, even in this life, there is no expectation. The money they have in the bank is equal to the money in the bank’s own pocket. How to use it if you want to use it. As for those customers who can be released in a few months or two or three years, they probably don't have much money in their bank accounts, not the type that banks like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this era of inflation that has been visible to the naked eye, there are now one million and ten years, twenty years or fifty years after the bank One million is definitely not a concept. Now one million can buy several buildings, but after fifty years, one of the buildings in a building may not be able to afford it. When these people come out to use the money for a long time, the bank is also very happy to give them, after all, to take care of the credibility of the bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you tell him?", the manager pressed one hand on the back of the chair, leaning his legs and looking very impatient," How long is he willing to stay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl looks very wronged and bows her head, with some smile in her voice. "He gave me some money, let me I must find a way to get his things done, so you are embarrassed, I will come to discuss with you to see if there is any way to help him get this done.", said her nervous questioning, "This I paid for myself, or did I leave it to the investigation bureau when he was taken?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager touched his chin. This monitored account involved 2.15 million illegal funds, and the other party demanded that all of them be transferred immediately. This guy must have violated a serious economic crime or has been wanted. These people care about the change that can not be found in the imported pockets. They care about when they can leave the empire and when they can enjoy the wealth of their crimes outside the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these things have never been so stingy for things that can be done with a little money, and managers are very experienced in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the bank manager has a lot of ideas. In fact, only for a short time, he lowered his voice and said, "Give me 20%, I will investigate this matter." The person in the bureau said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl with the thumb of the nail licked the joint of the index finger, the pain could not stop her from laughing and excited, she nodded again and again. Continue to face the ground, not let the manager, and the person outside the office see the expression on his face, "No problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager said I couldn't help but ask, "What is the 20%?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The two played a show again. The security guard outside the bank told the manager via radio that his "guest" had arrived and the manager had signed his name on the remittance slip. It looked very unsatisfactory. The money order was thrown to the ground, and stood up a few steps, with a particularly harsh expression on his face, as if he was yelling at the girl. The girl bent down and picked up the money order and then left her head with her head down. When she came back, she was grievous, and her eyes were red. I don’t know when it would flow out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, happiness is about to cry, but this time it seems to be aggrieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., you have already done the work for me, but if you go to the federal side, you need to wait until the 25th of this month to be able to withdraw this." Money, do you think it is ok?”, the girl also explained to Mr. Roel that the 25th of each month is the settlement date of the imperial central bank and the three major federal banks. These remittances that are not planned must wait until the settlement date. It will then be remitted to the federal bank account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roel nodded and stood up. He held out his hands and held the girl’s hand and shook it hard. "Thank you, I I don't know what kind of vocabulary I should use to express my gratitude. If I have the chance, I hope we can meet again!" He lifted his hand and held the hat and lifted it slightly. "Then I will leave, goodbye, Ms. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl smiled and watched Mr. Roel leave the bank, then quickly walked into the bathroom, and she locked herself in the cubicle of the toilet, unable to suppress the laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Mr. Roel is very generous, and in addition to the money, he gave another gift to her, just in their second contact. time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl sat on the toilet and looked at the golden dolphins held by both hands, and the breathing became rushed. She can feel that this dolphins have at least 50 grams, or a little more, which is another generous income, and only belongs to her income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is her lucky day, so in less than half an hour, she actually earned a thousand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, Mr. Roel immediately put on his sunglasses after leaving the bank gate. He followed the sidewalk to the nearby bus station. He did not purchase it in the city. Cars, there is not so much cash to buy a car. The power of the doorman is so great that he can easily find out where his account has been cashed, which is one of the reasons why he dare not do false certificates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has always heard that the door peasant has contact with many gangs, if he makes a fake passport message, or if he wants to sneak a message, he will pass it to the doorman. In the ear, he is likely to be caught by these people and sent back to the west. Some time ago, he appeared in the newspaper several times. He didn't dare to take the risk. The ghost knew if the doorman had already let his friends start paying attention to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason... In fact, he does not know where to make fake passports and documents. How can he know the high-ranking elites who walked in the eyes of people's eyes all the time, how can they know the garbage that hides in the sewers and makes a small amount of money through illegal means? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when he was about 50 meters away, suddenly someone pushed him from behind him, pushing him to lose his focus. Hey fell to the ground. Then he felt a very powerful sole squatting on his back, his hat and sunglasses were also hit, and a guy in a trench coat looked down at his hair and put his The head is raised, "Mr. Roel, you were arrested!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Mr. Roel’s thoughts are gray, but there is also one to be thankful The thing that is that the person who catches him is not the person of the door, the official person. This will at least not let him die quickly, maybe he will face long periods of imprisonment, but as long as his money is still there, everything is not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
