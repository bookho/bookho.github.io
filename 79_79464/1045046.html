			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra frowned slightly, "But this is in conflict with our current plan, we are going to knock out the doorman, and some preliminary plans are already in operation. This will make us lose our integrity and may suffer losses.”, Sandra squinted at the back of the doorman. “If we appear on this project, will Dulin’s project appear? Question?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos ordered a cigarette. He shook his head with a slight smile. "The reason why Du Lin persuaded us was that the doorman was bloody. The people at dawn, I went back and checked the information. This organization has assassinated many nobles, including the top nobles such as the Duke and the Prince. If the Mennon is really a bloody dawn, no matter what conditions he proposes, I will not agree. But you probably know a little about this time, but there are some things you don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The doorman has already turned to the new party, he is not A list was given before the release of the crime, All of them are members of the Scarlet Dawn organization. He has broken with those people, otherwise he will not be released without sin. According to the current situation, Du Lin’s theory is actually untenable because the Mennon does not Then there is the person with bloody dawn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos is the agent of Bondika in the west, and the Bondika Military Group and the military have very close commercial cooperation. Any military group that wants to get a large order is not able to produce weapons with excellent performance, but also needs a large number of big people to help them speak. Carlos himself and the military have maintained close ties. After this time the peasant was imprisoned by the military, he did not do anything on the surface. In fact, he had already contacted his friend in the military and got it from the military. Some insiders of military operations, some of which have questions about the doormen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of his inquiry was not to help the doorman, but to know if the doorman had saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a rescue, he will still do nothing, and slowly wait for the situation to become clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he didn't save, he didn't mind stepping on it and then completely falling back to the country club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results are amazing, the doorman took the initiative to cut off all the relationship with the bloody dawn, and turned to the new party, at the expense of selling past comrades, the unprecedented acquisition of the new party Recognition and acceptance. Under such circumstances, Du Lin first proposed that the need for him to get off the stage because of the special status of the Mennon, it is not enough for Carlos to really go to the country club. For him, as a member of the Bondika family, and at the same time an agent in the west, his ultimate goal is the family's power, not a small group in the western part of the barren land to be a land emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Mennon himself has washed away the most troublesome stains on his body, the value of continuing cooperation with Mennon for Carlos is higher than the value of cooperation with Doolin. Because he invested a lot in the front door farmers, and also done a lot of things based on this, these things are all benefits, not just money. The doormen have the acceptance of the New Party. There are many local control areas in the west, and the voice of the governor is also very high. Why do you want to abandon such a very valuable partner, don’t run, and Doolin “restarts”? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the stupid performance of the end of the game, of course, he will not clearly stand up against Du Lin, and Du Lin open contact, he maintains both sides With a certain cooperative relationship, who can bring more benefits to him, he will go closer to who he is. At this point he does not have any psychological burden, because he is a businessman, and he is also a member of the Bondika family, whether it is Du Lin or Mennon, he really wants to tear his face and he is not afraid of who. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Carlos’s words, Clilan has already made a decision. His choice is actually a little less than Carlos. He is just King The minority shareholder of the Mining Group, the manager of the West, has far less power and metrics than Carlos, and is not as free as Carlos. Abandoning a person who has been working together for a long time, and the relationship between them is also very solid. The target who has begun to enter the profit period does not cooperate. Choosing a young man who has just taken the lead, even if he is willing to do so, the board cannot let him mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the only female member of the Country Club, Ms. Sandra, who has been hesitating, her identity, status and power in her hands are not the same as these two guys. Her special identity background does not require her to be too concerned about the binding of the board. It was rumored that she had been dismissed by the group company in order to obtain a Western agent's position and let her predecessor make a major mistake in her work, so that she had the opportunity to go to the top. But in reality, she was actually kicked into the west by the board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orvili Group does not want a woman who can threaten board members to appear at headquarters all day, interfering with their decisions, so she will It is the best choice to send the dark drop to the west. For most people, it is a very proud thing to take charge of the group company's power in the west, but this is just for ordinary people, the resources, capabilities and power that Sandra has are not owned by ordinary people. Come here, it is the real beggar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Sandra is still hesitating, to say that making money..., her purpose is not to make money, she wants to do something, prove Orr The decision of Willy's board of directors is wrong, and at the same time prove to the family that she is excellent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's like a group of gamblers sitting at the gambling table playing cards. The vast majority of gamblers' ultimate goal is to win. They don't care if the cards in their hands are big or small. They only care about the cards in their hands. Go, just a little bigger than the best cards on the outside, so that they can get the money back on the table. But Sandra is not the same, she does not matter whether she wins or loses. The purpose of her playing at the gambling table is to play a pair of the most luxurious and dazzling good cards. Even if she does not win or even lose money, she can accept it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her, working with Du Lin and working with a doorman is like playing cards. From the deck of cards on the left, or from the pile on the right, she needs to make a choice and wait for the moment before the end of the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, she has been working with Mennon for a while, and she used the doorman as a face. He is indeed a good card, but Say how good it is, so good enough to make Sandra happy, not necessarily. The smooth and risky policies and plans made Sandra unable to find the feeling of horror - others were winning or losing, she simply wanted to grab a big name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a cooperation with Doolin, which may give her unexpected gains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A role like Du Lin is not a secret to all three of them, from the day when Du Lin came to the West to stir up, Du Lin The personal experience of the resume is placed in front of their eyes. Very dazzling resume, of course, some people think it is very general, even very bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra feels good, because Doolin is always winning, and the way and means he does things is what Sandra appreciates, maybe Grasping this deck of Du Lin, I can get a board that is much higher than that of the Mennon in the future, and of course it may be very miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the doorman not say that he can pull the low-interest loan from the central bank? I think we should not let the matter go, let him pull the loan, then we With the loan to buy shares, we continue to do things here, and the cooperation with the Mennon does not let go. On the other side, the country club, and the cooperation with Doolin do not stop, both sides maintain relations, if there is any change, we It’s not too much trouble to change positions. What do you say?” Carlos’ decision was definitely not because Dolin was not willing to sell the Aluminium to him. He chose to be the most on his own. Favorable way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalists often show desperate speculation, putting the whole family in an uncertain future, but some people will put the eggs in their hands Every basket I saw myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
