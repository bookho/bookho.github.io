			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Wei is a little insomnia, and when she told her to ask her to choose a pastor and cemetery for her two brothers, she had a hunch, her The two brothers are going to be unlucky. The smart people like Peter can be got rid of them, let alone her two brothers? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the toss and turns, the butler knocked on the door and stood outside the door to tell her that Ede was visiting late at night, and it seems that it is not a good thing, he brought Some people asked if Vivienne would stop Eide from leaving the door or let him come back during the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor’s Office is located in the heart of Ordoto’s city centre. People who have lived here for a long time have represented the nobility and the royal family in this area. Of course, I will live in the middle of my own territory. I have never heard that the nobles’ residences are not in their own territory, but in the wilderness outside their own territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is the city center, it is destined to be prosperous, even in the evening there will be many pedestrians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Weian thought for a moment, shouted, "Let him come in, only allow him alone.", said that he put on a coat and got up, from In the drawer, he took a pistol and put it in the pocket of the jacket. He simply took the hair and walked downstairs to the living room on the first floor waiting for Ed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aidelai's very fast, the sound of the big heel boots and the marble floor hit the night is very loud, Vivian holding a cup of heat Huacha, she blew away the petals floating on the tea soup, took a sip, and even looked at Eide and asked: "Is it too late to forget something that I have not taken away?", she is small Ironic about this brother who has mastered the face-changing technique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aide did not sit down, but looked around. "Where is that Buddha?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Wei’an squatted, put the teacup on the coffee table in front of her, and turned her head toward Eide. She discovered that Ed was a little embarrassed at this time. “What are you looking for? You should not Is it inside the base?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military is not allowed to leave the military base during the non-mission period. This is the iron law, although the Army has set up a number of convenient ways for this. For example, being visited and visiting relatives, but it is also impossible to leave the base, especially the officers, anytime, anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed ridiculed and laughed. "You may not know the little white face you like to plan to kidnap Alex's daughter? Let's say, where is the other person, this time I came here for this. I hope you I can understand that we are the family and hand him over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You scared me!", Vivian looked up at Ed, " He is not here, he left the day before yesterday. If you don't believe, you can look around. I believe that you are as familiar with me here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aide Wrinkle Frowning, isn't he? He stared at Vivian's face for a long time, only to confirm that Vivienne did not lie. When he turned and left, a "brother" behind him stopped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past many years, Vivienne has always called his name. In Ed’s memory, Vivienne will call when he is only ten years old. His brother, she has never called him like that since, including Alex. He turned slowly, and some strangely looked at Vivian, Vivian's expression was a bit complicated, and for a while he squeezed a smile and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have done too much this time, you shouldn’t be like Kevin, it’s not right."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aide suddenly had some irritability. "If you just want to say this, then I know." He was about to leave, and Vivian was out again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Buddha's boss came to Orodo, you have to be careful, my father has left, I don't want you to have something. Some things I can't do. So I can only tell you this, I have been careful recently, you should go back to where you should go as soon as possible, and I will solve the problem with Angela.", facing the family and outsiders like Kevin and Doolin, the final Wei Wei An still chose her brothers who are inclined to her. After all, they are brothers and sisters. There are always things that can't be passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time, Ed heard that there is a boss in Buddhism. In his opinion, the kind of people who live by women are not worthy of careful. The investigation, he asked with some doubts, "Do you have bosses? Who is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aide vaguely felt that there might be something he didn’t know about it. He went to Vivian and sat down, and asked the butler to get him a glass of wine and take another one. Clothes and a medical box come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Vivienne noticed his hand and asked with surprise: "Are you injured?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed nodded, he looked at himself The palm has already swelled two blisters, took a dagger from the waist and punctured the blisters, and then squeezed out the effusion inside. His brow shook slightly. "Well, Alex's daughter was Kidnapped, so I took people to help him. I didn't expect a fire in the middle of the night. I suspect that Kevin is looking for someone. Now that you say this, I understand, absolutely it is called Du Lin, and all Buddhas are not running. "." He glanced at his sister. "You have to remember your identity. Like the Buddha who eats a woman's meal, you can play it, don't touch your feelings."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a bottle of only 50 ml from the housekeeper's hand and poured the liquid into the palm of his hand, taking a cold breath. Alcohol has already started to produce and sell. The first benefit is the powerful family and the hospital with the door, including the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It hurts a little!" It seems that I feel awkward for the breath I just took, and Ed added. He picked up the cup and finished the water and stood up. "Do you know where Doolin lives now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Weian shook his head Eide seems to want to say anything, but said nothing, a rare departure after a good night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation has changed, he has to go back and tell Alex that they are underestimating Kevin, and also to investigate Du Lin, who is vaguely I have heard of this name somewhere, and I can’t remember it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he returned to Alex's house, he looked at the scene that had been blocked and a large number of policemen, and his mind was blank. He pushed the door open and slammed out, grabbed the collar of a policeman closest to him, and asked aloud, "What happened here? Say what happened!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The policeman who was holding the collar was questioning a firefighter. Suddenly, he was restrained by the collar and pressed his hand on the pistol. Before he pulled out the pistol, Ed grabbed his shoulder and took him. Picking up and kneeling on the ground, and kneeling against his chest, "said what happened!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudden assault police let the police on the scene They are all nervous. There has been a murder case here. They are very sensitive. The police officers immediately pulled out their pistols and shouted loudly to let him let go of the policeman who was crushed by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people under Eide’s men saw their chiefs pointed at by guns, and they also took out rifles from the trunk of the car. The scene suddenly became tense. Aite squinted and glanced at the policeman who was confronting the soldiers under his own hands and threw his officer's card out. He took a sigh of relief and stood up. "I am Colonel Eide. What happened here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy director of the police station on the scene cautiously picked up The military officer glanced at it and then went to the telephone booth on the side of the road to call the gendarmerie. After confirming Ed’s identity, he let the guns in his hand be put down and personally returned the officer’s certificate. Ed, by the way, explain it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We found that the owner of this fire-fighting house, Mr. Alex, was cut throat after the room and rescued for a while, but very Unfortunately, he did not take him back from the arms of death." The deputy director was a little sighed because of Alex's special identity, so he appeared here. After learning the identity of Colonel Ed from the gendarmerie, he immediately understood why he was so impulsive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aide’s black body shakes a few times, poor I fell a little. He walked to the forehead and walked to the side of the road with one hand on the end of a car, panting with a big mouth. In his childhood tragic childhood, the only person who can make him feel happy is Alex. The two brothers have worked hard and have cultivated an unparalleled tacit understanding. Perhaps anyone in Aide's eyes is just a symbol, but Alex is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not only his own brother, but also a comrade-in-arms, or a warrior who has been lingering in oppression! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now, he is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I...look at him?", Eide made a request that was not excessive, and the deputy director immediately led Ed to the funeral home. After transporting the car, the car opened a cold air and there was a black plastic bag inside. He tore the Velcro and saw his brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex’s face almost completely lost his blood, and there was a deep visible bone wound in his throat, and the dark red blood solidified into pieces. Tightly attached to the wound, the white throat turned out... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
