			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin·Xima is the third boy in the Xerma family. In addition to his two brothers and one sister, there are three younger brothers below. And two sisters. It can be said that the Xerma family has at least reached the generation of Doolin, and the people are prosperous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unfortunately, Kesma is not a prominent surname with a profound background, the so-called family... but the countryman’s kindness to Mr. Farmer The joke, who made him give birth to so many children? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Du Lin is just a farmer’s son, who needs to do extremely heavy physical labor every day to enjoy a little free time after dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no accident, Du Lin may use a Hummer or two donkeys as a dowry at the age of twenty, and squat in the country where he lives. The face is full of pockmarks, and the woman who is doing the farmer's work is comparable to him, and the woman with thick hands is his wife. Then he will be driven out of his home by his father, with the help of his brothers and sisters, as far as possible near the home, to build a log cabin of his own, and then like his farmer's father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the daytime, as much as possible to open up farming, expand the scope of farming and properly take care of crops that are not so easy to problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, try to be as busy as possible on his wife’s belly, and try to save enough offspring for himself to ease the burden on himself in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all farmers will spend their lives in such a bland life, there may be a little flash in their simple and ordinary life, but the flash is just the sun Under the small unwillingness, it is impossible to notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is something that happens without an accident, and our story begins with a small accident from Doolin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God! How can this be done?", Mrs. Kesma grinning and staring at her eldest son and second son will be unconscious Doolin, who was not awake, dragged it from the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, his head was hurt, and there was a dry blood mark in the forehead. It seems that if he didn’t steal Mr. On the ground, when I met a stone, then he went to the ostrich nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no entertainment in this rural area far from the city, except during the night when the lights are turned off. So most young people put a little free time to drink, gamble and peek at the girl. Of course, if possible, they will also think a little about their stomachs, for example, get some wild food and have a stomach without oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eldest son Mason rolled up his sleeve and wiped the sweat on his forehead. He smiled and said the simple thing. To put it simply, after doing the job, the three people sneaked into the haystack, and a stone that didn’t know where to fly, hit Du Lin’s forehead, and then he’s been comatose until now. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Ma’s eyes shed tears, walked to Doolin’s side, gently helped him to lick his hair, and rough palms groped for Duolin’s tightness. The little face, "My poor Du Lin...", when she looked up again, her eyes became a bit fierce. "Do you know who lost the stone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the country, if a woman has the temperament of "Missy", then she may live less than 30 years old and will be depressed. Don't underestimate the lethality of the countrymen. The highly repetitive and heavy farm work has allowed them to grow a less friendly mouth and far more than the barbarism they have shown.骂街? It’s just an anecdote after a meal, with family as the unit, because some of the little things that can’t be put on the table are the anecdotes that people talk about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason smirked and scratched his head. He didn't see the man. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Mamma took a waste and let the brothers move Du Lin back to his sly bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t ask the pastor or the doctor, they didn’t even get the money, but they needed to wait. If Doolin has not regained consciousness after a day or two, they will invite the only pastor in the town to come here to see Du Lin, or ask the speaker to leak the wind and be diagnosed by a doctor who has killed four teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps in the eyes of the city, this is simply a murder, but in the country, this is the most correct approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you have no last resort, you will never come up with a penny! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin in a coma had a dream, a very complicated dream, in which he saw something strange and savoured something that he could not describe. journey. When a thing called a bullet hit the poor worm, he woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first sentence after he woke up, let the family that has been calm for decades, there has been waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to the city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Xerma sat on his hard wooden chair with his legs crossed, and the cigarettes in his hand burned out. He slammed his last short ass. Throwed on the ground, lifted his foot and grinded it. When he raised his eyebrows again, the members of the family kept a slight bow, a very serious and humble expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma is the real master of this family. Without him, there is no one here. For the ignorant countryside, Mr. Ma’s power is clearly higher than the theocracy and imperial law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...want to go to the city?", Mr. Xerma tried to make his tone less aggressive, in his opinion it was a Very stupid thing. Who can go in the city? If the country is a comfortable place, then the city is hell, it is a magic cave. Every minute, every second, is a torment. In that damn place, it seems as if you need to spend money to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can only be a tramp. If you are lucky, you may encounter a good-hearted charity and fill your stomach. If you are not lucky, it is very likely that the trafficker will catch it and send it to the north to mine. After all, a strong young man like Du Lin is the favorite type of mine owners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Mr. Xerma’s inquiry, Du Lin was very serious and nodded. “Yes father, I am going to the city. I can’t stay here. Everywhere in a lifetime, human life is invaluable. If you can't bloom the most radiant, living is no more comfortable than death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't read, go After the city, you are like a blindfolded scorpion. You can't read the street signs, you can't read the newspapers, and you can't even read the job briefs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ming knows that Mr. Xema is trying his best to stop him, but Du Lin has already determined his determination to leave the country. He can't slowly rot and decay in this place like a corpse, he needs to create his own life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the poor guy in the dream, even if the last wife is scattered, even if there is nothing in the end, even if he finally dies under a thing called a bullet, he will release his own dazzling light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If mediocrity, it is better to die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My father, I know you have your knowledge, but I want to leave here and take a trip. I will fix my shoes and I will repair them. Umbrellas, these are the skills I can live in the city. And I can endure hardships, father, I don't want to pay for it, just give me a place to live, I believe someone will be willing to hire me like a fool.", persuasion Mr. Ma is the only way for Dooling to leave the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A car will pass by this place called Noji Town every week, but it takes money to get on the bus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the big family of Kesma, except for Mr. Kesma’s money, even Mason’s 19-year-old eldest son did not touch After a few dollars, let alone his later guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure you want to leave, leave me and your mother, and your brothers and sisters?", Mr. Kemma's tone is a bit harsh. For the parents who grew up in the country, the most unbearable thing is that the ignorant child refuses his kindness and constantly defies his will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was silent for a moment, stood up and took his belt down. It was made of beef tendon, very strong, and covered with a thick layer of putty. He put the belt on the table, then took off his shirt and squatted on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to implement the family law, then please execute it before I leave!", Du Lin said, "Because I have already made The first and most important decision in my life, I want to leave here and go to the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if I am injured and killed in the city, then It is also the path of my own choice. I respect you, respect you, you have given me life, but I hope that in my life, I can have such a day, let me kill my own future! Father!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final Mr. Xema did not pick up his belt. He rolled two cigarettes in a row and looked at his children from time to time. Although he doesn't have much culture and doesn't know what to do, life gives him the wisdom that human beings should have. When a puppy squats out of the nest, the other puppies will not be willing to stay in the nest. Dooling may not realize that he has changed his mind not only himself, but also his brothers and sisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silent night, no one has the interest in communication, are considering the things that Doolin is about to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large early morning, Mr. Kesma was already sitting at the table outside the kitchen, and he had a small slap in the palm of his hand. Mr. Ma once brought back something when he went to the city. It was once filled with a cigarette with a filter and was regarded as a treasure by Mr. Zema. Later... It seems to be the second year of the New Year. When Mr. Kemas took out the box, he found that the cigarette that was missing was already covered with mold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was annoyed to put the moldy cigarettes in the sun, hoping to be able to rescue some of them, but unfortunately it turned out to be meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, this small iron box became the instrument he used to hold important things, and he was hidden in the hollow under the third plank under the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
