			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you plan to deal with these two children in the future?", Mr. Kesma watched the two children screaming under the siege of a group of old geese. Laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two little mixed balls are not afraid of being in the town, no matter whether they are human or animal, they can’t beat it, they can only scare them. However, this kind of intimidation without substantial harm was very useful at first. The two children gradually discovered that this group of people was not talking about it and finally developed this character. Fortunately, this group of old geese can hold these two children. The fighting power of the old goose is very strong. Three or five old geese can put ordinary The dog fights down, and a group of old geese are not necessarily able to do it. In the past many years, thieves have visited the town of Ziwei, except those who have been found to have disappeared after being caught, and others are repelled by the poultry that have exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every household in the town is raising geese. The reason may be to deal with these two small days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also smiled at the two children who were struggling. At this time, his heart was very comfortable and happy. This is the great fatherly love, deep and mountainous. general. In the face of Mr. Kesma’s question, he did not think much about it and gave an answer directly. “Strive, how much you can get, if you don’t want to do anything and want to inherit my things, I would rather donate it. They will be given a minute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Xema family will not let the waste steal high, do you say yes?", he turned his head and looked Mr. Kesma, the latter nodded and was very satisfied with Du Lin’s answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, no matter what Du Lin took the initiative to give them, or did not give them anything, it is not the best answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former, he and the descendants of the noble lady, including the Timamont family, will be dissatisfied, because in their view, everything that Doolin has is him and him. What the wife has, and these things are also the next generation heirs of righteousness. How can I be satisfied with giving these things to outsiders? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it will inevitably evolve into a third-rate dog-blood brother fight, until one side falls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If nothing is given to them, there will be people who say Doolin’s strange words. These people are mainly from the old brothers and supporters around Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the current stage, these people may not have discovered it themselves, and they don’t realize what, but soon his third child is born and is a boy, these people Will find these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two groups around Doolin, on the one hand, the noble forces with aristocratic background and position, headed by a third child. The other side is a non-aristocratic force headed by these two children. They also have many contradictions and differences between them. If Doolin can't have a stable and controllable solution, the two groups will eventually fight. After his death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin’s answer is a “contention”, and the Guarts will give them more power to give their power, Timamont The family and the nobility will fight to protect the inheritance rights of the third child. As long as Du Lin can calm the water and maintain a neutral attitude, whoever has the best ability will get more things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This society can never be peaceful in a fairy tale, the cruel social competition is enough to let the weak out, the strong is strong, giving the weak more things It is not necessarily love, but it is a kind of frame. Whoever is capable, whoever takes it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone dares to face a black hand here, Doolin will let them understand that greetings from themselves are sometimes not necessarily friendly, or they may be terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma is silent, flashing a terrible light in his slightly squinting eyes, it is clear that the old gentleman already has some thoughts in his heart. . Now that Du Lin has grown up, he has the power, and he dares to be brazen and disobedient. He can't make Du Lin violently like he used to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to get back is to train two talented kids, so that Doolin can understand that when a father is not easy, there will always be some The obedient son made him nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Mr. Kesma glanced at Du Lin with a sardonic look, then hehehehehehehe laughed, laughing Du Lin was inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short time, Alisa also got up, and two bowls of Mairen porridge came from Mrs. Kesma and came over to give the two men. Come breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breakfast in Ziwei Town is actually very simple and simple. It is basically Mai Ren porridge, and the poorness of Mai Ren is almost impossible to find in each bowl. More is meat, beef, dog meat and wolf. Meat or other animal meat. The backward agricultural production system has strong requirements for the physical strength of workers. If you simply eat wheat porridge, you can't afford to take up the heavy work every day. Therefore, meat is the main labor of every family that must be replenished every morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the meat in the bowl, accompanied by the fragrant wheat kernel, has not eaten such porridge for a long time. When he had not left Zizi Town at the beginning... Suddenly remembered that it was still yesterday, everything that happened was vivid, but it has actually passed for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His attention shifted to Mr. Kesma’s horns, and a hint of gray has quietly occupied the bottom of the horns, unwittingly that once dominated Du The man of Lin’s life and destiny is old. Suddenly, he felt a little sad. The years showed the ruthless words. Even the strong ones like Mr. Kesma, which made all the nobles stunned, were late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhat inexplicable in my heart, he suddenly reached out and grabbed Mr. Xerma’s wrinkled old hand, just wanted to say something, Mr. Ksma’s wrist When he shakes, he shakes his hand, then looks at him with a slight head and opens his mouth and spits out a word - roll! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Linhaha smiles, Mr. Kesma or Mr. Kesma, will not change too much because of the passage of time, he has made the world History remembers that there was such a person, then as a hero's son, you must also let history remember the name of Doolin, and the name of Ke Ma! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very relieved to quickly eat the meat in the bowl, drank the porridge, and ran with the bowl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin’s back disappeared into the room, Mr. Xema would turn his head, with a smile on his lips, shaking his head and shaking his head without sound. The minor tune, watching the two grandchildren sinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a perfect day! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Mr. Xiaoxma don’t think so, they just want to steal a few geese for their hens and see if they can Hatching the goslings, and then being inexplicably besieged, two people who are muddy back home can hurt Alisa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take off the clothes, the two little people are all blue and purple, the old goose is enough to let the dog jiliaoliao call for a long time, these two little asshole actually did not cry but there is a species. She blamed Mr. Xerma for not saving the two little guys, and I was distressed by applying ointment to them. The two little bastards just changed clothes and ran out with Fred, but didn’t know Going to somewhere is a disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighing, Alisa stood on the second floor and looked down at Du Lin, who was talking to the Buddha in the downstairs, and glanced at the gram that was holding the chicken coop. Mrs. Sma, and Mr. Xerma, who always has a face, suddenly felt that such a life was actually very good, quiet, no troubles, no sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is so calm, calm enough to kill anyone's ambition! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Dulin and Dufo went to visit Mr. Layton, who was the best member of Doolin’s best shots and personal deterrent. Lin Li’s course is to visit his old lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Layton is not too big as in the past, not tall, a little hunchback, his hands are always behind his back, and he is very kind when laughing. It gives people a feeling of being like a shackle, especially when he is standing with his wife who is like a cow like a cow. It always makes people feel that he must bear the pain that a man should not bear. Things like domestic violence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But actually Mr. Layton is still a very great person. Under his training, Kea has already had better marksmanship than him, and he knows about firearms. And the modification is also very good. Currently, he and Savi are training new employees of the security company at the base in the west. Because of Du Lin’s relationship, he made outstanding contributions in the financial war that ransacked the federal economy for 20 years. The Ministry of National Defense granted him two hundred guns, which means that Du Lin’s name can have two hundred full-armed The "Bodyguard", together with the mine protection team in the mining area, has formed an armed organization of nearly a thousand people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These forces will not be used, and the knife is the most threatening in your hand. If you go out, you may be at risk. - A desperate fight is the last outbreak of human needs for survival. Rabbits and dogs can burst into the potential of ancestors when they die, not to mention people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a simple greeting, Layton’s wife expressed her dissatisfaction with Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
