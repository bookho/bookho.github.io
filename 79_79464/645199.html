			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jon?", Prando looked puzzled at the only name on the expensive stationery, and looked up at the city without knowing it. Mr. Steward of the grown up. Being disturbed early in the morning, waking up from a sweet sleep is not something that makes people feel happy, but more importantly, it is still a day off. If the person who is not knocking at the door is too big, Prando can't wait to retaliate against this damn harasser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown wood grain paper wrapped around a layer of gold rim, which is stamped with gold foil, the paper exudes a touch of aroma, Jon writes two words Some of the artistry, very beautiful. The cost of this stationery itself is extremely high, but it is only used to write a person's name, and all of them show the honor of the host family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, who is this Jon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;facing Prando The doubter Mr. Butler is also very patient. He explained: "Jon is a young man who often goes to the Delil Art Museum. He is about fifteen or six years old. He is very handsome and handsome. His body is strong. The hair is a little bit silvery, very recognizable.", said Mr. Housekeeper's mouth raised the words, "Mayor adults mean to check this person called Jon, figure out his real name, not to be alarmed In his case, check if someone is instructing him behind him. If so, check this person clearly. If not, grab Jon first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, my notice has ended, let me go!", Mr. Guan Jia took the hat and bowed the door after he took the hat. Looking at the back of Mr. Housekeeper's departure, Prando's brow wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very impatient. In fact, it is reasonable to say that his regional police chief and these mayors and parliamentarians are not the same level of characters, they should not be different. too much. But the problem is that for the mayor, for the legislators, the police chief is like their servant, and it is enough to give a command when they want to use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing it, there may not be any rewards. After all, it is a good thing to do in the eyes of those big men. As a police chief, in addition to maintaining law and order. The main job is not to solve the trouble for these leaders? This kind of thing was not encountered twice and twice. Not long ago, Mrs. Vivienne asked him to arrest people. First, it was the turn of the mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite being impatient, Prando has no choice but to implement it. He put on the police uniform that he was going to wear tomorrow, put on his hat, patted his cheek to make himself look spiritual, took a deep breath and rushed out from home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short time, almost everyone knows a message that Prando is looking for a young man named Jon. If someone can provide him with information, he will be blessed and protected by Prando and get a lot of money. For a time, the forces of all sizes were swaying, and began to search for this guy called Jon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside people are searching for Jon in a frantic way, but the real "Jon" is as stable as a mountain in the farm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry!", all of them bowed their heads a little, and he needed to apologize to Doolin because he had done this. Doolin’s request was to pass some information to Mrs. Vivian, and to influence Mrs. Vivian’s judgment. She buried a chess piece in favor of the fellowship at the side of the big man instead of letting him and Wei Wei Mrs. Ann has a feeling. Many people may feel that this thing is not controlled by themselves, but the opposite is true. It is precisely because human beings can reasonably control other emotions, so there will be so many emotional scammers, so there will be so many disappointments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddhas should not have feelings with Mrs. Vivian, and should not let Mrs. Vivian’s pregnancy, the latter is the most terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, all of this can be avoided, but in the tacit understanding of the two sides, things have happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin put his hand on it, to be honest, he is very annoyed now, always want to break something up to vent his heart... grievances? It’s hard to pull a group of bastards, fellowships, and trading companies to this point. Everything is on the right track, and a small accident is very likely to destroy everything he has. He is not a worrying person. The influence and power of the mayor in the city is too great. Before the New Party came to power, the mayor’s old name was the “governor”. The president’s entire city was big and small, and he always grasped the whole city. Power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even today, when the New Party is in power, the rights and power of the "governor" are weakened into "mayor", but it is still not a small businessman. Confrontation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the mayor has caught up with this line, it is inevitable that he will not guess what happened between Buddha and Mrs. Vivian, is there anyone who is manipulating? . Even if he does not think so, as the "East" of the Buddha, it will naturally be accommodated in the scope of the blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
