			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gambling with cash...", a social celebrity looked at his lawyer, "Is it illegal?", his eyes are a bit dazed, There is also a bit of blame. If the agents of these investigation bureaus did not find him with an arrest warrant, he did not even know that he had violated the law! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His private lawyer is a bit embarrassed and is constantly calling for help from his peers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorneys, the representatives of people in the eyes of legal money, behind every case of a rich divorce, means that a lawyer has received a huge commission, especially those well-known Barristers, according to the percentage of the amount involved, draw commissions, regardless of winning or losing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will always live in the spotlight and run counter to the social moral conscience. For the sake of money, these people can sell their souls to the devil, such as the representative character Mr. Kevin. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But people never know what it takes to have such a life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current system of the empire, local governments have great autonomy, especially in law. On the basis of observing the Charter and the Basic Law of the Empire, local governments can also make local regulations with local characteristics by referring to local conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in most cities, brewing private liquor is illegal, but in Irian, as long as you pay taxes, you have legal permission to brew more Alcoholic beverages are legal but are limited to local sale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, Doolin used this law to legally brew alcoholic beverages and legally sold them to those agents in the Irian area, and then the agents were illegal. Through the smuggling channels, these private wines, which were legal but not legal, were shipped to various places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange local laws have always been a very headache for lawyers, and the major law firms have also arranged these situations accordingly. Some people specialize in Raise the laws of a certain state and set up a special office to deal with various situations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some cases will be severely sentenced in some states, but in some states may be acquitted, every lawyer must know some local laws Content to ensure your winning percentage, and to be able to convince customers to put money into their pockets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the lawyer is obviously not clear that it is illegal to use cash gambling in the only city in the city of Otis that can advertise gambling or break the law. behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like telling people that you can sing here, but they don’t tell people what’s behind them – singing here can’t be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After asking several colleagues, the lawyer hung up the phone. He took out his handkerchief and wiped the sweat on his forehead and nodded. "Yes. I have already confirmed that there is such a thing in the local bill of the city of Otis..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the bill that Du Lin submitted to maintain the chip system because of special The regional authorities in the administrative area are directly responsible to the cabinet, so the new law submitted by the city of Otis does not need to be passed by the state legislature, as long as the Ministry of Justice believes that this is not a noisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, this is a less well-known local bill, and it is effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two agents showed a hateful smile on their faces, and they took out the handcuffs, "Sir, if you are not willing to cooperate with our summons , then we can only use the enforcement measures, please don't let us be embarrassed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s statement to Weber is to arrest these people directly, but Weber compromises For a moment, invite them with less tough summoning methods, at least not too offensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about the list of big names on the list, even if Weber decided to hold Du Lin’s thigh, there was a hint of hepatic tremor. If you really offend these people, I am afraid that even if Du Lin takes care of him, he will not be able to continue to be his mayor with peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the sake of others, breaking their own retreat, this is not a smart person to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar things are happening in the offices of the presidents of major companies, or in the offices of some government officials. The sudden outbreak of Weber has made some people realize that even if Chap is dead, this matter is not over, which makes them somewhat upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew that it would be good to not kill Chap. After all, Chap’s mouth is tight enough, as long as he can always close his mouth and investigate the group, they are safe. . At that time, with their influence, dragging this case indefinitely is not necessarily impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if they have to solve the case at the end, they can choose the plan with the least loss. Unlike now, not only does not have no offense, but they also trap themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breakthrough news from the city of Otis allows Du Lin to finally take his attention back from there. The next thing he needs to face is Ambilo. The zeroth poll of the region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poll is a thing that is a group of people doing random interviews on the street, and finally determining the tendency to be investigated, and then using a small group of people to represent the whole The state's position is also a very irresponsible approach. After all, the polling questionnaire of 5,000 people, 10,000 or 20,000 people can't really represent the opinions of the whole state, but most politicians are doing this now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two reasons, the first reason is that everyone is building up strength, the current polls are of little significance, suitable for most of them being represented by a small group, second The reason is still the funding problem. The filling of each questionnaire means the expenditure from one piece to several dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From next year, there will be a poll every month. If there are too many samples, it will waste too many campaign funds for the election team. This is not suitable. It is better to use the money to do the polls, but it may be more effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how others do Du Lin, he needs the most detailed data. After all, this is the first time in life... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s tension is actually necessary, but it doesn’t make any sense. The reason is that people need to know how to be awe. As for the principle of meaninglessness, it’s because He is too rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only providing free educational resources is enough for most people in the entire state to vote for him. The more poor the place, the more important the knowledge is. The more I can't afford to learn. Now Du Lin gives them the only hope, what can they do besides support? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, compared to the investigation gifts of other organizations, Du Lin’s gift is too rich, and Hellsmann once told Du Lin. Giving a certain gift when making a poll will help to improve the tendency of the selected individuals to fill out the questionnaire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are group characteristics of social animals. When most people are biased towards a certain person, it is natural to have a herd mentality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the zeroth poll before the start of the election was very gratifying, and Du Lin led the way with a high support rate of 77.6 percent. There are only two people participating in the governor's campaign list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you can't be proud, Mr. Doolin!" Hellsman reminded Doolin after the poll results came out, "Before the last minute We can't relax. In the past three decades, there have been several times of miracles that can almost be called miracles. Just like you used to slam the lying politicians before the media, lying is not for them. Becoming your own moral burden, as long as you can win, lying is not important!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hersman is very clear about the virtues of those politicians, don't look at the old party candidates now I haven't launched any propaganda offensive yet. It seems that I just came to a cut-off. I want the old party committee to not give up the last hope and effort, but the ghost knows if this guy will make a big news in the last two or three months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said to Du Lin just now, when necessary, lying is just to ensure the correctness of politics. The politicians who lie in the eyes of the people have deceived them. Is a bad villain. However, in the big collective consciousness of political parties, this kind of person who sacrificed personal morality but maintained the victory of the party was worthy of maintenance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are different positions and different perspectives, and the way you look at things naturally is different. It stands to reason that so many politicians who are lying should be finished, but those who are habitually lying and who can recover their image after being seen by people are the real elites. They know this game better than others. How to play, how to win, and more suitable to live in this environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
