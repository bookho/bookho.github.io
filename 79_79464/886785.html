			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not an Odin, this is my country, but not my empire!", Doolin shrugged and walked to the other side. Picking up the cigarette case on the table and taking a squat in his mouth, what he thought of when he was about to ignite, kept his head in the ignited position and continued to say that the cigarette was shaking up and down between his lips. "Because some The betrayal of the traitors, so we lost the last war, if not they may be the kings of the first kings and the gods, and every day will be honored with the flag of red blood."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin looked at Doolin’s face and was dyed red by the flames. Only for a moment, he seemed to see something. When he licked his head, Doolin’s cigarettes were already lit, and the fire was also It goes out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a moment and recovered, smiled and shook his head, and did not care about Doolin’s statement. Although he is an Ogden, he is an apostle of money. Under the call of the devil, he has even thrown into the abyss, such as morality and justice. There will be great patriotic sentiments, and this thing can exchange money. If you can change one hundred pounds first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only thing that is fortunate is that you have asked for a job, so that it will not make the public have too much dislike of you.", about this, Kevin is also I am very impressed. Du Lin’s growth rate far exceeds the limit he can guess. He has used his tens of thousands of jobs to clean up his suspicion of “selling the country”, and he can be sure that if someone jumps out to attack him The excuse, he must be able to find a balance point in public opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of person should be a politician on the horse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shameless people always cherish the shameless people, because everyone can see each other’s essence at a glance, which can also be called things to gather together, people to group . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not continue to entangle on this topic, but instead asked the situation of the Buddha, "Oredo's case is over? Kevin shook his head and yawned. After the first trial, he received an invitation from Du Lin. He arrived here by steam locomotive. Then, in the face of a commercial contract of almost ten centimeters, each clause was checked line by line, and some problems were found out. After the consultations between the two parties, the amendments were made. He is really tired, and has not experienced this feeling for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I yawned and squeezed two tears like a crocodile's tears, he raised his hand and rubbed the traces of wet eyes. "It is estimated that there are still several trials to be won. If you win, you will definitely win. You are not. I know that Vivienne’s two brothers actually recruited a lawyer group, but when I appeared in the court, their chief defense lawyers forgot to argue.” Speaking of the triumphant Kevin could not help but haha laugh it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that he is a happy person in his life, has a job that everyone envy, and has set a great name in this industry, rich With identity and status, he feels that he has already achieved the ultimate in this line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he didn’t feel any boredom, he only felt that it was not enough, it was not enough, he needed more cases to support himself. His prestige and fame make him have more time and capital to experience all the best things in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The key point of the question now is whether the artwork hanging on the wall has been loaded into the collection room. If it is collected, there may be some trouble... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't ask me about this thing, you said it directly to the Buddha." Kevin had a mouth and Du Lin knew what he was doing, many When the court is just going through a court session, the real competition is out of court. If you can "find" the proof to support Kevin's position, then the jury will think that the artwork and the house are one. If they can't find enough proof, they will fall to Vivian's two brothers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This requires a little trick, for example, key witnesses may suddenly remember what they said wrong, or remember something that was forgotten. Or there are some key new witnesses and new testimonies, or even some evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin’s smile twice. “Well, well, I will fix it myself, I know you will definitely not help me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought for a moment, "It’s okay to help you, but do you know how I charge now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin ridiculed again, "This sentence should be Dudu or Vivian to tell you, not you. Tell me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Kevin helped Wei Wei'an win the case. According to the friendship price, Wei Wei'an must pay at least the winning fee of not less than 600,000, and other related expenses, about 800,000 to 900,000. between. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the most profitable in the world except doctors are lawyers, the former only need to use a pen to sell a lot of low-cost high-priced drugs, while the latter and the former The difference is not big, you can eat and eat when you move your mouth, the key is that they don't break the law! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this period, one thing happened, making Doolin a little unpleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomson finally found a company that is willing to establish a private hospital in Otis with a few dozens of calls, but the other party has a request, that is the city of Otis It is necessary to provide no less than 10,000 square meters of land for free, and also requires the City Hall to construct the main building of the hospital according to their requirements and design, and bear all the expenses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s simple to say that the city of Otis has chosen the address for the hospital to build the house and then give it to them, they will consider the city of Otis to run the hospital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the problem caused by the lack of medical market in small cities. Private medical companies often do not see the medical market in small cities. They prefer to get together in the metropolis to save their own money. Building hospitals because they know that all the inputs can be earned, but small cities are difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomson brought the request of the other party to Doolin, Du Lin refused without considering it, and now the other person has the qualification of arrogance, but he believes that it will not last long. These people will ask for the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards, Du Lin took out one million of the tax from the name of the city hall and chose a piece of land near the new town hall in the city center that had just been demolished. It is planned to build a medium-sized hospital. As for the doctors and nurses that need to be filled in the hospital – this is Thomson’s new job. He needs to figure out how much the doctors in the surrounding cities, including the Imperial Capital, are, how much the commission is. In short, everything must be clarified. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then according to the way doctors are now earning, slightly add some to dig them up, simply to say that they are using money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe Thomson may not have experience in this area, and has not done similar work before, and the progress is somewhat slow. But it doesn't matter, Mr. Edward is with him now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no local education resource in the city of Otis. After the children of this city have completed nine years of primary school, they have to go to other places to find high school. There is a high school in the local area, but then the young people go out to work. Lost the source of life, and finally had to close down. Even the only public elementary school in Otis, there are only more than 20 teachers and less than a thousand children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only maintained if the State Medical Education Resources Office subsidizes it, otherwise it will be finished soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of a complete education system is not something that can be done by a single person. Just like to dig people everywhere, just let them form a digging group. The city of Otis goes to recruit talents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a city that is in vain, and Du Lin has played this game fairly well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only regret is that Doolin’s good mood was only maintained until the next day. Governor Harry gave Du Lin a call and told him that someone was facing him. Spilled water on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a news about the project that you taught the federal people to the state of Oscar today. In addition to reporting this incident, the reporter added comments. He believes that this is a traitorous act."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osque is located in the northernmost part of the empire, connected to the grasslands and the frozen mountains, and is remote and can no longer be remote. But this remote place is not only the lowest in all states of the empire, but also among the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ogdin people originally made their fortune from here. They hired the nomads and the frozen mountains to hate having to wear clothes to embody their own bravery. They will be frozen every winter. The barbarians who died many people fought for them. Oske is their hometown, and in the source language, Oske means a light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only four cities in Oswego, and the only city without a capital, has been operating stably under the old party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report is a newspaper in which sales in a city is not very large. The newspaper lists some "bad things" that Doolin has done, such as him. Instructed his own police chief to shoot innocent citizens in the bank, or he escorted the smugglers. In addition, this time he handed the project to the federal people, which has caused some local people to hate Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
