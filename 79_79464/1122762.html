			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a house to have it, how can it not be empty? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin is not always paying, he will have a lot of gains, and some of the gains will never be seen by his own efforts, such as Magus Some resources in hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some dizzy middle class who have been blown by the empire dreams. They always think that as long as they work hard and continue to be promoted, they will one day be able to stand on the tower. Top people, but this is actually impossible. Whether the ladder leading to the top of the tower is put down in the hands of the little man, this has nothing to do with hard work and no effort, and this is not a gap that can be crossed by effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new party organization in the west will provide the necessary help for Doolin’s election, such as the momentum, for example, the current governor can nominate Du Lin, but this is A big killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current institutional rules, the nomination of the predecessor is a very important indicator, and can even be said to be a continuation of political life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an official has reached the stage of promotion or retirement in a post, his successor may not be in the political program and the concept of governance. The predecessor maintains a high degree of consistency, which is a terrible thing for the interests of the management community. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is highly engaged with the capitalist’s harvest of social wealth, and the latter strongly opposes the excessive interference of capitalists in the distribution of social wealth. The polarized political program is likely to make the current The vested interests of the devotees spit out more of the benefits swallowed in the past and redistributed social resources. This is not what those people want to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in order to avoid some unknown risks, the local interest groups or investors will gather the size of their own business in the last one or two years of the official’s term of office. And then began to wait and see, which will cause a serious lag or even a recession in the speed of the local economy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid such a situation, the best way is to pre-appoint a candidate that he thinks fit, and the political program and the concept of governance are not bad. Being a continuation of political life is the heir. Then the social interest groups know how to make choices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the votes in a region are concentrated in various entrepreneurs. They have the tendency to choose the majority of voters, because these votes ultimately involve the interests of the company itself, and the interests of the company are also the interests of employees. The cabinet has repeatedly demanded that it should not interfere with the freedom of voters to vote, but the effect is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also causes the political power of the New Party and the Old Party to not change much, unless someone chooses to betray, otherwise they want to have a wide range of politics. A change in position is impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the governor nominates Doolin, it will have a very positive effect on Du Lin’s next election, and no matter what the plan will be after Du Lin’s coming to power At least those entrepreneurs know who to vote for in the next round of voting. As for some of the problems that are not on the table, it is the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s just a nomination, it’s not unusual, and it’s something that you can’t do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Howthon treats his little secretary, Ben is good enough to nominate Ernst as the next mayor of Irian, if he really In doing so, Ernst’s campaign success rate will increase indefinitely. He is very familiar with the entire social structure and economic structure of Irian, and has good friendships with various companies and capitalists. However, Hossington did not intend to do so, which immediately led to the departure of Ernst. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that a person can't just rely on, but if Ernst has a strong backing, it's just a matter of words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Du Lin left, Magus and Doolin talked about a problem, a social problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of immigrants poured into the empire, especially after the financial tsunami and the empire’s invasion in the Federation, more people chose immigration empire, in this environment The composition of immigrants in the society has gradually increased, and some small frictions have appeared in various places. At present, the western region is the most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past few days, I have paid attention to some of the problems on your side, how do you plan to resolve the conflict between locals and immigrants?", Magus Station It took a few steps to get up and it was not so long for him to be sedentary. The ruthlessness of the years was reflected in the old gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once he was able to go to sleep to deal with government affairs, now a little longer will be uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has always maintained a variety of sitting postures. He is the best moment in life. People often use this sentence to describe the period from the age of 30 to the age of 40. In this period, experience is obtained. Great progress has been made, and it is also a time when human energy and physical strength are relatively full. But Du Lin is not the same, he does not lack experience experience, from his adulthood, every minute is his best time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ordered a cigarette, took a sip, and spit it out slowly. "After the conflict has intensified, he will deal with it. If there is no contradiction between the locals and the immigrants, Let it break out completely, and it will be extinguished when it first appears. These problems can never be solved. Monkeys will feel sad because of the death of the same kind and will be far away from the place where humans gather. Driving them will only make them hate. This is me. "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus thought and said, "You better be able to make sure things don't go beyond your control and turn this into a negative Social phenomenon." Although it was warning Du Lin, Magus also approved Du Lin's approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dulin said, the contradiction is not completely broken out, and it is not the best solution to rely on tinkering to put out the signs. Of course this doesn't apply to everything, just for some events. If the hatred between the locals and the immigrants does not have a huge outbreak and has certain serious consequences, the hatred will continue to accumulate in the two groups, and eventually a big explosion that is completely uncontrollable or even cleaned up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, the loss suffered by the whole society may be even more serious. It is better to detonate these problems within a controllable range and then calmly clean them up. Pull out something to warn the whole society as an experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Du Lin’s mature thinking, Magus smiled and hammered his waist with a backhand. “Okay, it’s not too early, you can go back.” Rested..." His words were not finished and hesitated for a moment. "After two days, you will come and see something to discuss with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deciding to draw Doolin and let him develop in the direction he set for him, then it is necessary to smooth Doolin's donkey, which is very clear. You can't let others work with you with hate or boredom. You have to make him feel awkward, so that employees can exert more work motivation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, Marques decided to file a new draft with the Imperial Parliament on the equal status of the various ethnic groups in the empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
