			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not make a decision immediately. The establishment of the party was definitely not a child’s play. The Mennon’s Kadima party was very loud. When no one punctures this balloon, almost all Everyone feels that the Kadima Party can sweep across the entire West and use three governors to lay the political power of the Kadima Party. However, when the Mennon died, this seemingly beautiful party became a thing of the past. The forces of the old and the old parties soon became integrated into the lives of local people, and even a splash did not rise. But on the other hand, no matter what the new party leader Magus or the old party leader Kubar, no matter who they both had an accident, such as a heart attack, suddenly I left the world. Will the old and new parties have a sudden dissolution like the Kadima Party? Obviously it is impossible. No matter who does the new and old leaders of the two parties, whoever has an accident, it is impossible to shake the foundation of the two parties. So why do the old and new parties have a strong ability to resist risks, but the Kadima Party does not? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is very simple. The old and new parties are not completely regarded as two political groups, as some people often say, the past nobles They put on a new title and continue to be aristocrats in this era. They are called new aristocrats without a noble title. In this country, the feudal dynasty rule of the past centuries has long allowed everyone who lives here to accept the idea that the aristocracy rules the world, whether the new party or the old party, their subject will not change, it is still The nobility is leading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So people naturally accept it, no matter how complicated the country’s political structure and system changes, as long as the ruler is still aristocrat, then it is OK! They have turned this situation of aristocratic rule into a convention, and the new era has only been in existence for more than 20 years. People have not completely come out of the old society, especially in thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kadima Party does not have the characteristics of "noble", even if they do it well, it is only a group of ordinary people like the general public. Being ruled by the nobility, it should be a tradition, but it is ruled by ordinary people...not necessarily unacceptable, but it does not necessarily have a strong cohesive force. Some of the most important middle class in society are still thinking about making class restoration, and how can they accept the rule of ordinary people and recognize this situation? Obviously impossible, so when the peasant died, the Westerners did not care about the changes in the local political subjects, and they did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that this situation will continue, there must be some abnormal noise in the long river of history to make this boring river interesting. Some people will quietly change something when they give their lives without hesitation for some potentially stupid beliefs. People's thoughts, their cognition of the world, and their understanding of themselves will change in these waves. In the end, there will be someone standing up and shouting that they will no longer be oppressed, no longer enslaved, and the slogan of fighting for freedom will set off an earth-shattering revolution and make a new face for the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only then will the general public's thoughts be improved, and in the shock of countless blood and tears, they will wake up from numbness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before that, maybe this world is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin never intended to be a revolutionary pioneer of the times. The first person who took a step more than others would often crash on the south wall. He has more great ambitions, how can he be a role that is destined to be a tragedy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can make your name engraved on the bottom of the river of history, and countless later people admire worship is the highest goal of some people’s lives, then Du Lin’s goal is to become a small boat and follow the trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While letting Mr. Hellsmann recruit people to form a campaign team, Du Lin took the time to visit Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing outside the door of Villa One of Empire Avenue, the guard looked at him curiously from time to time. The guard was new. He knew Du Lin but didn’t know. What does Doolin have to do with Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About about five minutes or so, Magus’s wife opened the door for him. She is very old, but it doesn’t look like I feel that because of the age, her appearance has become ugly, but there is a more noble temperament that makes people convinced. "I heard that you are coming, I made some crepes, and when you leave, you bring them." This is her. At present, she is the biggest hobby. She has been retiring for many years. She will go out to socialize in the early years. Now she is too lazy to go. The world belongs to young people. When she goes to those young people, she will feel meaningless. stay at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pressing Magus to play with her on weekdays, the rest of the hobby is to make some small snacks, but the lady’s snacks have a special The place, that is too sweet! She always hopes that life can feel sweet happiness like honey, adding sugar and adding honey, maybe it can do this, even for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sent a handful of gifts, a bottle of red wine purchased in a small country producing wine before he came back, for 12 years, each bottle The price is around two hundred. Such a wine with a beautiful packaging can at least give people a feeling that it is worth at least five hundred pieces because the box has dozens of pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't want to bring these things at all. Just think of it as your home. The old man is waiting for you in the study. I will make some small snacks and bring them with you when you leave."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin watched the temperamental lady disappear into the corner. He walked outside the study room and knocked on the door. A familiar voice came in the door. "Come in."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed the door open, the sun illuminates the room through the window, there are some floating particles in the air, nowhere in the sun. The smell of ink and ink in the nose can calm down for a moment, which is a magical place. Magus sat at the table. In the sun, he wore a pair of narrow reading glasses and lowered his head slightly. His eyes looked at him through the gap between the frame and his forehead. "Sit casually, want to drink." What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat on a single sofa, the weather had warmed up, and a lazy taste quieted as he blended into the sun. Health, "tea? or water, can be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler outside the door immediately prepared for Du Lin. After he left, Magus closed. The book in your hand is firmly on the table. "What do you want to say to me? In most cases, when I invite you, you will be willing to come."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is of course also true. When there is no time, Du Lin is not willing to come to see Magus. This old man is very wise, but it gives people a very affectionate feeling. He can’t find it from him. A shelf for any big nobility. It is easy to ignore his identity in the chat, but this is the most deadly, because he is Magus, a very powerful politician, and the number one in the new party. When chatting with him, he will always unknowingly disclose some things. This is why Du Lin is not willing to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sighed with a sigh. "In fact, I just want to tell you, I plan to run for the governor of a certain western state."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?", Magus corrected the sitting position, took off his eyes, gently clasped his hands and fingers together on the thighs, he looked like a smile Du Lin, after looking for a while, asked, "Is it a non-party person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head, "No, it’s a new party." The identity of the party members."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggs slightly decapitated, this is the most correct choice, non-partisan or set up a small party under the current political situation There won't be any big development. How much he can guess some of Doolin's ambitions, but also affirmed his current choices. Of course, these are not enough. He thinks that Doolin should understand where the problem is now, so he is waiting for Du Lin to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was about twenty-three, four, five, six, seven, eight seconds, and Du Lin’s mouth was bent. “I’ve been out of the country for so long in a blink of an eye. I haven’t been back for a while, and my peers are married. I am still just a person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that you want to introduce the royal princess to know me. I don't know if this is a count?!" < br 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马Full of anger, although old, but still not old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his eyes, there is a hint of appreciation for Doolin, this look has rarely appeared in these years, Du Lin is really too good, if he How good is your son? Once Maggs thought about it, many things would be simpler and not as complicated as they are now. Unfortunately, Du Lin was unwilling to accept such "exploitation" and was unwilling to become an aristocrat, which made Magus very disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either Du Lin, or Magus, it is clear that Du Lin has come to this step, or he has begun to change, and it is the political pattern of the empire. , is the rules of the game, like the loophole he will find the rules of the game when he first made a home, and then break the rules. Either head to the bloodshed, or the glory of the head, the road has already died, and there is no way out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either, accept the rules of the nobility, he marries a nobleman, and then he gives to the nobles what he has been fighting for for a lifetime - he and him The wife's child will inherit everything from Doolin, which is a rule that must be observed. This child will return to the aristocratic group after Du Lin’s death. In other words, Du Lin’s struggle for a lifetime will eventually become the aristocratic industry that marries him. Of course not all, and some will be broken up. It was absorbed into the nourishment by the entire aristocratic class. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the history, many great people have acquired the identity of the nobility by virtue of marriage with the nobility, and thus began to dance and become the most eye-catching one on the political stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many people know that the "wealth" of these people's life has finally returned to the hands of the aristocratic class and will not flow into the civilian class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is the rule, as long as you want to participate in this game, more advanced games, then you must follow the rules of the game! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
