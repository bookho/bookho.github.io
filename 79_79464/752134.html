			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, the red sun rises from sea level, and the red is like a huge fireball. The sunlight at this time is not glaring, and the light is also warm with a hint of red. The guests who had been crazy for the night in the first district came out of the entertainment venues exhausted, and casually went to the place where they lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than half an hour of silence, finally ushered in a real morning. The golden sun cleans the darkness of the street like a sword, shining on people, looking at the rising sun, just like looking at an unbeaten god of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin still sat in the chair, sipped the same coffee, ate a half-baked burritos and looked at the newspaper in his hand. The newsboy stood in front of Doolin, and the hat was held in his hand. Some of them were uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, Du Lin took out a twenty-dollar bill from his pocket and stuffed it into the newsboy’s hat. "I want to know Hu." Ann and his family have all the news that I deserve to see. This is half of the deposit. The sooner the better!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newsboy’s eyes are bright, he thought these two Ten pieces are all, I didn’t expect it to be only half. He immediately put the hat with the money directly on his head, and specially licked his hair, so that the lining of the hat and the hair were closely attached together. "Sir, you can see everything you want tomorrow morning!" He said that he stooped and bowed, as he ran to the streets every morning, and began to distribute newspapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These newsboys have their own intelligence network, and there is a more advanced intelligence network on top of them that manages them, there is anything you want about Irian. Knowing things, only need to spend the equivalent price, you can know from the mouth the vast majority of the news that is not very popular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan is quite famous in the city of Ilyan. He is a celebrity in the society. He has three brewing workshops and a bar. These are his legal business. There are legal licenses to support his production and sale of various alcoholic beverages. As a tourist city, alcoholic beverages are indispensable consumables. Even some people from the outside to Ilian are aiming to drink a high degree of wine without any scruples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If tourism is the first economic pillar of Irian, then the brewery and those bars are the second largest economic pillar of Ilyan. Unlike other business categories, winemaking and the sale of drinks are subject to high taxes, which is 45 percent. When sales exceed a certain amount, they will increase, up to 60%. Taxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so, Juan has earned a lot of money, so that a guy who used to burn a boiler has become the number one in the city of Irian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stared at him for two reasons. The first was that he had four license plates and three bars in his hand. With the license, Du Lin can unscrupulously produce legal private wine and then smuggle it into illegal areas to sell. Even if the problem is detected, it can't catch up with Du Lin's body, because it is legal to brew a high-alcohol wine here. The second reason is that Juan invested in a shopping mall near the central area in the 8th district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mall has a total of five floors in the planning, close to 45,000 square meters of business area, with a total investment of about 12 million. If Juan and his boiler family are a strong family, then Du Lin will definitely stay away from it, but he is only a wine-selling wine. There is no powerful help in politics. It is the softest persimmon, so Du Lin intends to take it. a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Du Lin will be very sympathetic with him to discuss whether he can jointly invest, if he can, he does not mind that he invested half of the partnership to complete the project. But if he doesn't know what to do, then Du Lin will not be polite with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the cup and drink away the little coffee left, stained the water stains on the lips, and Du Lin put five dollars on it. Under the plate, a regular walk was started with a newspaper. Just as he passed the Irian City Police Department, the police station just woke up. The policemen who came to work were slightly sleepy and squeezed into the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irian’s special social environment is doomed that the police are not a lazy job, especially in the latter half of the night, the major entertainment venues are still in normal business, this When the tourists or the local drunks are drinking too much, they often get rubbed because of some minor problems, and eventually they happen to be fighting. So when the first district is resting, the police will take a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good to do shifts at the police station, otherwise you can really kill people. The police on duty during the day worked from 7:30 in the morning to 7:30 in the evening, and the night policeman worked from 8:00 in the evening until 5 am, leaving everyone resting for two hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police officer in charge of the detention was yawning and signed his name on the check-in book, and then took out the hot nappa burritos from the backpack. With a thick cup of milk, I took a bite with joy. The tababs here have changed with the authentic burritos. Most of the burritos in other places are filled with beef, but here is the fish of deep-sea fish. Who makes the fish cheaper? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, in order to stabilize more customers, the cooks cut the fish into thin slices and fry them on the frying pan until they are crispy and golden on both sides, which makes them taste more fragrant and more tasteful. As for whether it will be too greasy and it is unhealthy to eat, that is another matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police officer is obviously hungry. He quickly eats the things in his hands and feels that he can eat another one, but he thinks His weight has exceeded the standard, and he still decided to take control of his mouth. The police officers in Irian City are really not good. Not only do they work hard, but the police even ask the police officers to have a healthy image. They refuse to join the police or fat people. This is to maintain the positive image of the police officers. In order to maintain the image of Irian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the iron gate in the detention area, took a look at the desk on the desk, then took the key to the first detention room, opened the iron Door, "You can go home!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men who were drunk and drunk were coming out and staring at the police In the eyes of the staff, the police officer smiled and said: "If you don't want to go, you can go in again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who walks behind pushes the guy in front of him, The two men swayed away from the detention area. The police officer also locked the door and returned to his booth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately nine o'clock in the morning, someone was going to pick up Elis for interrogation, but when the two went outside the first detention room, Suddenly stunned by the picture inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilys actually hanged? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policeman took the wrong key several times before he opened the iron gate. When they rushed in, Ilys’ body was already cold, and he was responsible for the trial. The prosecutor glanced at the police officer with a stunned look. "I want to know what happened, why are such important witnesses going to die here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short time After the panic, the policeman also came back. His eyes were very rude and swept back and forth twice on the prosecutor. "Who doesn't want to live, who can stop? He said that he did not inform me before he hanged, you Do you know how many things have happened in the Irian area after the summer? I haven’t had a break since I am busy, and I have no time to come here. I originally asked you to give him a single room. If he doesn’t live in this single room, it won’t happen. Things, I think if there is a problem, the problem lies with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
