			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin took a shower and changed into a casual dress and walked into the living room, the two people sitting on the sofa whispering immediately stood up. They turned and smiled at Du Lin, and Du Lin was looking at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man, in his fifties, his hair is already white, and there is a little bit of a top, and there are not many hair on his head. On the contrary, his beard is not too small, although he has already been grayed out, but it makes him look a bit... like a pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin doesn’t know why he thinks about this profession, or that the word is drawn directly from his mind. This man’s first impression is like It is a pastor, a...an official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person is a girl, it seems that she is not twenty years old, she has a face that conforms to the modern aesthetics, while the facial features are three-dimensional Exquisite, a brown hair makes this girl a little mysterious. She doesn't have makeup, and if it's makeup, it's the kind of light makeup that Du Lin can't see. Young girls don't need any makeup at all to make them look good. Because this thing of youth is invincible when facing any aspect of the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks like one meter seven or one meter more than seven meters, and her body is also very good, not the kind of very exaggerated type. Simply put, such a girl I should bathe in the sun under a tree on campus, and read a slightly favorite book in a quiet and focused manner. It is the goddess that all high school boys dream of. She can be anywhere, but it should not be here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This review seems to be very long, actually only lasted for three or five seconds, Du Lin went to the opposite side of the sofa, one hand squatting at the waist, making An invitation to the action, "Please sit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two nodded and then re-settled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very sorry, the two are very superficial, have we seen it before?", Du Lin as the owner, it should be open, this is a courtesy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man has always maintained a kind of smile. "Mr. Doolin, we should apologize that we are right, we will visit you without prior notice. We are too presumptuous.", he said that he paused, and then gave up some positions to highlight the girl around him. "This is Angela, a freshman at Louis University, majoring in modern medicine and also my granddaughter. After Du Lin and the girls asked each other, the man began to introduce himself. "I am Charles. You can call me that. Of course, you can call me Charlie like a friend."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling nodded and said that he was clear. There was still a trace of doubt in his eyes. Charles's eyes were very gentle, as if he could unconsciously smooth the irritations in people's hearts. "Mr. Doolin, I don't know. Have you heard of the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charis’s words, Du Lin knew that these two people came from, no doubt Charlie Tusi in the mouth of the mouth. In the western soil, the gods are a very mysterious religious organization. They advocate eating horses to cure diseases, and they are still the horses that have just been pulled out by horses. It is said that eating that thing can cure a lot of illnesses. Many local old people believe in Buddhism, and the policy of Buddhism to promote monogamy, adding the freedom of religion to the Imperial Basic Law, which is very attractive to many men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But under the Tushen, it is said that there are many conspiracy hidden. As for the conspiracy of these plots, no one is clear. They invaded most of the forces and had terrible influence in the West, but they did nothing, and didn't even want someone to mention them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s thoughts should be heard. “I didn’t go to the West for a long time. It’s not clear to Tusi, but I’ve heard it.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles doesn’t care at all whether Doolin’s statement is offensive to his beliefs, but rather accredited to say, “It’s true, in a lot of outside worlds.” The factors that interfere with each other will always make something change the original appearance. Tushenism is one of them. This visit to you is to hope that you can understand our beliefs more intuitively and understand us..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next account of Charles, the original Tusiism was not really called the name of the cult of the gods, the real name of their religious organization is " The seat of the Mother Earth God, the belief is a land goddess called Ozola. The reason why it is not the goddess of the earth is the goddess, because in their religious chronicles, the earth goddess Ozola gave birth to a series of gods in the three-stream knight fantasy novels such as the sun god, luna, and god of war. It is the mother of the gods and the noble god and supreme god of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the West, and even outside the West, there are many believers who have become the cornerstones of the whole earth goddess... Lin feels that it is still a catchy story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Charles came to visit Du Lin with his granddaughter, hoping to let Du Lin know that it is more important to understand some of the information about Tushenism. He invited Du Lin to join the Tuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Invitation...I?", Du Lin was so strange, he couldn't help but smile. "Mr. Charles, since you can come here to make this invitation seriously, then you should also know that I am actually operating. An organization called a fellowship, and as a guar, I have always believed in the king and the gods, and the firm piety cannot be shaken by the will of the people. Thank you and your church for favoring me. But I have to say a word of regret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles waved his hand, "Mr. Doolin, you may not know enough about us, no matter what you believe in, It’s a manifestation of your own will, and we won’t force you to change your faith. The seat of the Mother Earth is a religious organization, but it’s an inclusive religious organization. We don’t think that all beliefs are different like some churches. People are all infidels, you can still believe in everything you believe in here.", Charles's smile has always been exactly the same as at the beginning, even if Du Lin refused his invitation, it did not happen.  Variety. At this time, he glanced at Angela, the granddaughter around him, and then looked at Doolin again. "And I believe that as long as you understand us a little more deeply." You will feel the difference between us and others. You won't lose anything here, but the opposite is that you can get a lot more than you can imagine!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles’ words made Duolin feel strange again, don’t change your faith, don’t pay anything, or even have a binding canon, then the existence of this Tuss is For what? For the light and love? For justice and justice? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can I get?", Du Lin raised his leg, took out a cigarette and looked at the two with a questioning look, Charles Point Nodded, he only ordered for himself. "To be honest, I am very curious. If I joined this... you, what can I get, what do I need to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Charles's hand gently pressed on the shoulder of his granddaughter Angela, the little girl lowered her head, and he quickly flew the topic out of the subject. "Do you think my granddaughter is beautiful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a fool will say "No, she is ugly" or "I feel very general, no big deal" at this time, in order to make the topic happy In the absence of serious violations of his own intentions, Du Lin praised the girl's appearance. She is really beautiful. Du Lin never doubts that he can tell what is beautiful and what is ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles was very satisfied with Doolin's praise, which made him very happy. "Then I will send you a gift first. Angela is your private thing from today, you can do anything to her, it all depends on you. The preference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is perhaps the slowest response Dulin has in the chat, because Charles always makes something that he has to say to the other person. The content is reversed and I understand it several times to make sure I have not understood it correctly. If he didn't understand it wrong, Charles gave his granddaughter to himself and gave it to himself as an item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always heard that the people of the West are very simple. I didn’t expect them to be so simple. I sat down and spoke for a half-hour and sent a delicious dessert. The more so, Du Lin thinks that Charles has a big problem including the Tuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This faintly reminds Doolin of a place, a magical place - a farm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of Doolin's dream, there is an animal called pig. In fact, there is also here, but it is called the thorn, and the bristles and thorns on the body are very strong. It is a herbivore that even the lions are not willing to prey. Because the meat and dry wood also exudes a stinking smell, no one will eat that kind of thing, even if it is between eating wolf meat and eating thorny meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Doolin’s dream, there is a place called a farm. Those animals called pigs don’t need to do anything in the farm. Those breeders will give Pigs are enough to eat and drink, and they will be physically quarantined and even involved in sports. They don't have to pay any price during the whole feeding process, and they enjoy such a high quality life from the moment they are born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the breeder shouted "street", the nightmare will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very similar to the Tushenism. You don’t need to pay anything to enjoy all the good things. Is this really possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this can't exist, there is definitely a clear purpose behind all actions, but they cover up their purpose in this way, To cover the eyes of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what is their purpose? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
