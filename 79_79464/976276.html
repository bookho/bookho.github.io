			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin is chatting with Mr. Federley to talk about gold mines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold mine in the west is always the most attractive thing for people. A newly discovered gold mine first represents not wealth, not luck, but disaster. . Every time a new gold mine is discovered, it means a bloody and cruel killing begins. It’s hard to stop when the predators don’t enter the game. It’s not a big crocodile that every time they join the game on time, they also need to consider whether the things they have in their hands are too More, will it cause people to rebound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the western part of the empire. It is synonymous with barbarism. Even if the capital crocodile has caused public anger here, some people dare to touch the past to make a vote. Who wants to round out the business here, then the simple western people will tell them that the money is put into a pocket, and finally the pocket will be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even if new gold mines appear, those predators will not show excessive appetite too much. This is not the South, not the East, not the North. It is not the place where many civilized people live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Federley has a gold mine and a gem mine here, he is the supplier of the Doolin Irian jewelry store, the jewelry of the Irian side The store has been using Mr. Federley's gold and gems, and both sides have a good relationship. With the gold of Federley's formal channel, Du Lin cleaned his gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time in the West, the first person Du Lin met was Federley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jack has a certain understanding of the West, but he does not live in the West. His understanding of the West comes from those under his command. It looks like he It seems that I know a lot of things, but these things don't necessarily work in the West. So Du Lin first came to meet with Federley and talked about some specific things in the West. This topic started from the mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a bit of interesting news recently, it must be something over the Yagur Mountains..." Mr. Federley is in his fifties. The appearance is very ordinary, the only thing that makes people feel regret is his hair. The middle piece has already been lost. There is only a big bald head that can reflect the light and shadow. "The last time the West Mine will... Oh, you just It is not very clear about the things here. The West Mine will be an abbreviation, the full name is the Western Mining Development Committee, composed of large and small mine owners, mainly to solve some wrangling things."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It is said that several tourists have found an iron ore in the river that has been dry and weathered for many years outside the Yagur Mountains, and then brought it back. They were discovered when they were taken out at the market. After inspection, they found that The already oxidized silver mine, the news of the silver mine in Yagur, immediately spread, and almost the vast majority of free gold diggers and large and small forces ran away. They have never paid attention to Yagur in the past. A huge silver mine was discovered near the mountainous area. According to the exploration results of the West Mine, the Yagurshan silver mine is rich in ore, and the finished product stock is between 120,000 and 200,000 tons."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A few copper mines have been discovered around them. Geologists believe that some of the underlying faults have been caused by topographical changes. Yagur Mountain should have huge and rich mineral resources, copper. The presence of mines and silver mines means that there may be some other mineral deposits and associated deposits, so everyone rushed over.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin listened with relish, Although he is not at all But it does not hinder his curiosity. "No one wants to take it there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get it?", Federley laughed, "You are joking, Du Lin, 120,000 tons of silver mines, even if the Imperial official forcibly occupied the mine, I am afraid it will not last much time, which means a huge fortune, anyone who wants to win only Will be bloodwashed by others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current western world silver price is very stable, according to the exchange rate of the empire to calculate an imperial star can buy four grams of finished sterling silver, If a silver mine with a capacity of 120,000 tons is excavated and purified into finished products, the total price is about 30 billion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a number that makes everyone crazy, so any individual or group that wants to dominate this mine alone will be blinded by some wealth. Already the mad mob attacked the smog, 30 billion, and the taxes they received from the New Party’s stage have not been so much! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is a nice chalcopyrite next to it, and there are other small mining areas nearby, and it is very likely that other types of huge bonanzas are still hidden. Under the auspices of the Western Mining Association, Yagur Mountain has become a “public mining area”. Anyone, any group can go mining in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term of the public mining area was originally from some depleted deposits. After many low-reserve mines were completely exhausted, the mine owner would give up and even give up the mine. The ownership of the region is not very cost-effective if you buy land in the west without a mine. According to the current empire's current land use regulations, non-agricultural and residential land needs to be commercialized after purchase, and a certain number of jobs need to be resolved according to some local standards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no mineral deposit in their land and they don't give up, these mine owners must spend money to support a group of people. Whether he has something to do or not, he will put the designated "salary" into the designated account every month. Otherwise, you will face problems such as fines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So once most mines can be dug without mines, the mine owners will immediately give up ownership of the land, from private land to public land, this time The mine on the block has become a public mine. The mineral deposit is sometimes magical. It is not that there is nothing left. It may be dug here, and there is something to be dug up. In the past, some mine owners abandoned the depleted mines and found that new veins were dug up, and not many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once vested in the public, it is not an easy task to buy it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge silver mine discovered in this Yagol Mountain has become a public mining area because of its huge reserves, no one dares to occupy it, and it can not afford it. It is said that there are more than 400,000 people living in the mountains of Yagur. In just three months, from zero to 400,000 is definitely a terrorist growth rate. And because the news is not spread enough, the weather is too cold, many people have not passed, after the spring, I am afraid that the number of people there will exceed one million, or even more! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a chat about the Yagur Mountains, Mr. Federley turned his head and asked about the reasons for Du Lin’s development in the west. . He and Du Lin have known each other for three or four years, and everyone is still happy to cooperate. Du Lin can be said to have enough understanding. In his view, Du Lin's development in the west is purely a thankless thing. The doors that Du Lin currently operates are far more profitable than mining, and the prospect potential is much greater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gold mine of Mr. Federley can produce about 400 to 500 pounds of pure gold per year, with a market value of about 1.2 million. He removed all the costs, including the purchase of slaves and the formation of the mine protection team and the daily losses of wages, the account is more than 800,000, of course, he also has a gem mine. The money seems to have been very much, and the profits from the good industries of some merchants are much higher, but compared to those tycoons, this money is nothing compared to Du Lin’s smuggling business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s current private wine trade can bring him more than 400,000 net profits every month, his income month in Otis More than one million, which does not include other income, so it is a stupid investment for Mr. Federley to see Du Lin running to the west to mine. The biggest dream of these individual or collective mine owners in the West is to make a fortune, and then leave the western part of the poor place where dust is everywhere, and enjoy the South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
