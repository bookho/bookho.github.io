			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where Felicia rested was arranged by Du Lin at the hotel in Alexandria, and this hotel in Otis was the most luxurious. The hotel built by others, Doolin, is not easy to intervene, but Alexander's industry can be arrogant, and it is also inevitable that he wants to get some high-end suites to receive some important guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander’s red face personally made a simple meal for Fei Lijia. After he got it, he excitedly collected the kitchen utensils for cooking, saying that he wanted to Make the artwork hanging and let people know that this set of kitchen utensils has been made for a princess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felica simply ate something, and then politely praised the cook's craft, they went to the top floor suite. There was only one room in the entire top floor, which was Doolin’s suggestion and helped Alexander to name the suite – the Royal Suite. All the interior decoration is decorated in the style of the royal palace. In addition to having a small swimming pool, there is also a stadium and a lawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this suite, the following three floors are also forbidden to stay, avoiding the inexplicable harassment of the free Princess Ritz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the room, the other person was sent away. Fei Lijia sat on the sofa and looked at Vitor, whispered: "You are very good today. Rude, you should not make such a move, this will make people doubt you, including my upbringing!", Fei Lijia is accusing Vitor of talking before Du Lin pleading, the chaos is the biggest s failure. She never thought that a person as reliable as Vitor could actually do such a thing, she was already a little angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn’t matter when you are in the family, but now they are in the city of Otis, they represent not only themselves, but also the decent of the Fatima family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Excuse me, Miss, I am impulsive, I will remember this lesson, I won’t make it again in the future!", Vitor did not explain anything directly, In the relationship between Fei Lijia and him, there is no point in justifying itself. His honor and dissatisfaction all depend on Felica's words, so admit his mistake is his only choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frijia did not say anything, just nodded, "I have to rest, you go to rest, you have to deal with the owner here at night." We."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the car outside the hotel, Harry licked his temple. "You shouldn't be so rude. Miss Felicia is still not married. You can't reach out to her. This is a matter of etiquette, unless she reaches out first. You have to know. In the socialization of the nobility... Forget it, you can remember this thing.", Harry finally did not say it, he knew that even if he said that Du Lin may not be in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is increasingly convinced that Doolin is a thorn, and he still can’t keep up. He doesn’t have much respect for the top, unlike other cities. Long, seeing yourself honestly is like a child facing a strict teacher in the classroom. If you say something to yourself, you can't use it to record it. After you go back, you will recite it every day and engrave it in your bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he has too many ideas of his own, perhaps it’s time to find him and "exile" him for a while, letting him realize that if there is no one in politics Support him, be his backer, and his identity-born person will be unable to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it will not work for a short time, and there are still some things that Dulin is responsible for. After he has explained the things in his hand, he can send him to a remote place to comfortably live a life without a fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How was the banquet arrangement at night?" Harry asked again because he had to be careful because of the special status of the Fatima family, actually A person of great aristocracy like Harry believes in the same rumor. He thinks that the Fatima family is actually a branch of the royal family. This is an arrangement of the royal family. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new party has overthrew the old empire for twenty years, but people still have a good respect for the royal family, a royal family that has been in the rule for hundreds of years. It will not be completely removed from the hearts of people because of a "political revolution." On the contrary, there are still many people who still remember the past and are full of respect for the royal family. In addition, the New Party has been instilling the concept that the royal family is the spiritual symbol of the empire, and people are still very awesome to the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin ordered a cigarette and shook the window. "Arranged, all the local people with faces and faces will be there, and they will give a fee." Miss Ritz-Carlton has a present."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry has a headache again. The thing he hates most is surprise and fright, whether it is good or bad. "Stunning" means that there will always be something out of control and an accident will happen. As soon as he thought of Du Lin's consistent style, he had to ask this question clearly. Once he made any scandal, it would definitely be a heavy blow to his future promotion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Miss Felicia feels that she has been humiliated here, I am afraid that the Holy Lady will find him trouble. He blinked and whispered, "What gift?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said with a smile: "A chip, a pure gold chip, the denomination is one thousand, but the value of the chip itself is 20,000, and the number is still the first digit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that Du Lin said that Harry was relieved, he was really afraid that Du Lin would give Ferry to give a stone with a red ribbon. He had heard of this incident, and for a long time there was a bit of lol in front of the secretary for a long time, when he felt that this was the most interesting joke he had heard this year. Everyone who participated in the blasting ceremony was given a stone. This kind of thing is only what Du Lin can think of and can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry can even imagine the disgusting appearance of the guests. Is this broken thing lost, or is it not lost? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obvious that it’s time for him to face this unknown, and it’s obviously a little stressful, so Du Lin didn’t make any mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chip has become a very popular reputation as one of the "specialties" of the city of Otis. Many people will keep a few pieces after coming to the city of Otis. Five denomination chips, as a souvenir to Otis travel. The largest amount of chips currently in circulation in the city of Otis is the five hundred denominations of silver alloy, which is gone on top of it. Taking out a piece of pure gold is very commemorative, and the number of the first one has a special meaning, which is in line with the image that the city of Otis is currently building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is very good..." He hesitated. "Is there any more, give me one more?!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As governor, the benefits and value of the leaping development of Otis City also has one of his, but this one has been transformed into political achievements. What happened in the city of Otis was definitely the most dazzling one during his administration. He wants a gold chip to be arrogant. In the future, he will definitely leave here and rise to the center. With a gold chip, it will be a commemoration for himself. It is also a show. The value of the chip itself is second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not refuse, the 20,000 piece of BRIC is just a small sum of money for him now, he immediately nodded and said, "OK, Go back to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry sat in Doolin's office for a while and talked about the next development and planning of the city of Otis. In the process, Du Lin believed that the existing city scope was not enough, so he planned to continue to expand the city circle. A circle, a greater degree of rich urban core, enhance the adhesion of tourists. Of course, these places are still national. If you want to take these land, you need the approval of Harry and the State Land Resources Administration. Now it is just a gas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry is naturally impossible to stop, the better the development of Otis, the more radiant his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After chatting for about two hours, they drove back to the hotel and began to direct the hotel staff to arrange the dinner. Considering that the other party is one of the representatives and heirs of the top aristocrats like Fatima, Harry must personally be there to direct these people to how to meet the status and status of Miss Ferrika. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was eating something while watching Harry’s busy group turn, shaking his head and saying nothing. He saved a lot of things here, let him go to work alone. At this time, Buddha came over. He glanced at the fruit basket on the cold table, took an apple and took a bite and went to Doolin. I looked around and whispered: "Your brother, Mason, the guy called a phone call. He hopes that you can call back as soon as possible. It seems that the tone is a bit tight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded, turned and walked to the rest, locked the door from inside, and called Mason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason said something to wait, then he heard him leave, and the sound of closing the door, "Father told me to tell you, did you get any trouble?" In the past two days, several strangers appeared in the town and left in a circle. It is not like a passer-by, it seems to have any purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Doolin was not serious, but when he heard that someone had gone to his home, he immediately became awe. He frowned and thought about it. He hasn't provoked anyone recently, but anyone who has had a difficult relationship with him has been sent to see him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will it be the guy of Solo? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
