			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, a little bit...", a team member of the mine protection team ran over and whispered a few words in the ear of the mine guard team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original more than 60 carriages of this time almost filled the open space inside the door, and even a few horse-drawn carriages were blocked outside the gate, even the gate Can't close it. There are also horse-drawn carriages in the door. If you want to close the gate, you can't do it. These people are still squeezing inside, almost completely blocking the entire camp. If it is usually a small thing, it is obviously dangerous at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mine protection team glanced back at the team’s team leader and smoked two cigarettes, slightly raising their heads. “Let the last twenty carriages quit. Close the door, wait for the unloading inside and let the outside come in.", he will not get along with the team leader relationship during this time, pumping some cigarettes, and occasionally loading a few packets of cigarettes on his body. How much is lax. The captain who can become a member of this group of mine protection team, in addition to meeting the requirements of the mine owner, must have a heart that will never be relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can only enjoy this all the time when he is the captain. If one day he loses this position because of his fault, maybe these He cigarettes, and when he says good things, he will turn his face as soon as he turns around. Nothing is worthwhile, and there is no important mission and responsibility. This is the "experience" of the captain of the mine protection team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader’s expression remained the same, and he took the initiative to sip and let the grooms turn the horses as quickly as possible and drive the car out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commanded for a while, the leader suddenly said: "Sir, I have a younger brother. After studying for a few years, I know the words and I will calculate some simple numbers. He wants to find a job..." His words were not finished, and the captain of the mine guard knew what he meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mine is far from the city, and the work here is also dangerous, but overall it is quite ok. There is a higher salary than the factory. The cost of eating and drinking is paid by the mining company. There are no strict restrictions on personal freedom. As long as you can withstand loneliness, you can earn more money by working here than working elsewhere. I earn a lot more money. This is one of the reasons why many gold diggers finally became a mine protection team. They are not willing to take more risks to pursue the benefits that may not be encountered in a lifetime, and choose a relatively stable life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Western families with a way to find a way to stuff their children or relatives into the mining area, in the words of the West, even going out to the relatives are full of risks, what is the risk of the mining area? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the mine protection team turned and walked a few steps backwards, and the team leader followed closely. He did a lot of such things, but he was only responsible for it. Recommendation, the specific management problem is not his responsibility, and even if the other party comes, it may not be able to do it for a long time. The two left the center of the gate and went to the side. "How old is your brother this year, can you do heavy work? The work in the living area is not easy. If you can't suffer, it is best to let him go to other places to find a living."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living area is just a general statement. In fact, the ore is introduced into the living area by the slaves from the mine. The employees here need to crush the ore and Sorting, the workload is not too small, and it is not easy to live. Those ore are dozens or dozens of pounds. Their job is to throw these ores into the crusher for crushing, and then sort out the parts containing minerals with high repetition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highly repetitive work is very prone to fatigue, and it creates annoying psychological emotions. It is often not new to ask someone to take a vacation or resign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My brother is in good health and can suffer hard. He has to do something for himself. Isn't it? You can rest assured that his parents have let me put something for it. Transfer it to you as a reward for your help..." When the team leader spoke, the two men had already reached the edge of the canyon cliff, not far from the gate, but it was a blind spot in the perspective, not specifically concerned. It is difficult to notice the situation here. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team leader looked at the hand he had been in his pocket with the language guidance of the team leader and his movements to start pulling his arm. His arm pumping movement is very slow, and some squatting, which makes the captain of the mine guard team also slightly lower head, this is a kind of human instinct, nothing about his psychological changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, a dagger was pulled directly out of the team leader's pocket at a speed different from the previous slow-motion speed, and he was guarded by one arm. On the shoulder of the captain of the mine team, the dagger was sent to the captain of the mine guard team in the short one second of the other party’s fear. At this time, he also clung to the neck of the captain of the mine protection team, and the other hand held the arm of the captain of the mine protection team. After his short struggle, everything was calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team leader behaved like a good friend of the captain of the mine protection team. The two men stood back in the corner of the camp and talked with a whisper. Even if someone’s eyes swept here, there would be no More attention. Their attention is focused on those girls, how can they care about what their captain is doing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are not concerned about what their captain and team leader are doing, but some are concerned about the situation here. When the team leader took a hand and made a gesture of action, the noisy door seemed to be quiet for a moment, and it was short-lived that people did not seem to notice the difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty girls came down from the carriage, and the members of the mine protection team rushed to lead the girls to the living area. In their eyes, these girls were more than Gold can also attract their attention, and one can't wait to make things that are not as good as animals. The girls were wearing cloaks and still bowed their heads so that the guards could not see their looks. The more you can't see, the more itchy your heart, the more you want to be close to the girls who smell good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living conditions here are still quite good, but there are not many women. It is said that from time to time, some people will report that the mare has been violated. Some people saw that the captain and the leader were still talking, sneaking away from their duty, and walking into the living area behind these girls. In fact, they knew that these girls were technical girls. They appear here to use their extraordinary skills to solve the expansion problems that have been plaguing them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turter’s nephew deliberately packed up twenty separate rooms. When the girls just entered the room, they couldn’t wait for the guy to undo the belt and rush. Go in... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside, a carriage that was turning in the direction suddenly stopped, which made it impossible for the surrounding carriages to continue to turn around. The coachman shouted loudly. The smashed up, "The wheel of this carriage is broken. Can someone help me? Otherwise we can't continue to turn the front of the car!", he pointed at the wheel behind him, the wheel actually got out of the car skeleton and squatted aside Can't continue to turn. There are some slaves around, but the crowded scenes will take a while for the slaves to come. Some people look at the captain of the mine protection team standing in the corner with the team leader. He waved his hand and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gun guards who have been supervising the coaches in the vicinity have been glanced at each other, hanging their guns on their shoulders and walking together to stand by the car. I want to lift the carriage. However, the carriage filled with wheat kernels has at least two or three tons of weight, and is it that ten people can lift it? In addition to the coachman, they also called several of their nearest mine protection team members and worked hard to lift the carriage slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
