			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Doolin didn't pay attention, Zijing Town had a big news! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All are bastards!", Mr. Kesma looked at the hanging ribbons and balloons at the door of the town, and squinted with a black face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s eldest son arrived at the age of school, there is no primary school in Zizhen Town, especially Du Lin established for the Guar in the city of Tener. After a completely free full-time school, it is even more impossible to have a school in Zizhen Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very obvious way of taking advantage of the cheap, but this is the real society, the real life, for the people living at the bottom, can save a little It’s good, not to mention that there are nine years in elementary school, and even if you don’t spend money, you will spend a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Mr. Xiaoxma wants to leave Zizi Town, which makes all the people who know this news spread the news quickly, and everyone in the town I know this. They spontaneously prepared a farewell party and sent away Mr. Hollicard to leave Ziwei Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holikkad is the name of Mr. Xiaoxma, who is a little bigger. In the Guart language, Hollicard represents "a hot heart." "The name was taken by Mr. Kesma and did not get the consent of Du Lin." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six-year-old Mr. Hollicard is wearing a brand new small suit and standing in the doorway of the town. His eyes are red. He looks at the people who sent him. The eyes in the eyes fell and fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cheers of people are beginning to stop, and an unspeakable sadness is suddenly caused by these tears and spreads quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone hates Mr. Xiaoxma, but I have to say that Mr. Xiaoxma gave this calm to some deadly in the six years of Zijing Town. The town brings too much joy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like a pistachio, constantly plagued, causing the whole town to fly, but he has made the whole town active. People don't really hate him, so Mr. Xiaoxma knows that everyone knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of silence seems to be ridiculing the word "favorite", a child of the same age as Mr. Xiaoxma stood out from the crowd, he was hesitant Bring your favorite slingshot in your hand and hand it over. "Give you, take it with you, if the people in the city bully you, use this to play them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This slingshot is that Mr. Xiaoxma always wanted to grab it but did not succeed. Now, watching the little playmate who has been pitted several times, Mr. Xiaoxma endured the urge to cry, and deeply embraced it. Little friend, then nodded and slammed the slingshot into his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a signal, people have pulled out what Mr. Mazma likes from their pockets, as if they were ready . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Xmasma sighed silently, this group of bastards, this was not a sad thing, Mr. Knoxma just went to the city. Going to school, but giving them this way! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have the chance to do it, you must grab them and have a good meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewelling turned into a sad sea, the flood of flooding drowned, and people watched Mr. James meet with Born’s hand, then Watching the car disappear into the purple owl in the distance... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, let's have a drink for Mr. Knoxma's future!", Layton raised his glass and the whole town survived again, he sat On the shoulder of his wife, shouting loudly, "And we still have Mr. Little Mazma!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Ke, who was held by Mrs. Sma showed a sly smile... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in this slightly sentimental farewell party, there are people who are more sad because he has almost no sense of existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the younger brother of Doolin, Born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is Doolin’s youngest brother. He went to school at the age of the previous year, but Mr. Kemas thinks that the two children go to school together. It would be better to have a care, so Born, who was inexplicable, had more than two years of carefree life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for other brothers, in addition to Maska and Bondia who want to inherit all of Mr. Zema’s industries, the two sisters went to the school one step at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the car, just crying and a little tearful Mr. Xiaoxma quickly caught his tears, he began to sort out the town The good-hearted man gave him something. Bohn looked at the side with some eyes. After all, he was only an eight-year-old child. He couldn’t help but want to pick up a play for a while, but he was blinded by Mr. Xiaoxma. go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My!", he pointed to the various things piled up in the back seat, "All my, no you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born some He took back his hand, but when he thought that he was the uncle of this bastard, he should come up with the momentum of his elders. He immediately braved the courage and shouted, "We have already left the town, and no one will let you deliberately." You have to know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Bohn squinted and stopped talking, and the mouth of the stopper that was driving was slightly tilted, and nothing could be compared. The next generation of the Sima family is more energetic and it deserves to be happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the people in the town, are afraid that Mr. Xiaoxma will be bullied in the city? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a joke. In the city of Tener, Du Lin’s name is definitely better than the mayor’s, and it’s more useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Xiaoxma is very satisfied with Bonn’s knowledge, and he begins to carefully organize the property that belongs to him alone. He put the ones he liked together, and the others didn't like it on the other side. When the car drove into the city of Tener, he barely completed the classification work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Sethi, what is the school we go to school? Do we have to live in school?" Mr. Knoxma has been very mature and well-behaved since he entered the city of Tener. This has made it a little embarrassing for him to be fooled by him. The people of Kesma are all...all a little abnormal. The place? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to imagine that the little devil who can sit down in the town for fifteen seconds, except for sleeping, is so honest and well-behaved. Is it really so powerful? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While answering this philosophical question, he replied, "I will send you to Mr. Mason, who will arrange your daily life..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is Uncle Mason?", Xiaoxma behaved like a little adult. "I often hear people say that Uncle Mason is a very great person." The policeman, I am also very much looking forward to meeting Uncle Mason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born whispered a "hypocrisy" in front, he thought that Mr. Hear, but in fact he heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for the car to enter the police station. When the door opened, the two children jumped out and immediately caught the attention of many young police officers, especially those policewomen. Everyone knows that women don't have much resistance to cute things. Both children are very cute, especially Mr. Xiaoxma, who inherits the shortcomings of his father Du Lin and expresses himself very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, Mason took his forehead out, and then looked at the little Sigma, who was held by her policewoman in her arms, and felt a little hurt. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t had time to talk, and Mr. Knox’s eyes are filled with tears, jumping from the policewoman’s arms and rushing toward Mason. His legs, pointing to Bohn, sue, "Uncle Mason, Bohn said to give me a little color to see if he wants to hit me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mason frowned slightly, and glanced at Born, who had already witnessed the dog. "You are older than Card, and you are still his uncle. Do you think you are so suitable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason is the boss of the family. For those younger siblings who are much younger than him, his position in the family is second only to Mr. Kesma and Kesma. Madame, this was reprimanded by Mason. Born’s words that he wanted to refute were blocked in his mouth, and his eyes squinted at Mr. Xiaoxma’s secretly grimacing at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mmp! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Bohn decided to let the content of Mr. Xiaoxma’s complaint become a fact, but he quickly realized that he should not be too Savage, it is better to reason when it comes to reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially for this bastard who can make the whole town fly, it is a jerk like his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Dulin’s jerk, it’s not important. Mr. Kesma said that he is a jerk, then he is a jerk, and the bastard will be inherited! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracted his gaze and patted Mr. Xiaoxma’s shoulder and sent him to the side, then said something to Sethi and gave After he had some money, he said goodbye to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sethi, "Mr. Racing" has been staying in the town since he was older, and he has not sent any letters to the post office. His main job now is in the city. When Mr. Ma was in need, he drove the car to Mr. Xema. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
