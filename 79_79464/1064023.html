			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something difficult between the Buddha and Vivian to help them make any decisions. They are not married, and the gap between status and social status is huge. A child. If there is no such situation, then they will return to their normal track, just like two parallel lines that will never intersect. But with this child, everything has become a bit different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents are not self-sufficient for their children, they must be selfless to love, they are not perverted, Vivienne is not, they want to give the children the most Good things, but they can't give the most important thing, a complete family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Du Lin’s point of view, the birth of this child is a mistake. Of course, he also has the responsibility. If he did not use Vivienne’s weakness, he wanted to overthrow Peter. The mayor will not have so many follow-ups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how to deal with things between you, so don't ask me, please!", Du Lin took a sip of iced drinks. He leaned back and sat up. "I really can't make any decisions instead of you. If you don't see who is uncomfortable, I will help you kill him, then you don't bother me. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha’s mouth was pumping. "I’m not talking about this. Just now there was news from Orodo, Alisa. Discharged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa was frightened some time ago, affecting the condition of the fetus in the abdomen, once very dangerous. Fortunately, Doolin is willing to spend money, and a group of medical groups willing to make money, after spending more than 50,000 yuan, finally stabilized the situation, and successfully gave birth to a girl last month, Doolin's second Children, a little angel. It may be that the child was prematurely affected by external factors before the birth, and there was a problem with the body, which was stuck in the hospital until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, the hospital’s expert group believes that adults and children are no longer problematic and are allowed to leave the hospital. When Alisa was discharged from the hospital, someone told the Buddha to let him tell Du Lin. Now Savi personally brought a combat group back to Orodo to protect Du Lin's daughter to avoid the last time. Of course, they don't know that the last time Mr. and Mr. Zema robbed Mr. Xiaoxma, they have already gone to hell - including their boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was thinking about the things of Alisa and her daughter. I accidentally saw a trace of the edge of the Buddha's mouth. He suddenly woke up. "You want me to come back to Orodo with you, so I found a Such a reason?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocratic school where the son of Buddha is to board is in Orodo, which means that the Buddha wants to go back, but there is a little struggle. Finally thought of a way to let Du Lin go back with him. He did not deny this. He readily nodded and admitted. "That's it. I knew I couldn't lie to you at the beginning. We went back together and then came back together. I should go and have a look, even if I didn't attend the opening ceremony." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at him and then rolled his legs to the ground. He was thinking about returning to the right now, and soon he made a decision. Leaving the West now is probably the best option. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the squeeze of the Southern Commercial Bank and the Imperial Central Bank, he has done the best, but the South Bank and the Imperial Bank, which do not admit defeat, will definitely catch up. In addition to the escalation of conflicts in the robbing of contracts, interference from outside the body will gradually emerge. Just like the widest truth circulating in the circle of lawyers, the decisive victory is always outside the court. In the case of competing for contracts, the final victory is not for themselves, but for those outside them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southern Commercial Bank, Imperial Bank, including other financial institutions will definitely find ways to contact people who can influence Doolin in their personal connections, and interfere with competition through these people. Order and fairness, if the people of the imperial central bank contact Du Lin through the cabinet cabinet, and talk to him about the conditions, he is giving the right side or not giving face. If that person is Magus, is Doolin giving face or not giving face? At this time, the decisive victory is also outside the incident. Instead of taking the initiative to become passive, it is better to pick it up first and let people not find themselves. When those people have acquired enough contracts, when the time comes, it is better to sit directly at the negotiating table than to wait here to be disturbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he really needs to go somewhere else, like Irian. Science Island has already built a factory in the sixth district, and began to produce signal receiving decoders. The launch of television is imminent. As a product that changes the times, it takes for granted a grand conference, Du Lin should attend. With the promotion of Major General Thomas, he has become a resident general of the Irian Naval Base, and Du Lin will also give him a big gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a lot to do, Du Lin shot a thigh and nodded, "Oh, let's go, just I have to go back home." ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was a person who said that he did it. He did not have any procrastination. In the morning, he made a decision. At noon, he called people to assign the next task. In the afternoon, he and Dudu sat on the trip to Ordo. The train, for this reason, Ms. Catalina's attitude towards Du Lin is a bit worse, because his decision will miss this month's party. Fortunately, Du Lin introduced Henry to Katerina, letting Catalina and Henry go to the party together, and it was blocked by the woman's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the steam locomotive slowly stopping at the station, a large amount of water vapor is ejected through the pressure relief hole, and the station is in a fog for a while, about a dozen seconds. time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin and Du Fu were light and simple, and they came out of the first class with their hands empty. Well, now called Business Class. Under the influence of the provincial sages shouting "class discrimination", the title of "class discrimination" in the first class has been changed to "business class". The provincial sages are really omnipotent, there are always points where they can find battles, and they quickly pick up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where do you go now?", all of them took out a pack of cigarettes and gave Du Lin a pair of two people like ordinary people. I stood in the station and got together and lit fire. There was no such thing as a tycoon. Not far from them, they followed eight bodyguards, faintly guarding them in the middle. Now even the Buddha is used to being protected. In any case, in the eyes of many people, it is the second person of the Doolin family. It is really a big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a sigh of relief. "Go first to see my little angel, then tomorrow we will join your son's opening ceremony.", Doolin It has become more clear that this is a kidnapping, and the abduction of the red fruit is to let him join him at the opening ceremony. Of course, in order to do something for Du Lin, Du Lin is not disgusted. They are a family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the city, Alisa is a little weak in bed, the little girl who falls asleep in her arms is her whole world, in her There is only her in her eyes, and the strong maternal love almost flows out of her eyes. She glared at the little bit of a name but a soothing tone, her eyes fixed firmly on the girl's body, her face full of happy expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was knocked at this time, and Mr. Bain’s words came from outside the door. “Can I come in?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa raised her head and replied, and answered, "Yes, come in, father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
