			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out at the rough sea outside the window, suddenly Amp thought of what Du Lin said in front of his grave, one of which made him remember, especially in At this time, this sentence has poured from the bottom of my heart for no reason, and it has come to my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not really what he heard. When he knew that Kevin had gone to the cemetery to present his tombstones, he arranged a person to stay there. Waiting for the emergence of "miracle". In the vicious cases that Amp has cracked in the past, there are some high-intellectual criminal geniuses. These criminal geniuses seem to be no different from ordinary people. Some even make people feel unfettered and intimate, just like their loved ones or neighbor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But under their ordinary mask is an arrogant heart, they look down on everyone, including the victims killed by them and the police who detected the case . Such people have a pathological pride that they can't say, and they often confide in the losers after winning one victory. This is not a confession, but a contemptuous attitude. Tell the victims and even the police why they lost, where they lost, and the arrogance in their bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he arranged for people to be in the cemetery, maybe when Du Lin also ran over and opened up and talked to a dead person who could not threaten himself. Criminal things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited for Doolin, but did not wait for what he needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood in front of his grave, fiddling the fallen leaves on the tombstone, and personally presented a bouquet of flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that when justice must be built in a destructive way, the destruction itself is not sinful, the evil is those that hinder fairness. The people who have come to justice, and the rules they have set... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is still fresh in Amp, as Du Lin said, this talent that has been undermining is the existence of justice in people’s eyes, and it is a A sad performer can only loop infinitely in a circle of people's paintings, but can never find evidence outside the circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin reminded him, so he decided to use Du Lin’s way to send Du Lin to the penalty platform – with the crime he committed enough to After hanged, it was exposed for three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of power to use the rules beyond the rules and regulations has made everything smooth, he shook his head like a smile, he knew that he was eventually "infected" by Doolin. The power of power is really addictive, especially destructive power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 3:20, the door knocked and Amp replaced a happy expression and opened the door of the room. There were some shoulders and corners. Mr. Tucks, who was on the rain, stood outside the door. "You can finally come, have you had trouble on the road?", he took the coat that Mr. Tucks took off, hung on the hanger, and invited Tucks. The gentleman walked into the living room of the suite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sitting down, Mr. Tucks wiped some damp hair with a dry towel. He nodded. "Yes, I just got off the boat." It started to rain. I didn’t come back for several years. I didn’t expect Montrell to become so prosperous. I almost lost my way. Fortunately, the kind taxi driver sent me here, although he overcharged me a dollar.”, from Tucker Mr. Si’s face does not see any irritating look for him. For a person like him, the money is no different from the penny in the pocket of an ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He placed the towel on the coffee table and leaned back on the back of the sofa, watching Amp ask, "You said that there are important things, Can you tell me what is it now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp nodded, he didn't intend to hide anything, as he had considered at the beginning, he already I don't plan to follow some pedantic rules anymore. Du Lin killed him once, he can be regarded as a punishment that must be accepted by a game loser, but Du Lin killed Anna, which is something he can't tolerate. Although there is still no accurate statement on the side of Tnell until now, it is not clear who killed Anna, but Amp has a very keen instinct. This person must be Du Lin undoubtedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Du Lin was able to have such power in the city of Tener, killing anyone without alarming anyone, so now Du Lin pays for it. when. As he has always said, everyone has to pay for his actions, and no one can escape this "truth." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before I say what I am going to do, I must apologize to you for some things I have previously concealed, Tucks, sincere apology. I deceived you. In fact, I am a detective who is responsible for detecting and handling important cases. I am asking you to come back this time because I think Mr. Doolin has a very serious crime. This requires your help. I can get one. Strong evidence to form a complete chain of evidence.” Amp said very sincerely, no matter whether Mr. Tucks is willing to cooperate, he must cooperate, because here is the territory of the empire, where the official will is above all else. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Tucks lost his mind for a while before asking, "I really didn't think that Mr. Doolin would actually be related to crime. Is there anything I need to help? As long as I can do it, I will try my best to help you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp nodded, this is the value he brought to the Federation several times and almost caught in the federal back, he and Tucks Mr. became a good friend. There is nothing more sensible than Mr. Tucks. "Yes, can you recall that when Du Lin came to see you, did he already have a batch of gold in his hand?" Mr. Tucks seriously remembered for a while before he nodded. "It is indeed, but I can't prove that the gold comes from other places, or belongs to someone else." Is this also useful to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp laughed, "Of course it is useful, any lie has a day that has been exposed, and you know, eventually It’s not me, or the judge, who decides that Doolin is guilty...but the jury...”<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Ampu said, it is not his amp that determines whether Du Lin is guilty, nor the judges who are high in the court, but those who have no culture and no interest. group. As long as it can be proved that Du Lin left Tener and settled in Irian and held gold in his hands, it was enough for some jury members to associate the gold in Doolin with the 30 million gold that Ternell was missing. Du Lin was very To a large extent, they will be considered guilty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, only such evidence is not enough. Amp and Mr. Tucker talked for a long time, no matter how big the matter, as long as he He will ask if he thinks it is valuable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation lasted for more than an hour, and when Mr. Tucks was willing to call the previous accountant, Amp was really relieved. The chances of having Mr. Tucker's cooperation with Du Lin being guilty are much greater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Tucks made a phone call in the living room, dialing directly to him when he and Du Lin partnered to do business, how much per month? The gold, silver and gems of money, as well as how many things are sold each month, the accountant has a complete record, and every income or expenditure is recorded on the ledger. Later, because of the accountant's nephew, and the warehouse administrator had a little accident at work, Du Lin dismissed the accountant and warehouse administrator and replaced him with someone familiar with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after Mr. Tucks said a few words, he put down the phone. He walked back to the sofa and re-settled. Some regrets said: "Mr. Accountant is not at home for the time being, his family will tell me the information left. I will call back at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your help, I don't know what to say!", Amp held tightly. Mr. Tucks’s hand, “I arranged a table at night, we will have dinner together later, how? The steak here is very good, you will love it. I’ve been tired of you for so long, you have to take a break, I wait I will come to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After exiting the suite, Amp enters another suite directly opposite, with several people sitting in the suite, and The guard stared at the side. What surprised Amp was that the only woman here was actually a big belly. This was beyond his plan. He didn't know that Alisa was pregnant again. It also made things a bit more troublesome. He adjusted his emotions and walked into the living room. When everyone's eyes were focused on him, he coughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very sorry to invite everyone here. First of all, I will introduce myself. My name is Amp, a senior agent of the Imperial Bureau of Investigation. I came here to investigate the Thyle gold robbery that year. So I hope everyone can cooperate with me, especially you, Ms. Alisa." He once again glanced at Alisa’s raised belly. I quickly regained my gaze. "Gentlemen, I have arranged dinner for everyone. It should be almost time for dinner. You can go to dinner first. I still have some words to talk to Ms. Alisa alone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of what amp said, the guards around them who are not able to deal with the guns make them very interesting and do not make any irrational actions." Come, when these people left, Amp sat across from some fearful Alisa, his eyes staring at Alisa's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I didn't guess wrong, is the child in your stomach, Doolin?", the reason why he is so sure is the material collected. In the middle of last year, he discovered that Alisa’s father reported to the local police station in Ordoto that his daughter had disappeared. A month later, Alisa returned to Orodo, and his father withdrew the case. Since then, Alisa has not registered to marry any man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this society, although many things are very open, but unmarried pregnancies and even engagements are not held, the same is a matter of challenging morality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
