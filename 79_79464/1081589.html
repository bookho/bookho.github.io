			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the scene has some solidification, and Angelo’s cockroaches are gone. He doesn’t know if Du Lin is really stupid or stupid. More likely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time shows the importance of a female character with a good skill in the negotiation. With a crisp crash, people’s eyes are focused on Tia's body. She smiled a little embarrassedly. "My knife has fallen...", saying that he wants to move the chair and bend down to kneel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya's clothes are gorgeous, but also bold, in line with the aesthetics of the nobility. On the one hand, they hope that the sacredness of women is as pure as an angel, so that people can't breed a defiled mentality. Even if they don't wear clothes, they can let people kneel under their feet and pray for the good and beautiful. On the one hand, I hope that every woman is a mother-in-law who swings around the waist below the waist and crawls around the waist. Looking for genetic material to use the breeding of species and the continuation of life as an excuse to simply enjoy the fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually a good joke, but it is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clothes on the side of Natiya are very wide. When she bends down, Du Lin sees the universe and is all-encompassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this falling knife doesn’t seem so easy to pick up. Natiya hasn’t picked it up several times, maybe a little far away, she’s I only held it on Doolin's leg, and continued to work hard to find it under the table until a piece of heating came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry...", seemingly aware of what she did, Natiya blushes her face and puts the knife back on the table, she shows The shame and the blush on the face can definitely soften the attitude of any man, and Du Lin is also. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hit a ring and the Buddha standing at the door of the distance came over. "Let the restaurant replace a set of tableware for Ms. Natiya." Then he looked at Natiya. "It's very easy. There is no need to be so troublesome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natya can say anything but thank you, of course Du Lin Still a very gentle person, he did not have too much entanglement on this issue. Natiya is not the "protagonist" tonight, Angelo is, this poor woman is just a tool to adjust the atmosphere when necessary, she is very poor, worthy of a superfluous like Du Lin The feelings pinch the word of compassion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's get the topic back on the right path, Mr. Angelo, I actually believe that you should already be very clear. Yesterday, the twins of Hill's family have met me. I have not made any promises. On the one hand, because our lawsuits are going on, on the other hand, they are far from the price I expected." He raised his wrist and glanced at the watch. "We are all very busy people. There are some things that should be said more clearly. What do you want, what you can pay, and then convince me to accept your offer, is such a simple matter, what do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Anglio thought about it. On the table, except for Du Lin, the four people quickly passed their eyes to convey some simple information. After a moment, Anglio laughed. "You said very much. Yes, Mr. Doolin, we should be more honest. So...", he held his chin and continued to think about it. Du Lin’s directness made him a little unprepared. It’s like getting used to tempting each other in language and making puzzles. The people who are circling suddenly have to face each other directly, and there will always be some incompatibility. "We assume that you can win these three lawsuits..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No!", Doolin interrupted his words. "It is not a hypothesis, I am sure I can win these three lawsuits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anglio I smiled and didn't care about the gap between these words. "Okay, you can definitely win, and we also understand the words more clearly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is exactly what I hope for." Du Lin raised the wine glass as a sincere compliment to Angelo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After responding to Doolin and also toasting, Angelo continued, "Southern Commercial Bank hopes to get a certain patent from Mr. Doolin. Right, we need to ensure that we have tickets for this area, and we also need to ensure the security of all our previous investments. I know that empowerment and ownership are two different things. I also believe that Mr. Doolin understands what I mean. I have two offers now, maybe you will find what you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first offer, our two insurance companies cross-share, you get The shareholding is divided into two parts. The first part will be the transfer fee for part of the patent right, one-time acquisition of a certain shareholding, and the other part is equivalent to the equity of our exchange of shares. In this way, the head office of the South Bank can ensure the security of all our investments. You can also become a better business partner with Mr. Doolin, which has a positive effect on regulating the entire industry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second offer, the transfer of not less than 35 percent of the patent rights to Southern Commercial Bank, we can provide 60 million cash payment for this patent, or 150 million in 15 years Payment method. Please believe me, this is a very sincere offer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two quotations are also quotations that Nanshang Bank thinks are in line with the current situation. The former can get enough patents without paying a penny, and then offset the equity in Du Lin’s hands through various means such as financing and stock increase, so that he does not have any say in the board of directors, and then he has one more foot. Kick him out. Although the South Commercial Bank is not as good as the Imperial Central Bank, the liquidity they own will be several times or even dozens of times more than Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second quotation will lose a sum of money in a short period of time, but it does not need to play with certain risky commercial means to directly buy out part of the patent right. Locking up their position in the industry, the rest is to look at their own skills to develop desperately. Southern Commercial Bank's internal think tank believes that even if both sides stand on the same starting line, Du Lin is definitely not a Southcomer, including the central bank's opponents. Because Du Lin lacks enough "capital", it is estimated customers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operations department of the Southern Commercial Bank has made a careful plan. Once it is determined that the South Commercial Bank is qualified to operate the insurance business, they will immediately deposit more than one hundred yuan. The user of the block will give a one-year injury insurance for three consecutive years, which is completely free! This is enough to push tens of millions of users to directly select the insurance company of Nanshang Bank as the first insurance company. The same is true of the imperial central bank. They directly rip the entire market of the empire into three parts, two large and small ones, each holding a large share, and then the three are competing for the small one. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Du Lin will still be squeezed out of this market by them, under the pressure of the two major banks, he can not find any living space! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Angelo is not afraid of Dulin bargaining, I am afraid he does not agree. As long as he promises, there must be a way to eliminate Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought for a moment, nodded, and a smile on his face. "I have to say, Mr. Angelo, the sincerity of the South Business Bank." And the attitude is much better than the central bank, and it is more satisfying. But satisfaction does not mean satisfaction, maybe we can raise the price of the buyout, I think that one-time payment of 150 million for a patent of 25% Right is a good price, what do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angelo thought about it. "Mr. Doolin, your request is a bit too much. I believe that it is impossible for any consortium in the empire to take out 150 million yuan in one lump sum. If you are willing to accept instalments, I can go directly here and raise the installment price to 200 million, and pay for it in eight years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All bankers are well aware of the benefits of installment because of the currency It will always be depreciating. Ten years later, 10 million may be only four or five million. The longer the period is, the larger the amount, and the smaller the bank's losses. This is also why the loan from the bank, the longer the loan, the more amazing the interest rate, and even horrible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the loan is one million, the interest on the loan for ten years may be only a dozen percent, but the loan itself may be close to the principal, for 30 years. Banks are not fools, they will not do a loss-making business, this is one of the ways for banks to make money - those savings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can reduce five million, but I only have one request, that is cash.", Doolin continues to show his position, which makes Anglio A lot of comfort, a clear attitude and position, the next step is to play with each other and be nonsense, to see who can hold it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the two sides began to compete fiercely about the amount, payment method and transfer of patent rights. Natiya is constantly interspersed with gunpowder. During the negotiation process, the scene did not go out of control once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the negotiations, Natiya gave Du Lin the greatest affection and maximum comfort for all women until now, even if she is not the most beautiful, temperament Not the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 11:17 pm, the final price of the two parties is finally infinitely close to the point acceptable to both parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a new idea, don't you know if Mr. Angelo would like to hear it?" Du Lin was a little tired of picking up a cigarette. Everyone on the table also ate a lot of food. The long-term negotiation was not only mentally sleepy, but also caused physical fatigue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya immediately took out a delicate red lighter and set fire for Du Lin, this is her twelfth time for Doolin. I don’t want to thank Du Lin’s more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anglio is also a little tired, he is strong in spirits, and his eyes are the same as the eyes of dead fish, sitting up straight, "said Let us refer to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
