			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several people sat down, Graf once again said that he had troubled his troubles, and he smiled and ordered a cigarette. It’s a little thing, you can know the result at night.” After he finished looking at Du Lin, this sentence is actually what Du Lin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing for Graf is insignificant for them now, and can even be solved by a phone call. They are all curious as to why Du Lin will come to see him personally. He knows how busy there is in the city of Otis. Although it is now inseparable from Ordo, it does not mean that he does not pay attention to the situation there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the mixed years with Du Lin, his status and vision have improved. It can be said that he is not the little punk a few years ago. He is already a "tycoon". There are millions of dividends in these years, and more money than many of the so-called rich people in Oro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his hand and pressed it on Graf's shoulder. They all smiled and nodded. He understood what Du Lin meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glave, although leaving this circle, does not mean that Doolin has forgotten him, and treated him as an ordinary person. Du Lin still regards Graf as Your own good brother. This is also the place where all Buddhas admire Doolin. He is not too vicious for anyone outside, but he never gives anyone a chance to pick a thorn. The brothers who died in Doolin's early rise, Doolin will give his family five hundred pieces a month, which is much more than he promised. [Non, don't explain]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because people have integrity, they can stand firm, which is why everyone is willing to work for Doolin. He never puts himself in the first place, there is always only one whole in that position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?", Buddha asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin came to his own way on the road, as the Buddha said, this is a small matter, "call the point, then find Graf Brother, or what else can you do? Negotiation?", he snorted and laughed. Both Buddha and Vivian were laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiation? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mayor and a group of sub-committed social sub-committees that are not yet in the stream? It really is too much to lift the identity of the other party, for this kind of guy to be simple and rude can be done, there is no need to be so troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half an hour later, Pete, the president of the Ordos Association, arrived at the Governor's Office with a dozen talents. Pete was the leader of the branch who was promoted from Tenell. His brother had died for Du Lin, and with his own excellent execution and understanding, Du Lin gave him a little bit of waiting to be promoted to the president of the Ordos Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boss!", Pete is very respectful to Doolin. After all, Du Lin changed the fate of his family. Now his family still lives old. On the street, the house has been rebuilt and revived, and enjoys the kind of “quality” life that the upper class said. Then he and Dudu greeted him and finally looked at Graf. He didn't know this guy, but he reached out very friendly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You sit!", Du Lin pressed his hand. "There is something you need to do. Go to the twenty-third street, No. 22, that is A casino, grab the people inside and send them to our warehouse at the dock. We will pass later. The other hand is likely to have weapons. You must take a gun and remember to wear bulletproof vests. If the resistance is fierce..." Du Lin smiled. "Leave one or two to talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitt just sat down and stood up, "boss, me Go now, what else do you need to order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and shook his head, and he stood up and took out the cigarette case and took out a The smoke was lost, and a lighter was picked up from the palm of the Buddha's hand. When Pete's body began to tremble, the lighter was put to his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slamming sound, the pure copper lighter cover opened and the crisp vibration sounded. This is a kind of sounding lighter, which has become popular since this year. Celebrities in the upper class are very fond of this lighter that will "sing". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitt quickly reacted, he slammed the cigarette on his mouth, covered his hands with the lighter, prevented the wind from blowing out, and carefully lit the cigarette. , took a deep breath. He never thought that cigarettes would have such a "delicious" day, and the mellow fragrance made him suspect that he had been faked before. But he sneaked a sneak peek at the trademark on the cigarette butt, and he usually smoked a brand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin patted him on the shoulder. "Your brother is a great person, I hope you can be a great person!", he pinched Pinch Pete's arm, "Do it well, the team leader is definitely not the end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Pitt walked with the pace, Du Lin shrugged. "I will always remember the day his brother died for me." This is what I owe them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitt left the gate of the Governor’s House, feeling the sky is blue, the clouds are white, and even the roadside bricks The unyielding grass is green, and it has never made him feel so beautiful in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team leader may be only a slightly higher level in the fellowship, but everyone knows that after the position of the leader, the identity and status will be completely different. Maybe you can't see anything in your daily life, but it's definitely not just a simple name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commonly speaking, if the fellowship is regarded as a company and all members are basic employees, then the leader is middle management. Within the terms of his authority, he can make his own plans, have more freedom, enjoy better benefits and benefits, and of course take on more responsibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as nothing in the world, and what has been paid at the moment of harvest, greater power, more responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orodore, or Cannes is the place where Doolin started and is the best place to run, and Pete’s jumping out of the way makes him The people who brought it saw some clues and asked questions on the way. He finally couldn’t help but smile and said it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people walked one by one and licked his hair in his head. His age is not the biggest, it can even be said to be relatively small. . These people and most of them are neighbors, or live on a street, or may be intimate with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, everyone knows that they can stop, but they have to stop, but they have a request, that is, Pete must ask them to drink a meal, everyone . Although there was a bit of pain, he was very happy to agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as Du Lin and Dufo think, this is only a trivial matter, so small that it can no longer be small. After taking the line of sight back out of the window, Du Lin smiled and shook his head, sitting on the sofa, his legs, his eyes fixed on the faces of both the Buddha and Vivian, and they all had some incomprehensibleness and no When I was so happy, Du Lin asked: "Are you planning to get married?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This awkward topic suddenly made Vivian a little restless, and the Buddha also showed a sly smile, "boss..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha wants to explain what, Du Lin waved his hand and stopped him. "I am not asking for accountability, nor is it coming to you for trouble, but I really want to ask if you have any plans to get married. Everyone must have such a The process, from one person to many individuals, is a responsibility of society and a responsibility of oneself. There is nothing to be embarrassed. If you are going to get married, I will bless you and have a big gift."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't plan to get married, then I want to ask, is there anything I can do to help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Dusit’s smile a few times and moved to Doolin’s side. “I can ask, are you going to send something?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vivian’s eyes are bright, she already knows what horrible industry Du Lin has now, and she has a little bit Curious, if they are really married, what will Du Lin send? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I found out that the empire did not have any plans for the offshore islands, so..." he laughed. "I am going to send you an island!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that the society has not yet noticed the special economic value of the island, so dozens of islands off the east coast of the empire are still in the original ecological environment. Du Lin has already spent a sum of money to buy these islands. It may not be useful to see these islands now, but Du Lin believes that these two islands will become a very important strategic resource after 20 years and 30 years later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is true both at the national level and from your own planning chain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Island?", all sighed and looked disappointed. "I thought there would be a statue of pure gold, or something else!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin reached out and beat the Buddha, and the Buddha was very agile to hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weiweian sitting behind her face was laughing, but her eyes flashed a bit because they couldn’t get married. Regardless of the fact that the two men are very different, only her late husband is Peter and there is no way for her to have any thoughts in a short time. The horrific degree of this thing Vivienne has profoundly realized that she should not only consider for herself, but also consider it for the Buddha, and also consider the honor left by the Governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
