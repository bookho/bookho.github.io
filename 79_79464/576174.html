			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can't do it, then return the name to me, I will go to the warden to say this.", Delil flipped his wrist The palms up, turned a blank eye, and looked at the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando has begun to curse, but his face still maintains the style of his own police chief, he opened the drawer, and his hand was pressed on the famous post. But it didn't come out, "Even if I give it to you, you will not see the three people when you see the warden."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delier Not just entering the ignorant sissy of the society, he sneered, still looking at the ceiling, "You can not give me, but I can go to Mrs. Vivian for another one, I will take what I have encountered here. Everything tells her. I think, maybe she will be very unhappy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence makes Prando raise his arm, he took the name The post was placed on the table, but it was still not handed to Delier. He still needs to work harder. "I am very sorry. I still don't know what you call... Delier? Ok, Delier. First... live, I can return the name to you, but have you considered how you can find the warden? You are sure you know how Does the warden deal with?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a barbaric man, he is very dangerous and rude. Not as good as...", Prando The brain was turning at a high speed when his wife found it. If he was close to his head, he put his ear on his scalp and even heard the squeak of the brain when he was spinning. "I took you and held it. This famous post, go to the warden together, and then I will persuade him to agree with your request. After all, your request is to take the person who belongs to him on his site, which is also rude to him. Behavior, what do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more and more smooth Prando’s face has a smile, "You should have heard that the prisoners are all The prison chief is the king, then the prisoners are actually the king's people, so this thing needs to be communicated. I have some relationship with the warden, and I should be able to talk about him, then you will have a chance to make this breath! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delier hesitated, most Still nodded, "But you have to hurry, I have to go back to see Mrs. Vivian before 5 pm, and it will definitely not be me if I miss my time."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem!", Prando sighed in relief. He handed the signature to Delier and also came out from behind the table. "You sit for a while, I Go and arrange a job. For up to five minutes, we will leave and take my police car."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Delil reached his goal, he did not want to make trouble. He sat quietly on the side of the bar and poured a glass of wine under the warm reception of Prando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sitting is almost ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando immediately found an old police officer who was familiar with him after he left the office. He didn’t dare to find a young police officer because he understood these Young people who have just transferred from the police school or from the army have a sense of justice that is speechless. When the police need a sense of justice, but also to see when, every moment, the sense of justice can only be bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would they send away?" After the two walked up the stairs on the first floor, Prando asked. The old police officer nodded his head and responded to him. Cod and his party walked for about an hour or so. This answer made Prando completely relieved. From the police station to the district prison, it is necessary to cross the entire city, leave the city and continue to walk about 20 kilometers or so before going to the periphery of the prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the escorted vehicle is not fast, not the road is not good, nor the car is not good, there is actually another gray rule. Sometimes some prisoners are on their way to the prison, and there will be relatives or friends of the prisoners or even the superiors in the gang waiting on the side of the road. They will explain some things to the prisoner, or caress the prisoner's emotions, and in the course of this offending rule, will also give some benefits to the police responsible for escorting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money is the most common, when it is less than twenty or thirty, when it is more than thirty or fifty, or even hundreds, in addition to cigarettes And wine can be taken. Escaping a prisoner is a job with a lot of oil and water, so how slow these police officers can drive on the road, can't wait for a year and a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a time, they should be out of town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando immediately looked around and shook his voice and said: "You go to Codor immediately and tell him that something has changed, let He went to stop the escorted car, and then smashed the three guys, at least people couldn’t see them, you followed him.” He patted the old policeman’s shoulder hard, the tiger’s mouth pressed I squeezed it slightly on the other's back neck. "Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old police officer looked at him and tried his head. "I understand Now, look for Codor to go and see the three guys beyond recognition. I am with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
