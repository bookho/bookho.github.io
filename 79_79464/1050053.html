			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the introduction of Angela, Du Lin is more and more sure that the gods must be engaged in what they can’t do. Everything here is to satisfy the vast majority of people. The desire was established, and he also found one of the sources of the income of the gods. It is not like Henry said that he does not need to spend any penny... but he is actually right, no money, But Du Lin believes that anyone who walks in here will definitely spend money and spend a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this region of the heavenly kingdom in the eight regions, all other regions are basically associated with money. For example, Angela first introduced the tearing valley, which is a place similar to the Colosseum. Tusiism “recruited” a group of young and strong young people from other countries, and some of them were cultivated by Tushen. These young people don't need to worry about anything. All they need to do is have a strong body and excellent cold weapon fighting ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at least 12 battles per month, and there are about 20 games at most. These young people were placed in a canyon-like place where they faced Gobi wolves, black lions and even ferocious predators from other places. The guests sit on the canyon, they can choose not to do anything, watch the warriors tear all the cruel predators, or the predators shred the weak warriors, so the name of this area is called The Valley of Tears, no matter who rips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are also games that can be used for a small amount of money. The simplest thing in the same field is to bet on the bet. Every warrior must face three levels. There will be three Gobi wolves in the first level. These Gobi wolves are always in a state of fullness. They will suffer a little bit of treatment before they are put into the canyon. The believers will insert them on the backs of these Gobi wolves or their necks. One or more metal pins. These metal needles are not thick, very thin, and not long, but after piercing the Gobi wolf's body, any movement of the Gobi wolf will bring pain, which will make the Gobi wolf become violent and more aggressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first pass is the second pass, and will be a black-haired lion who has been hungry for two days. The power of hunger is enough to promote this western predation. The top predator of animals treats all living things as food. The murder of the black-haired lion is definitely not comparable to the Gobi Wolf, although some so-called well-known biologists have been calling on everyone not to feed the wild animals in the west and avoid the instinct of hunting for these predators, but that is definitely a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For predators, hunting is instinct, not a technique, and it is absolutely impossible to be forgotten, especially after being hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third level is the wolves, and twelve Gobi wolves who have been hungry for three days will be thrown into the canyon to fight the warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like a feeling that human beings can't beat these animals, and although this is part of the truth, there are actually many people who can make a success. The training they have received for a long time is aimed at the customs, plus they have enough equipment and a sharp sword, there will always be people who will continue to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, if there is a guest who is not interested in watching, you can pay for the fourth level and let the battle continue to upgrade. You can also buy some "supplies" for people to throw into the canyon, such as armor, long guns, torches or even grenade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an interesting place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin seems to have also discovered how the Tushenism has swayed these people and even limited the control of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first went to Shen Yu, a very ceremonial place, in a very large cave with many small single rooms, each small studio It’s probably only about 20 square meters, there are some shelves inside, nothing on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin entered the room, a priest wearing a white robe came in. They were the lowest-ranking priests, but they were also the most devout. God official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel the will of the Mother Earth to serve you, what do you want to do?", the large cloak and hood will complete this priest Hidden, he lowered his head, Du Lin could not see him, his voice should sound like thirty years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat on the only sofa in the room, and Angela stood behind him. "I first participated in this game, what can I do?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, this is not a game, it is a sentiment, it is a tempering of the soul. The Mother Earth is compassionate, she knows that living in this dirty We have a lot of distress and a lot of pain in the world, so she lowered her will to let us build here. Here you can want to do whatever you want, to vent all the grievances and unwillingness in your heart, as long as you can The mind restores the initial calm to the maximum, which is what we should do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this priest's explanation, Du Lin still did not understand, what was called the initial calm, and how to vent all the negative emotions in the heart, he thought, asked, "So what should I do? Specifically, I am not coming to guess the mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest was silent for a moment before he whispered, "Some people have a tragic childhood, they have been persecuted by some people and even Abuse, this will become an obstacle in the process of sublimation of their souls. Only by thoroughly venting it can we eliminate this obstacle. To help these guests, we have provided some people who have abused him, and let him fear and anger in his heart. Hate and resentment are released."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone is full of some obsession with money, but he does not have the qualification to have too much money, here, we Will provide enough cash to fill the entire room, so that he can face the endless money is also very calm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"here, for the purity of the soul , we do our best Your service!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin chuckled, "If I want to be an emperor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After waiting for half an hour, Du Lin was led by the priest into another cave. When the surrounding light suddenly lit up, he looked at everything here with a stunned look! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large group, about a hundred serious faces, dressed in a very elegant "noble" standing in a solemn palace, they are talking to each other, but when the light When Lu Lin stepped into the palace, the "nobles" who had exaggerated wigs and a solemn expression on his face turned to his waist and applied aristocratic etiquette, one by one. "Duo Lin is down." Two people who appeared to be acting as internal officials in the drama also ran over. They were lying on the ground about ten meters away from Doolin, and they climbed up with their hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They put Durin on the emperor’s clothes and put a scepter with the same scepter that the royal family used in the Imperial Museum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, the ministers have been waiting for a long time, please also step down to the throne." The inner officer bent over his ass and supported Du Lin. On the steps of the throne, every time he took a step, there would be some "nobles" who looked different from the nobility and bent down to salute him. It was not until he sat in the throne that he looked down at the nobles and ministers in the palace, and realized the terribleness of these people. Although he knows that all this is false, even though he knows that all people may be believers or even actors, when they use serious expressions and aristocratic tone to tell you about the good and bad things happening in the empire, As well as wrangling, it seems that he is really an emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Majesty..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"陛下..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"陛下..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very serious and emotional expression made Du Lin feel a tight heart. He realized that he just seemed to be working with this group of people to "act", he even Some questions that seem to exist in reality express their opinions. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, the southwestern part of the empire has been arid year after year, this year wheat has been owed, there has been a famine and the situation has become more and more serious, and the minister has asked his Majesty to transfer food from other places. To solve the famine." A minister took the initiative to stand up, and the expression of worrying about the country and the people was really like that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s mouth was slightly pumped. He suddenly said something that everyone could not expect. “Famine? Kill people without famine. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is simply a model of faint prince. The minister who appeared in the script did not think that the "Emperor" suddenly did not cooperate. He looked up awkwardly. After looking at Du Lin, he quickly succumbed to sin. Suddenly there was a nobleman who looked like a powdery face jumping out, using exaggerated body movements to match the somewhat funny tone, interspersed with the waist between Du Lin and many ministers and nobles, and said loudly, "Your Majesty has already made Decision-making, this matter is so decided. The news of famine before the end of the month is your fault."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Famine, because of food There are so many people who are limited but eaten, there will be famine, killing people almost, and there will be no famine. Although we killed some people, they also saved some people, whether they are alive or dead. The people will understand the painstaking efforts of their Majesty." He turned around and faced Du Lin, his face sullen and flattering. "The majesty is the most wise and decisive emperor in the millennium. I suddenly came up with such a good solution. The method is really amazing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin 嘚 嘚 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , May live, but will be big tonight Nobles killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you still satisfied? Has your obsession been eliminated? "When everything is over, the priest appears again in the empty palace. He still bows his head and stands under the ladder. "If you have anything you want to do, you can tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
