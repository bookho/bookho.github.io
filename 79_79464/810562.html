			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow is slowly falling, and there are fewer and fewer pedestrians on the street. Even the most lively Dawn Avenue has many shops that choose to close during the winter break. Occasionally, pedestrians are also in a hurry. This damn cold weather is really uncomfortable. Perhaps the greatest wish of these passers-by is to cover the roadside with blankets, drink hot coffee and read a favorite. Book? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of weather is really not suitable for work, the owner of the coffee shop is ready to temporarily suspend business, he is holding a wooden stick to the snow on the umbrella Knocked down and gathered all the umbrellas. If Mr. Doolin does not appear on time every morning, he will not open the door this morning. He felt that he might be a bit stupid. How could a character like Mr. Doolin on a snowy day come out with a snowstorm to have a cup of coffee and a burritos? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the stick in his hand and frowned while packing things up, and the death of the man was eventually "blamed" on him. The court held that he had to bear part of the responsibility for the death of the buddy. If it was not his long-term high-intensity abuse of the buddy's workforce, it would not cause the gang to be fired because it was too tired. To this end, the court sentenced him to give the family a family of eight hundred dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, don’t say 800 yuan, it’s 80 yuan, he’s not willing to give it, you can continue to fight the lawsuit and you can only continue to waste money. He can only recognize his nose. Perhaps it is because this lawsuit has made him famous. Until now, no one is willing to apply for it. Only the boss himself can do it first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just after he checked all the dangerous things and was about to close the door, a car slowly stopped at the side of the road, and the silver-white body was in the snow. In the middle of the game, it was even more dazzling. He manually moved the meal and immediately put the coffee pot back on the stove and turned on the switch. He hurried to the outside of the house, propped up a parasol, wiped the snow falling on the table, and the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin wore a thick trench coat and came down from the car with a hat and scarf. He glanced at the coffee house with the lights off and some apologized. Laughing, "Sorry, it hurts you to rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss waved again and again, repeated a few words "No", then returned to the kitchen and began to Mr. Doolin made burritos. As he did, he sighed, this is the real rich man, and the upstarts who don’t know how to show up with a little money are really different. Whenever and wherever, Mr. Doolin is a good-tempered person. It is also polite to people and never makes anything rude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's really hard to imagine that such a person is actually one of the richest young people in Irian's area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, this is what the rich people often say! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss quickly made the burritos, and with the coffee came to Mr. Doolin’s desk, Du Lin smiled and gave five dollars to give He, the boss was somewhat embarrassed to accept it. This is not the first time, and certainly not the last time. He is a little embarrassed every time. In his view, Mr. Doolin is able to keep sitting here for a while, drinking a cup of coffee, eating something, is actually an alternative propaganda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t have to pay, he should even provide coffee and food for free by the boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the newsboy appeared in the sight of Du Lin with the snow, he gasped, rubbed his hands, spread a roll of newspaper and placed it On the table. Du Lin slammed a dollar bill into the hat of the newsboy. The little guy ran and left after laughing and asking. Although it is snowing, the newspaper that can be sent still needs to be sent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the latest issue of the newspaper, which reported the latest news of the "century fraud case." I have to say that the press release in the hands of the George family is really very good at writing these news. It was only a fraud case involving a little "big" amount. The stunned prefix of the "century" was aroused the attention of the entire empire. . Even the news media on the federal side are tracking the story, which is said to have triggered and exposed some scandals there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clear disclosure of some information in the report, whether it is public opinion or from the top of the imperial government, they are somewhat impatient with the efficiency of the task force. It’s almost two months. I haven’t made any progress so far. I didn’t even find a penny. Some people are anxious. In the report, the task force seems to be maintaining and explaining, and it is actually stimulating the victims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin picked up the coffee and took a sip. He put down the newspaper and looked at the gray distant sky. Counting the time, they almost came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, this is more than 70 million fraud cases, always have to work hard, isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dulin thought, there has been no breakthrough progress so far, and there have been some anxiety and unsettled people inside the task force. No way, the people's congresses and public opinion gave them too much pressure. Those journalists who were pervasive did not know where they got their identity information, and they actually announced it. This has caused many members of the task force to be harassed and harassed by those victims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They called all day to inquire about the progress of the case, and some people were stunned. Some of the team members have already written the transfer report and are ready to leave here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, Amp knows that he is waiting for it, it may arouse even more trouble, and even let the high-level directly use Hodok as the case. The end of the case, the case was completely closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp, who has never failed, will not be willing to return without success. He and Clark discussed it and decided to go to Irian. The reason he used was that the important suspect, Juan, had suicide suicide. They wanted to investigate whether there was someone behind the suicide in Juan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper authorities who gradually lost patience immediately approved their opinions, but also gave them the final deadline. If there is no progress and clue in a month, this will stop here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dulin’s plan for the entire case, they plan to use Hoodock to block everyone’s mouth, as to when they can recover the stock market on the stock market. The money, that is another matter, first find someone to put this case over and say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were Amp and Clark, and the five members immediately dispatched, and in the snowy weather, they came to Irian by sea boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boat is slowly docked, the people who disembarked are not there except for them, and the people on board are more likely to go to the warmer places in the south to spend the winter, this is not theirs. destination. Amp and other entourage walked down the ramp here, and there was no pedestrian on the deserted street. The whole city was like asleep, and there was no bit of anger. The shops on both sides of the street are also closed. This is a common occurrence during the winter break, but it is too cold for the Anpu people who came here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember...Isn’t I said that Irian is one of the most prosperous cities on the East Coast?" Clarke took the heavy suitcase and walked the last one. Step by step, he looked at this city like no one living, a bit stunned. "I think even the West is more people than here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp laughs Laughing, wearing a hat, walking toward Dawn Avenue, while walking, said, "Because the temperature in winter is relatively large, and there are often snow, there is no tourists after winter. Tourism has lost as a local economic pillar industry. It is also normal for visitors to temporarily close as the core area of ​​the city. If you want to see people, go to the back area, there are still many people on the streets in the fourth and fifth districts."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know so much!" Clark complimented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp did not respond, when the group walked to Dawn Avenue, it was still Amp’s eye, and immediately saw the only small shop on the roadside that was open. Pointing to the other side, "Let's go get some hot stuff and warm up, go to the hotel. At this time, the hotel may not have prepared anything, there is still some time from noon." He raised his wrist to be used. The frozen red hand picked up the sleeves and revealed a watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still four hours to lunch, even if we are looking for a hotel now, I am afraid they have not prepared breakfast for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t really agree with Amp’s proposal. If you can drink a cup of hot coffee or hot milk in such a cold weather, and eat some new food, I am afraid it is the most. Enjoy the things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are new guests greeting, which makes the owner of the coffee shop have to open all the electrical, he went out to see, the face suddenly more A lot of smiles. Seven people, at least, can make him earn more than a dozen dollars, and it is so unexpected in such weather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people divided into two groups and asked for two tables. They were curious to look at Doolin, a stranger who came out in the snowy days, and Du Lin was also Look at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp’s eyes have been concentrated on Doolin’s face, and Doolin gave him a very strange feeling. He seems to have seen Doolin anywhere. There is no impression. When he noticed that Du Lin was also looking at him, he smiled and nodded, and Du Lin also nodded to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know?" Clark whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp shook his head slightly and looked at other places. "I don't know, it just feels a bit strange, his temperament is very unique."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark also took a look at Du Lin, and when they looked at each other, they nodded each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't think there was anything wrong with it, maybe he is richer. You know, rich people just like to blame!", say this sentence In the words, Clark did not forget to look at the luxury car parked by the road. Even a luxury car like the Imperial Capital could not be afforded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
