			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing a large paragraph of words, Henry raised his glass, with some teasing, with some calm, and some proud, he laughed, " This is also the responsibility that such a noble person in this position needs to bear, isn't it?" He took a sip and everyone was very supportive and drank the first drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene of the cold meal meeting is more like a casual salon. Everyone sits around a round table. The comfortable and comfortable sofa does not have too much British temperament. Instead, Leisure is everywhere. There are two long tables next to it, filled with fine food. The four senior chefs hired in Henry Manor still cook exquisite dishes for the guests in the kitchen. Of course, these things may not be appreciated until the end of the cold meal. One bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Henry, I think it makes a lot of sense in your words. I think a chaotic west is obviously a huge damage to our common interests, then How can we get the West back to a controllable calm?”, speaking to the agent of the Middle of the Middel Construction Group, whose name is George, but not the George of the George family. He is a relative More common "ordinary people." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no prominent birth background, nor has it become an in-law with some big men. He has a good degree and has finally climbed to this position after years of hard work. Standing in his current position and looking back, he felt that he took a seven-year Ph.D. in architecture to murder his most embarrassing life, because the seven years can not be said to be meaningless to his future, but also worth not tall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People live in this world, knowledge is only a weapon for people to fight in society, there are many kinds of weapons, but it is a pity that the most powerful weapons There is no weapon called knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle Construction Group is very large. Founder Mr. Middle is the designer of the palace, including many noble castles, manors, courtyards and other building facilities. They are all built by the Midel Construction Group, which makes the name of this construction group company very large in China. Many companies of all grades and scales hope that their future headquarters will be designed and constructed by the Midel Construction Group. Some rich people are even more Use this company to build a villa or manor for yourself to be touted by friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any capitalist will start thinking about two things after getting enough orders. The first thing is how to reduce his own cost. The second thing is how to To improve its profits, Midel Construction Group decided to establish a wholly-owned subsidiary in the west for the mining of various types of construction materials, including metal material. They have a large demand for gold, silver and steel, but the Western Mine will give them enough indicators every quarter to make them satisfied. This is also a company that will be hostile to the West Mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry reached out and pointed to Mr. George. "This is also the question we need to discuss and draw conclusions. Before discussing this issue, my butler just told me that the Imperial Army has begun to guard against illegal armed groups in the canyon. The Freedom Front launched an attack and sent it here in less than an hour. So, can we think that one of the reasons for the turmoil in the West has solved the problem of the Freedom Front?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around me thought about it for a moment and then nodded and agreed with Henry. Once the Freedom Front is finished, the almost stagnant ore and metal trade will start again. This is good news. And after this group of people is killed, there will be no other organization to do similar things in a short time. One of the problems of the turmoil in the west has been solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, then let’s talk about the issue that Mr. George just raised, how to get the West back to a controllable calm, but I am not very suitable for explaining this. The problem should be to explain this question to Mr. Doolin who knows more about these things." Henry glanced at Doolin, which they had discussed before, and couldn't let Henry sing a one-man show alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world’s people express their desires far beyond the world in Doolin’s dreams, and people believe that passionate emotions can infect more through the process of outward communication. Many people can more clearly reflect their own value, so even if Henry is willing, there will be others who oppose him to sing a one-man show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is sitting on the sofa. When he is sitting on the sofa, the armrests of the sofa are almost flush with his shoulders, but he has to say that this makes people look Going up to a sofa that is very "sit-like" does give people a particularly comfortable experience. He licked his lips. "I am very happy to see you here. Everyone here is an important part of Western business. Without any one, it is impossible to make the economic development of the western region flourish as it is today." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This also requires us to take on more social responsibilities. When I chat with Mr. Maggs, we often say a very special word, social responsibility. We are not vultures, not predators, we are responsible businessmen. There is a saying that I don’t know if you have heard of it, called 'get it from people’s hands and return it to people’s hands.'" People have exposed for the first time to hear such a summative summ of wisdom, shaking their heads, and looking at Du Lin with a very focused look, looking forward to his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who can become a spokesperson or executive director of a large region will never be an overly narrow person, because the narrow-minded people do not have such long-term vision and brave courage to support them to this step, the world will never exist. Fortunately, the so-called lucky ones are just the idols that some people package for some purpose, and they don't have any practical significance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like the lucky ones that the city of Otis can see almost every day. They don’t win a prize of 500,000 from the slot machine. The table was won 720 times, and the people who got rich overnight seemed to be concentrated in the city of Otis. But is that true? No, that's a fake. One of the ten people really wants to thank Du Lin for his honesty. As for the other people who are just actors in the casino, why do people have to pay an extra fee from other places or even abroad? , came to the city of Otis to play gambling games? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true of the people sitting here, they will not be lucky to have the status of today. They can sit here and talk to everyone, and they will make a future from the family like the abyss by killing a bloody way from a workplace like hell. They will not negate everything because they may not understand or dislike themselves. They will consider a lot of factors and finally use their own reason to decide their final choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The meaning of this sentence is actually very simple, I continue to condense the content of this sentence with a word, that is, loop, or reincarnation. We are from Ordinary people earn profits in their lives. These profits should eventually be used to give back to the society. This is also the first step in social responsibility. An orderly market economy will bring more long-term stability to a region, and sustainable and rapid. Development."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But in the West, in addition to the Freedom Front, which is no longer a problem, there are still two problems."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first is the Western Mining Association, the full name is the Western Mining Development Committee. The existence of the Western Mining Association is a commercial retrogression. I believe that everyone here is a successful businessman. Then we should also understand that a good market needs at least one condition, that is, an orderly competition elimination mechanism. Only under such a mechanism will the market be prosperous. However, the existence of the West Mine will not only hinder the order. Competition Moreover, because of their arrogance, they attempted to control the ore market of the entire empire, causing chaos in the west."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that the West Mine has been released The guidance price in the second quarter of this year, but some of the transaction price in online foreign transactions is much lower than the guidance price, and some are higher than the guidance price. This has a terrible consequence, many people are losing money and making money. It’s only a small part. In order to avoid the break of the capital chain, this loss-minded mine owner will join the out-of-line transaction to make the market very unstable at a more chaotic price.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
