			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Soro only proposes things like money as a bargaining chip, the Governor’s Lord will never agree, and the money is enough for him. Just do it, as long as you have the power in your hand, you can get it when you want money. However, Solo touched him in the second half of the sentence. He didn't know where Solo got the news, but he was really moved. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new party’s organizational structure is somewhat special. It refers to the aristocratic prime minister’s system at the time, and draws on the federal parliamentary system, which combines a new political organizational structure. From the first person in the cabinet, Magus goes down, does not set up a deputy leader or a position called a second leader. The second party in the party is the chairman of the New Party Committee. The role of the New Party Committee is quite extensive, and the New Party Committee can be regarded as the core institution of the New Party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This institution is fully responsible for the election of the New Party, the appointment and dismissal of the positions of the party within the New Party, and responsibility for all matters within and outside the party, is a party A comprehensive body with great powers, and the main person in charge is the chairman of the committee and the vice-chairmen of the two committees. The three will fully preside over the work within the party and have a very heavy authority. The goal of the governor of this time is a vice chairman of the committee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as he can get on this position, entering the top ten in the party is basically not a problem. He is forty-seven years old this year, and there is still a long time to let him go down, enough to kill some of his opponents in his position. He will have two paths to go in the future. First, he will become the chairman of the committee. His position in the party is second only to the leader of the new party, or he can directly enter the political arena. From the ministerial level, he has the opportunity to win the highest throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has planned a route for his political career in the latter half of his life, and now he only needs to step forward step by step. Of course, in this process, he needs someone to help him overcome some difficulties and knock open some closed doors. Soro’s speech touched his most sensitive nerves very well. He indulged for a moment, and when he was just about to put out the plan between Magus and him, suddenly there was a shadow that blocked the light. He was timely. Closed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a young man who first presented his work permit, a document from a senior detective of the Anti-Organization Crime Investigation Bureau, and then whispered The governor said the situation they found. Regardless of whether the goal of Bangka is the governor or not, the security of the governor is not to be lost. This time they not only dispatched agents from their own bureau, but also dispatched a part of the agents from the police investigation bureau to ensure that the governor would not There are any accidents here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the young agent regained his position with a sly smile, the governor turned his face and looked at him with amazement. After a while, he shook his head and his lips moved and did not say anything. He took a sigh of relief and looked at Solo, who was also a bit stunned. He said softly: "Our things are just like this. I will call you back. Now I have to leave some things, thank you very much for your hospitality! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up his hat and briefcase and stood up and shook hands with Solo, nodded and quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo is a bit confused, he doesn’t know what the young detective and governor said, let the governor leave immediately, but it should be very important. Official business? He looked at Ornes with his head tilted, and Ernes bent down slightly. "We should have no problem with our affairs, right?" He was not very sure, and he needed Orne to confirm his guess. And Ernes’s reply also gave him a sigh of relief. This thing was made, and he took a big step away from his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are some twists and turns, the result is always good, which makes him feel a lot better. It is very important and very important to tell him that the Governor’s intention to run for the post of Vice-Chairman of the New Party Committee is the old party member. The facts are now in front of you, but fortunately, the owed people do not need him for the time being, then they have to wait for him to become the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then we...", Solo looked at a dining car that was coming towards them in the distance, shrugged his shoulders and pointed easily across the street. The position where the Governor of the Governor has just sat, "Let's enjoy a big meal, then go back to the North!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A table full of dishes makes Solo eat very much Comfortable, he likes the dishes of the South, and the taste changes and visual changes are more. At the same time, the rare ingredients in the north are also very much here. In short, he is very satisfied. To this end, the table used him three hundred pieces. This money is not a problem for a successful business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making Eunes pay the money and paying the extra tip, the two slowly walked out of the Starlight Restaurant and they parked on the side of the road. In the car, suddenly four young people rushed out of the car a dozen meters away, and rushed to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo was shocked to see the pistol held in the other hand, holding Ornes turned and squatting in the car, he did not want to save Europe Nes, purely hope that Ornes is not a strong body can resist a few bullets for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the guns did not sound. The moment the already deployed agents rushed out of the car under the Bangka, they also started the arrest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were dozens of black holes pointing at the muzzle, the young people did not blindly die, they threw the pistol on the ground as requested by the detective. Then slowly squat down, hold your hands, let the body lean forward, and finally kneel on the ground, and take the initiative to lift your hands high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agents immediately swarmed and grabbed the four young people and found the target they wanted to assassinate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two gentlemen, I am a senior agent of the Woodland Anti-Organization Crime Investigation Bureau. You have seen it, so I hope that you can cooperate with it... ...", he put away the pistol in his hand, and said with a smile: "This is not a joke!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unsettled Solo looked up and was caught The young people who lived, he stood up in blush, and at that moment he felt that he was dying, and the intense heartbeat made him very uncomfortable. At this time, he did not slow down, but he gasped and looked at the agent who was against the investigation bureau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, Ernes has already returned, and he took the initiative to stand up in front of Soro and looked directly at the agent and said: We can cooperate with your investigation, but we can wait until our lawyers come!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem!", Douglas reached out and invited, with two The person went to the car of the Anti-Organization Crime Investigation Bureau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, at the moment Solo and Ornes had just been sent to the Anti-Organization Crime Investigation Bureau, their personal information was also checked, the Bureau of Investigation The director looked at the personal information of the two men and suddenly felt a little pain in the skull. Although the singer consortium is in the north, the influence of this consortium is very large, and it is not the kind of "positive" influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the truths known to some of his personal channels, a significant portion of the source of wealth of the hymn consortium is largely derived from illegal smuggling. Yes, this financially powerful, prestigious and prestigious consortium is also operating a smuggling business that is profitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why no one has investigated the sacred consortium so far, is that because the sacred consortium is strong, there are too many branches and leaves, and the relationship is complicated. It is difficult to achieve the goal without a comprehensive plan. Secondly, the Shengge consortium has a large number of factories. These factories have 200,000 jobs in the north. Once there are some accidents, it is very likely to cause turmoil in the northern society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
