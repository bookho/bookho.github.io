			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car washer licked the hoe, and as he moved, he felt his head blew! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He vaguely remembered his own experience before the coma, when he dressed everything, ready to go to work, at the moment of opening the door, was knocked on by two teenagers On the head, hit somewhere on his ear. Next, there is endless darkness, time seems to be shortened, and when he blinks again, he is already here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a room with broken tiles on the walls. The temperature is a bit low, which makes him feel cold. The clothes on the body were all lighted, and the whole person was tied to a table. He struggled hard, and the person responsible for the bundling must be very diligent, and the ropes on the limbs did not shake. He screamed and screamed, and no one came for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s because of waking, he feels getting colder and colder, the body’s hair is erected, and the body is shaking slightly because of the cold. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, who is teasing me? My boss is Mad Dog Weisen, you will pay for your actions!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I am wrong, I have realized my own stupidity, beg you, give me a little dress, or give me a quilt!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what he said, shouting, crying or roaring, no one To bother the loneliness of this room. Just when the car washer was almost completely desperate and thought that he might be frozen here, he heard the sound of metal rubbing, the sound of opening the door, and several different footsteps. At this moment, he had a lot of spirits. He licked his cracked lips. He groaned and suffocated. "Damn, come and save me, let me do anything, but don't shut me alone. Is it ok?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned his head and looked in the direction of the sound, and several young people in rubber jumpsuits came in. This rubber bodysuit is mostly loved by butchers. Whether it is blood or various organ fluids sprayed when the animal's internal organs are cut, it only needs a basin of water to wash it clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a total of five young people in front and back. The guy who led the team was a little thick. He went to the table and looked at the car washer who could not do it. He asked: "Your mother is a Guar, is "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone said that at the critical moment, people can explode unimaginable power. In fact, there is still a situation when this happens, that is, people The ability to think will be improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car washer realized that these people are all Guartes, he nodded hard and tried to make himself look as honest and reliable as possible. "Yes, you are right, my mother is a Guar, and I am a Guar. Hey, man, we are all ourselves, can you give me a dress?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy asked again: "Your mother did not tell you, in the Guar, how would you sell your own?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car washer is a bit stunned, and it will take a while to come back. "I have not sold anyone. I swear, I am just a car washer. I am a small person, even if I want to sell." I also need to be qualified to know the big guys first!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's right!", the teenager nodded and took two steps. "You should listen to your mother's words in peacetime. In the tradition of Guart, the betrayers must accept the punishment of the gods. Since you admit that you are a Guart, You must also bear the punishment that you need to accept as a Guar, let the gods and the first king judge whether you are guilty or not guilty!", he said that he retreated to the wall and stopped talking, and the other four were Surrounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them stuffed a large piece of cloth into the mouth of the car washer, and a salty moment spread through his mouth, not only that I also felt a stinking smell, but why is this taste so familiar? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, before his brain summoned important information to the body, a fierce painful Europe tore his inner defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are peeling his skin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, you stop... please, are you mistaken?" The car washer mourned while cursing, but the teenagers were like It was not heard at all. The silver knife in their hands is particularly sharp. He can see his skin separated from the fat membrane a little bit. The strange thing is that there is not a lot of blood flowing out. He prayed that he could live, but at the same time prayed that he would return to the embrace of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the endless fear, he fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he woke up again, he was already hanging in the park not far from where he lived - on the bronze statue of a general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than an hour, the sky is getting brighter and the morning exercisers are coming out of the house. This park is obviously a place for morning exercises. When the first scream pierced the tranquility of the park, the police quickly arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the red monster that was stripped of the skin and couldn’t tell the difference, Prando’s blue veins. He turned around just a few times, too disgusting, disgustingly let his old policeman have a desire to vomit. He recruited and asked two young policemen who were extremely ugly to come over. "Go and put the guy down, then go to the hospital to rescue. If he survives, ask him if he remembers who did it." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If...has not been rescued?", a young police officer could not help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the gap in experience, and of course it can be seen as an accumulation of experience. Prando rolled his eyes. "If the rescue doesn't come back, are you going to bring a body back to the police station? The idiots are of course thrown at the hospital. They will turn him into a popsicle and burn it!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After commanding Prando, he left the scene and got into his car. After sitting silent for a while, the commander driver, "Go to the Star of the East, where damn On Queen's Road!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, this is Doolin's handwriting. No one used this criminal law to treat the Guart before he rose. Only after he rose, this damn criminal law reappeared in the city. No matter who this guy is betrayed, it must have something to do with Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a word, Prando didn’t want to manage these troubles because he knew that even if he knew that this was Doolin’s work, he could not Du Lin grabbed it and put it in jail. There are many people in the fellowship and his Oriental Star, even on the streets, who are willing to sin for him. In the group of Guartes in the city of Tener, Du Lin’s reputation is fast at an unimaginable speed. Hey, more authoritative than Heidler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People trust him, he also gives back to the rewards of the Guar people’s trust, he makes many families no longer suffer from poverty, so many people With clothes to wear, have a meal, let them have a decent life. Perhaps their decent face is nothing but a disease for the poor gentlemen of the city, but he did it, he changed, and people trust him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police car soon stopped outside the door of the Eastern Star. Du Lin, who was standing on the second floor, looked at Prando from the police car. He shrugged his shoulders and said to the Buddha, the trouble came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the trouble is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando slammed his face and sat in the chair opposite Du Lin, separated by a table, like a partition A world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You shouldn’t be so arrogant, at least at this time, you shouldn’t be so arrogant!" Prando complained as soon as he spoke. "Last and Last time I tried to get you down, but you are constantly making troubles. One day, I can't help you any more. You have to understand that although I am the director of the regional police station, I still can't do it. There are so many things in your imagination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a box of cigarettes from the drawer and lost a piece of the past. A lighter came to Prando's side. Prando looked at the Buddha and looked at Du Lin for a while before he ordered cigarettes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to me, if you still want to play lynching, go to the suburbs to play, there will be no one to control you, but the city can't, I don't want to take things Big trouble.", spit a smog, Prando originally wanted to use more harsh rhetoric to swear Du Lin, but inexplicable he subconsciously chose a relatively moderate rhetoric. He didn't understand what it was because he felt he should do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando actually said nothing wrong, he couldn’t possibly cover all such horrible lynchings, and he also believed that the big guys must know These things. Once or twice, those big people can still hold their breath, but the number is too many, and certainly someone has to have opinions. But at the same time, he and Du Lin are very clear. Now Du Lin is a member of the old party. At the same time, he has just left a deep impression on the members and the mayor. Even if it is a little too hot, the big people in this "honeymoon period" are also He will not care about him, provided that he does his own essential work – giving enough money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. "I know, I will pay attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This The next son, Prando, was even more surprised. When did the little demon of Doolin speak so well? He didn't know what Dulin was doing, so he chose silence in the face of Doolin's answer, because if he didn't speak, he would at least not be brought into the trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
