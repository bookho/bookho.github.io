			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin actually brought a lot of bits and pieces, like some small ornaments, such as the buttons of gems, this kind of thing is very Common. Although every tailor has his own maximum credibility to ensure that the clothes he sews will not cause any problems, but sometimes there will be some small flaws, for example, when attending the event, suddenly found that there are fewer buttons on his clothes. What should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most nobles have a mental illness that cannot be described, and they are very ill. They will not consider what a sir or a woman with identity can do in a place that no one else can see. It does not pay much attention to the private life of these people, including social issues such as moral conditions. Under the premise of their own interests, they have an indifferent attitude towards the lives of others. But there is another situation, even if there is no interest in the dispute, they will be very concerned, very concerned, that is whether the gentleman or the lady is doing something that is detrimental to their own decent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inexplicable mentality of seeing other people’s jokes has caused countless times of war between nobles in history, perhaps just because someone has a button on their clothes. Or someone has some dust on the upper. Then they started to laugh and were happy to share their findings - hey, that guy's clothes are actually missing a button, it's so ridiculous, to know that he is a nobleman, actually like the mud dog legs do not pay attention to their instruments ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of neuropathies! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in order to avoid these problems to the utmost extent, the nobles usually put one or two in the pockets of clothes worn in formal social occasions, or in the bag. A gemstone buckle, these gemstone buckles can play a big role when necessary, and Doolin's pocket also has such a button, or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sending the princess jewels...it doesn't seem very good, he touched his pocket and found a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the princess is not a princess but a prince, a cigarette may be a good gift, Du Lin will also say that he wants to give the emperor the first life in life. Fire, but it was a girl, a princess, and he was too rude to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, in wallets, coins, gemstones, cigarettes and lighters, Doolin chose a lighter. It is a hand-made sapphire mirror sounding lighter, the market price ... wrong, this thing has no market price, is completely customized products, spent 12,300 Du Lin, although expensive, available but very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He checked the lighter again, stood in the corner and wiped it with a napkin, then placed it in his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the birthday party is going to the gift-giving session, the guests start to present gifts from big to small depending on the title. Magus is certainly not the first to be ranked, he gave the princess is a very beautiful handmade swan feather pen. A full-length white swan feather is lying in a red flannel box. The red flannel is more white, and the golden nib and the tiny signature on the pen are the origin of this swan feather pen. Made the best remarks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a master hand-made product, the price is about 100, the practicality is not good, as a gift is very qualified, and it The original role is to give gifts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sending you this pen...", Magus put the gift box in the hands of the princess, "I hope that the Royal Highness Princess can be in the ocean of knowledge." Find the true self and discover all the secrets of exploring the world. Knowledge is the ladder of human progress and makes people more perfect, which is what I expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The Princess of the Royal Highness pretends to be a very pleasant surprise. She took the gift box from Magus and looked very moved. "His Prime Minister, thank you very much for your gift. I like it very much and I will definitely be strong." Remember your advice,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very touching picture, but Dooling doesn't feel moved, if someone sends him on his most important day The pen told him to study hard, he must not laugh so happy, it is fake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for more than thirty or forty people to give a gift, Magus gently touched Du Lin with his elbow and whispered, " It’s your turn.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I? Am I not the last one?”, Du Lin’s sentence just said that he saw Maggie’s expression and knew himself. Say a stupid thing, he does not wait for what Maggs said, headed down to the Princess of the Princess. He is the man brought by Magus, and is also the youngest person in the aristocratic circle. He is not comparable to the real big aristocrats in front, almost all of the Earl of Marquis, but compared to the Viscount or the Baron. Still have to be stronger. Whether it is to give Magus face, or the opportunity he has won, in short, he ranks between the count and the viscount to present his own gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked under the princess's temple, and a scent of milk came out. He had a moment of embarrassment, then took out his own lighter from his pocket and handed it over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a quiet in the palace, even the Princess’s Highness had some inexplicable look at the lighter in Du Lin’s hand, and it took only a minute or two to pause. . Some nobles around have begun to whisper, they don't care who you are, the unscrupulous performance of those who look at similar jokes, and more like a tradition. Perhaps the root cause of the first ridicule of other nobles to derogate many years ago was for political service, but to this day, the aristocratic ridicule of the nobility has become a tradition of nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus is looking forward to Doolin’s next performance. He knows that Doolin brought a book in and saw Du Lin sneaking the book into the trash. Inside the bucket, he wanted to see how Du Lin reversed the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is... lighter?", the princess of the princess used a less certain tone to evaluate the delicate little things in her hands, and some nobles even laughed out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was very calm, and there was no sway in his eyes. He nodded slightly and smiled. "Yes, this is a lighter..." His voice gradually became louder, and he turned his eyes to those nobles who were laughing at him. He also raised his eyebrows and revealed a subtle and provocative expression. "But it is not a lighter!" Du Lin reached out. From the hand of the princess, the lighter was taken back, and a softly populated hatch cover, the slamming sound has a special charm spread long, slowly disappearing in people's ears, those who are laughing at him, are whispering Also closed his mouth and looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s thumb moved, a flame appeared on the lighter, and he chuckled and turned to look at the Princess’s Highness. “This is the flame, the Royal Highness, It is a lighter, but it is not entirely a lighter. I believe that you and all the ladies and gentlemen here have a wealth of knowledge, knowing that human development begins with the first man-made flame, and the flame is lit. The long, awkward civilization of mankind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sending you a lighter, I hope that you can have your own dawn after you reach adulthood and light yourself. The future of life guides the right direction for the maze of life full of temptation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can laugh out loud around Du Lin’s words. Although it was just a lighter, as Dulin said, it was not exactly a lighter. Magus smiled and shook his head. The darling, expressiveness and appeal of this little bastard was really terrible. He was the most powerful. The place is his confidence. He is confident that he can solve all these problems, and he must also spread this confidence to others. Perhaps this is why he always succeeds because he makes everyone believe in what he believes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
