			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin suddenly stunned when faced with Mr. Xerma’s question. He remembered that Merlin had said it last year, saying that Suri was pregnant, how Are you pregnant now? This made Du Lin a bit strange. He stood up and walked back to the house. If it wasn't for his sister's reminder, he couldn't even find the phone somewhere - the phone was actually placed on the table in the living room, but Mrs. Covered with a handkerchief on the phone, the phone is completely covered, saying that if it does, the dust will not fall on the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called the phone and dialed Merlin’s phone after dialing the wrong number. Merlin answered the call and was a little breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is Merlin..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, Doolin.", Du Linwei A younger brother and sister standing in the corner and preparing to eavesdrop on his phone, a group of little guys ran away, and he sat back in the chair outside the living room. "I remember that Surrey was pregnant last year, but his father. But told the New Year that when you came back, you said that Duri was pregnant. Can I find out what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the phone fell into silence. For a long time, Mei Lin said, "Suri aborted, and later became pregnant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin couldn’t help but squeeze the bridge with the empty hand, just How long did it take to get pregnant? Is this murder? Of course, he can understand that Merlin doesn't know much about these things, but can Su Rui not understand it? What must have happened between them. If Merlin is not his own brother, if not Mr. Kemma asks about this, Du Lin doesn't even want to go to it. Merlin is an adult. He has his own ideas. He is also responsible for his actions. There is no need. Let him interfere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the problem is that Mr. Kemma has asked him now, and he knows some things, always have to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just heard the voice of a woman, is it Su Rui?", when Merlin spoke, a female voice asked a "what", although the sound Very small but Du Lin still heard. I would like to thank the great telegraph office for its outstanding contribution to the question of telephone sound fidelity. Otherwise, he really can't tell whether the voice is a man or a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin made a ban on a girl with his head tilted. He has a headache now, and he is a little afraid of Doolin. In addition to what Du Lin did to make him feel unfamiliar, Merlin, who gradually began to integrate into society, realized that he wanted to have a perfect life and could not do without Du Lin's support. If Du Lin didn't give him a sum of money every month for him to use, he would never be able to live such a happy life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Rui’s abortion is actually directly related to his “derailment”. At that time, Su Rui had been pregnant for about four months, and began to show up with some symptoms common to pregnant women during pregnancy, so she had been resting at home. Go out. Once Merlin went out to buy a car..., the salesman found Merlin's wealth. At first, Merlin resisted such things and refused to leave contact. But in an accident, he met the girl again. The girl's enthusiasm made Merlin difficult to refuse, and he left the contact information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of times the story happens naturally. It’s not a difficult thing for a sweet-looking girl to pursue a man from the country. Of course, this man has to With money, soon Merlin and the salesman discussed how to stick to the abdominal muscles. His frequent outings and late returning Su Rui had doubts. The woman during pregnancy always became very sensitive, so she quietly followed Merlin and finally broke the incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a skirmish between the three, and Suri was pushed aside, fell to the ground and aborted. Afterwards, Merlin apologized to Su Rui, and Su Rui also forgave Merlin, which reminded Merlin of Du Lin’s warning to him that Su Rui is the best girl for him. Although Suri is very material, she wants to guarantee her status. And enjoy, she can tolerate all the misconduct of Merlin. As long as she doesn't break through her bottom line, even if she knows that Merlin is fooling outside, she will pretend to know nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They reconciled, and after three months, Suri was pregnant again. Of course, Du Lin wrongly blamed Merlin, that is, Suri's pregnancy is not Merlin's fault, but Su Rui urgently wants to set the relationship, use pregnancy as a means to marry Merlin and get everything he wants. It is acceptable to bear a little risk for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl lying next to Merlin at this time is not Su Rui, not even the last salesman, another girl. Merlin has a capital that is proud of him. He is very handsome and very rich. Merlin, who has been integrated into the modern society, knows how to dress himself. This makes many girls willing to circle around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s another girl, not Su Rui." Finally, Merlin decided to tell the truth. "You know, I don't know how to refuse." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe you a ghost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was laughed at by Merlin’s words. "If you are not my brother, I will not care if you are dead or alive. Listen, in Su Ruisheng. Before you go to the child, give me a little honest, and then get married as soon as possible. After the child is born, I will find some things for you. As for what you want to do in the future, but now you must listen to me, understand Have you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Du Lin said, if it is not a relative, who will control who is dead or alive? And Merlin also knew that Du Lin was good for him. He immediately agreed and promised to get married at the latest in August. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin’s business is over, Du Lin shook his head after hanging up the phone. Compared to Mason, Merlin is just a jerk. He was just preparing to go out and Mr. Xerma had to return the question, but he saw his sister standing at the door of the living room. "Is there something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin My sister is Kinsale, two years older than Doolin. She and Merlin are twins. Kinsale's plaid is very high, which inherits the pedigree of the Kesma family. Now it is one meter and seventy-five, which is a little shorter than Du Lin. She looks pretty good, at least in Du Lin's view, a black hair set off her excellent skin, but also a mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kinsale nodded, "I want to be a star!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said Rubbing your eyes, "Sorry, I didn't hear clearly, what did you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to be a star!", Kinsale went to Doolin to find I sat down on a chair. "I want to be a star. Do you understand? Star, Mime, West, Star."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I Can you ask why?" Du Lin felt for the first time that none of his brothers and sisters was worrying. Mason was happy at the police station. Merlin became a scum man, and now his sister is again. To be a star, of course Du Lin ignored the things he did. "Why do you have this idea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, because it...", Kinsell raised his chin, and Du Lin saw a square with a tablecloth. He walked over and smashed the tablecloth, revealing a TV set. "Yes, I saw you send it back. Those tapes, I think the performance is very interesting, and I also think that the women inside do not look good. Since they can all be stars, why can't I be a star?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Good, very suitable reason, Du Lin licked his temple, "When the star is very bitter, and it is also very troublesome..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Have you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Even if I know people, you need rigorous training, and no one has a chance to perform...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is there you?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you have me, I can't let you become a star casually, you have to know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Is there not you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doolin explained that there was still no use for half a day, Kinsale said that he must become a star, no one can stop it. Her star dream, even if Du Lin does not support her, she has to go out to squat, Du Lin knows that he said so many words are nonsense, it is meaningless. He walked out of the house with a little bit of pain, sitting in the chair next to Mr. Kesma, and Mr. Kemma gave him a squint and smiled twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know how troublesome a father is? You need to look after every child, avoid them going the wrong way, and worry about what they are suffering from. The temptation of things deviates from the right path. To be honest, if you are not my children, I have already killed you all, but who makes you all my children?", these words of Mr. Kesma seem to be Pointing to it, he pointed to Alisa, who was playing with Mr. Knoxma, and asked, "How are you going to treat this woman? Hey?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the real feelings of Alisa, shook her head slightly. "She can't, she can't do my wife, not that I raise myself to belittle others. I have to find one that can be at the key." Always pick up the wife of my career, otherwise I would rather not get married."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? It’s still not a thing as before!", Kesma The gentleman smiled and shook his head. "Get away from me. I don't want to hear you again before I have dinner." The sound of the bastard, roll!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"好嘞......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day at noon At dinner, Du Lin returned to Turner with Dudu. They also had to do a steam locomotive back to Orodo in the afternoon, but Alisa did not go back. Du Lin talked with her. She decided to stay in Ziwei Town, stay with her children, and raise two children to grow up. Moreover, she has no place to go. Since Mr. Xiaoxma was stolen, her interpersonal relationship has completely collapsed. All her friends regard her as a plague, and no one wants to continue to be friends with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
