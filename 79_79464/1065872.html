			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news of Doolin’s return soon spread on the street where the Guar people lived, and with Doolin’s large-scale “Jiangshan” outside, The living standards of the Guar people are getting higher and higher, especially the Guars on the side of the Teier, and the benefits they enjoy are also the best. When Doolin started his family, the Guarts gave him a lot of help. Even some teenagers died for him in the hardest time. Du Lin could not forget these people, and all the people who are still alive here. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it hasn’t returned for more than a year, Du Lin’s appearance on this street is immediately like a holiday. People have lit up all the things that can be lit up in the house. People have come out from home and greeted Du Lin with enthusiasm. They loved Doolin, just like the guars who supported their princes more than a thousand years ago. People stood on both sides of the road in a very orderly manner. Du Lin was half-pushing and half-walking, while walking with people. Greeting, like a king who is reviewing his own people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin, Doolin, look here...", a seventeen-year-old girl screamed, the voice overshadowed the surrounding voice, Doolin I couldn't help but look at the past. When the eyes of the two met in the air, the girl’s screams stopped abruptly, and the happy hands held their hands on the chest. After a moment, Du Lin’s gaze moved away, and she screamed again. “Hey, he just saw me, he likes me...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This little episode, Du Lin's mood gradually changed and calmed down. Even the extraordinarily noisy around can not interfere with his inner world at this time. Calm is like a well-changing well in a row, without a trace of waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People like him, love him, he has been fighting for this goal, everything he does is worthy of people like him. He brought change, changed the future, and filled the future with light. At this moment, he felt that there was a beam of light that pierced the curtain of the night, and that was what he struggled for. He will certainly move forward toward the great goal of national rejuvenation, and he will not regret it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This street is not long, only four hundred meters, Du Lin walking is not slow, it took more than ten minutes to come to an end. At the end of the road stood a group of people, but this group of people is not the same as the group in front! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are a little older, they look at Doolin’s eyes are not the same as others, Du Lin walks over and kisses their foreheads . Their children died in the past battles for Doolin, perhaps they had resentful when they just received the news, and they felt that their children were stupid, and they had to die outside for an irrelevant person. . But soon they were relieved because their children did not die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their children just changed the form of existence, always guarding them, guarding Du Lin, and guarding all the Guartes. They should not be sad, they should not cry, they should feel glory, because their children will become an indelible part of the revival of the Guarts, and will always be accompanied by legends and history, and will last forever! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there anything I need to do?" Du Lin stood in front of these mothers and whispered, "Although I said it, I told them, Committed to all Guarts, you are my mother, your children are my brothers and sisters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old woman takes Du Lin The hand put Du Lin's hand in his palm, Du Lin can feel the frustration of the old woman's hand in every wrinkle, and can feel the terrible heat of this old hand palm owner! The old woman looked up at Du Lin, her eyes were a little muddy, but she couldn’t stop an indescribable, a kind of spiritual power bursting out of her muddy eyes, making her eyes look extra bright. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are doing very well, child, we are always watching you, watching you dangle the dignity we scattered on the ground, see you Pulling us out of the abyss, no one can do better than you do, child. You are our pride, the pride of all gualts, the pride of the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman’s words resonated. They didn’t know much about what Du Lin was doing outside, and often only learned through a few people’s mouths what Du Lin did. What achievements have been made. With the construction of the Guar's Cathedral in Tener from the construction to completion, the city of Tener has a different feeling in the minds of the Guar people. It is more like the heart of the Guarts. Harbor. It’s not just that there is a piece of money that everyone has built together, the entire empire and even the world’s largest and most luxurious church, but it has become the first place to blow the horn of the nation’s rise. It is like a holy place, and every day it welcomes pilates from all over the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrival of these people also brought Doolin’s news and brought him what he was doing outside, and people knew what Du Lin looked like. Not as easy to maintain as people think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should not bear so many responsibilities at this age, but these responsibilities are his mission, this is what he should do, the gods delivered to him. task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took the old woman's hand and smiled and didn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Du Lin and his team took the steam locomotive to Ilyan. Jupiter is lucky enough to follow Du Lin, which makes Giuseppe both. There are some flaws for this. The president of the club looks very great. It is already the best in the guar of a certain area, but it is still not as good as those who follow Du Lin. Whether it is Dufo or Ellis or other small partners, although they are only a captain, although they do not have such a louder title as the president, but in the perception of the entire Guar, their status is better than the club The length is much higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like in the ancient kings, even if the head of the army had a great prestige, it was far less respected and recognized by the heroes of the first king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jupiter can have such an opportunity, and Giusset is happy for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to be so popular." Jinsell remembered that when Du Lin left Turner in the morning, there were thousands of people to send him. Can't help but sigh. My own brother has become so great unconsciously, and as a sister, there is actually a lot of pressure. She cheered herself in her heart, and she must become a big star, otherwise she would lose Du Lin’s face. Of course, she was also curious as to why Du Lin was able to gain the recognition of so many people. At home, Du Lin was not so powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Du Lin was a very obedient, not too many followers. Mason, Merlin and Kinsale are two or three years older than Doolin, and Du Lin is the smallest in their group. As for the younger brothers and sisters, they are a few years younger than Doolin. They belong to the second ladder. Doolin does not play with them. He follows the ass of their three people every day. At that time, I couldn't see that Du Lin could have such a remarkable achievement. Kinsale also often bullied Du Lin, for example, grabbing his things to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you talk to me, how did you do this?" Kinsale left the country where he lived for more than 20 years, the whole person They are all floating, and they are full of curiosity about everything outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at her, made a ban, and closed her eyes. Kinsale squinted his eyes and looked at the Buddha sitting behind him. "All Buddha, you said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddhas opened their eyes I thought, "I think Du Lin is right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
