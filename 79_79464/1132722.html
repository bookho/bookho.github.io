			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glared at Ophelia, her head resting on her shoulder, greedily sniffing the smell of her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a taste that can’t be said, sweet, sweet, can make people feel happy, and it can make people calm, as if Everything that happens outside will not let you care again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot air that spits out when breathing blows her hair and irritates her skin. She laughs like a little girl who is ticklish. Leaning his neck to the side, he pushed Doolin hard, but did not push him away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Doolin with a bit of a strange look, just as Du Lin was looking at her, and their eyes met in a very short distance. Blend together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure eyes made Du Lin feel the peace that she had never seen before, but Ophelia saw a heartache in Doolin’s eyes. lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her attention left on TV, looked at Doolin’s eyes, then extended her hands and hugged her, holding his head in his arms, it seems Only in this way can you warm the cold world in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t know if it’s useful, but she needs to try it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, no one has ever seen Du Lin, and it is even more impossible to experience the deepest feelings in his heart. He always shows so confident and powerful. There seems to be nothing to stop him. Even Magus believes that Doolin was born in this world is the biggest mistake, because he is too smart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In history, in the myths and legends, those boundless lives to come to this world are always subject to many hardships and bumps, even early deaths. Only in a flash can they shine the light they once existed and the changes they bring to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin has nothing to pay, he is healthier than anyone, he is almost perfect... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But who can understand the true loneliness in his heart? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Mason and Merlin, Doolin just passed out for an afternoon, but for Du Lin, the dream has been going on for decades, and he can now clearly recall some of the details of his dreams. Every character includes every sentence they have said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exfoliating the hard shell, he is always an ordinary person, as well as the emotions of ordinary people, even fear. He just hides his heart very tightly, makes people look down, can't see through, but it doesn't mean he doesn't! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond all the knowledge and experience, in addition to bringing him unparalleled experience and the current glory, sometimes he will feel lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lonely will not always entangle him, only at a certain moment, suddenly burst, the deadly air silence will make the whole world gray ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Du Lin began to struggle, Ophelia let out his arm and looked at him, and there was no more in his eyes. He sucked his nose a few times and suddenly said, "I am going to be killed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Du Lin Taking Ophelia together on the sofa to watch TV, discussing the next story, suddenly the dull life let Du Lin get a relaxation that has never been seen before, he cherishes the present life, and the side around him people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time always slips away from your side inadvertently, waiting for you to discover that it is already outside the light years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophelia has to go to school, this is an indispensable process in her life, and Du Lin will not be selfishly holding her around. This is her power to enjoy life, no one can stop it, and then, he will return to the West to start building for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week ago, Doolin also thought that the title of his governor was proper, but after talking to Magus once, his consciousness is now uncertain. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old party is going to take the stage. Before going to power, there will definitely be a core meeting inside, in order to avoid similar "fraud" in the next general election, most A direct and powerful way is to inspire more cities and states to fall to the old party camp. Du Lin said that there was something about Vivienne. Magus also agreed to it. Maybe even if he didn't say it, Mrs. Vivian could be elected. After all, she was also an old party! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
