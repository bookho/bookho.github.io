			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott was a little surprised when he came to see Du Lin. He did not think that Du Lin would be so rich and become one of the bidders in the eighth district. . Bidding is actually just a foreign statement. After the planning of the eighth district, basically these projects are cleaned up by the major forces. All participants know that this is definitely a profitable project, and of course it will flood into Ilyan. Some of the big consortiums even put forward the idea of ​​“packaging” and want to swallow all the projects in the 8th district of Irian. in stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor of the city has naturally refused, and the introduction of so many forces from different regions and camps is to check and balance. If you really let a certain power whale swallow, maybe It is not the eighth district of Irian, but a special administrative area next to the city of Irian, and even another town, city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a round of fierce price shopping, many forces finally decided to decide what projects each power is responsible for, and those with the greatest future prospects are the best projects. It has long since disappeared, and there are only some marginal areas or projects that are not favored by people. Originally, the mayors of these projects did not intend to continue to invite other forces to divide them. They planned to do it themselves, which would be a deep imprint on this eighth district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, in this case, Du Lin could put his hand in, which really surprised him. Surprisingly surprised, but definitely not an accident, Du Lin solved a riot that may have criticized the reputation and prosperity of Irian yesterday. He saved not only the current Irian, but also the eighth district. Once there was a problem with Ilyan and it deteriorated sharply, those forces in the eighth district would never invest another penny in the bad place of the society, and even turned upside down to the city hall to meet some of their needs. Therefore, Du Lin's ability to be a finalist is also a reasonable thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised Scott was the wealth of Doolin, which was a club of 10 million yuan. Did he actually go in? Just by his jewelry store? It is impossible to think about this kind of thing. Scott inexplicably remembered the rumors about Doolin outside, saying that he sold people, opened private mines, and so on, maybe it was true? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s early to come!", Du Lin’s body was wet, only wearing a short swimming trunk, he just climbed from the pool Come out, the maid is wiping the body for him. After taking a bath towel and posing to the maid, he wiped the remaining water drops and put them on his shoulders. With Scott, he came to the pavilion in the garden. "How much do I have now?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott unveiled a reduced version of the plan, many of which were filled with color, and only a few places around it were still white. He pointed to a slightly larger white area and said: "In the planning, there is a need to build a playground. The very large one needs at least 5 million inputs, and may need to be added later."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced a little curiously and asked: "A playground should not be a project for everyone to fight for? Why is no one willing to invest in this project?" What theme parks are seen in the dreams of Dooling are cash cows, one of which has a yearly income of tens of billions of stars. According to the price and consumption of this world, there are still one or two hundred million less? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is not the mistake of these forces, but Du Lin himself is wrong. The mouse company that he saw in his dreams earned income from amusement parks and resorts, but he ignored the years that the mice used to let the people of the whole world accept the culture of the mouse and the mouse, which has accumulated over the past 100 years. Only created a pleasing income. And there is no theme park in this world. Most of the so-called amusement parks have some entertainment equipment, and then there are places where flowers and grasses and various stage plays are watched, and the amusement parks that Du Lin knows are not at all. One thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you put a few carousels and other things that can be seen everywhere, you can earn one or two hundred yuan a year. I am afraid that the new party leader, Magus, can’t help but shoot. And will you wait for him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin guessed from some of Scott’s strange expressions that he might be wrong. He shrugged his shoulders and made a direct shot. "I want this project." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott frowned and hesitated. "Are you sure? You know that this project is really not good. The reason for this amusement park is that Considering the needs of photography, it is purely for the entertainment of the citizens of Irian City. The professional financial experts at Xie Lisi Street think that it takes at least five to ten years to recover the cost!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want it!", Du Lin repeated it again. Others don't know how to make money in the amusement park. Can he not know? This may be the information that people in dreams often say is not equal. In the world of dreams, there are also many playgrounds that are not mouse-eaters. Every year, hundreds of millions of huge profits are lost. In particular, this playground is not completely without any theme. The eighth district itself is the theme. Those who have used the film, even some classic or popular movies, can be added to it. Of course, this also requires an additional agreement to operate at this time, he is not in a hurry, there is time before construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott chuckled a few times, and he actually wanted to save money for a super rich? It’s really a lot of thoughts. These people’s money can’t be spent, as long as they think they will be happy when they go out, maybe it’s worth it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took three projects in one breath, and his richness once again set a limit for Scott’s speculation on Doolin’s wealth. In addition to an amusement park that certainly does not make money, there is also a medium-sized farm and the construction of a rockery. To be honest, Scott has never seen such a wayward tycoon. Two of the three projects that Du Lin chose, even the City Hall, feel that it is 100% loss-making. The only profitable amusement park or what kind of 789 years In order to recover the cost of the project. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Scott was still worried that Du Lin had taken a look at other people’s projects. Now he is relieved, so everyone is fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total investment of the three projects is nine million, of which five million need to be used in amusement parks, and three million to build a real mountain. The remaining 500,000 is used for the construction of the farm. Scott completed his task, and Doolin felt that he was a good and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Scott doesn’t know that Du Lin’s use of only nine million is not reconciling because he still holds millions of dollars in cash and More than 20 million gold, he does not spend the money, how can he be satisfied? Of course, he won't tell Scott how he can snatch these items from other people's hands. After all, those ideas may be illegal. As he himself believes, there is still a lot of time before it breaks ground, even before acceptance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Doolin and Scott discussed how to spend money, a bunch of police officers entered the fifth district and began to detect the case of Abienne being murdered. Thanks to Abigail’s wife, who left the house after seeing Abigail’s body, and thanked the speculators who had incited the riots so that people did not damage the scene. The person in charge who was responsible for detecting the case quickly got a lot of important evidence, such as a few warheads, such as two shoe prints, such as a threat letter in the Abbien work table drawer and a thousand pieces. Envelope of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding to the words of Dooling, the Guars who are extremely concerned about this matter have begun to provide many useful and useless clues, among them. A clue caught the attention of the case handlers. When a guart worker was accidentally mechanically crushed to death at work last week, Abbey was running this thing, and finally won 4,500 pieces of compensation for the family of the victim. The families of the victims also personally came to the door to thank Abigail for everything they did, and many people even respected Abigail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
