			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am planning to participate in this general election. You know that there will be a goal at every stage of your life. Now my new goal is to campaign." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin smiled twice. "Why do I feel that you are showing off how rich you are? Well, don't say this, I can help you find the campaign team." Look, but you'd better be able to come over in person, it's very important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every campaign team has its own style, often for different The situation chooses different teams. It is very important for successful elections. Politicians are selecting teams. In fact, the team is also selecting politicians. Not every single business is willing to accept. For these campaign teams, guaranteeing their own winning percentage is the only way to improve their own worth. They are like lawyers. A lot of successful lawyers... except Kevin, this is that as long as the money is given, he will pick up everything, but the more famous lawyers besides Kevin, the more difficult it is to take over any case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a barrister’s degree, unless it’s under the influence of money and power, barristers rarely pick up that kind of social influence. In the case, they are more willing to pick up cases like divorce. These cases are not too difficult, and the chances of winning them are great, and the income they can get is very high. The purpose of every lawyer studying for justice is never to maintain the justice of the law. They just want to find enough loopholes in the rules of the judiciary to pass through this wall and enter the ocean of powerful wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true for the campaign team. The more successful the campaign team, the less likely they will accept any commission. They need to analyze the entire campaign environment and political factors to ensure that Their own team and agents will be able to win in the next campaign, paving the way for the next service cost of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin agreed to it, he is now in the city of Otis, a few hours away from the emperor. Of course, it’s already late, and it’s useless to rush him over. After washing a few phone calls, he washes and sleeps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Doolin drove the Buddha and the two-car bodyguards directly to the Royal Capital, and saw Kevin before lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"New crutches?", Du Lin glanced at the crutches in the hands of this guy with some "artistic breath" and couldn't help but ask. This crutches look like some kind of log, but it's constantly twisted and some knots give people a sense of not being able to say it. Especially when it was Kevin in the hands, it felt a bit... Du Lin said that it was not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin nodded in surprise. He stood still and raised his cane to show off. "How, good? This is a masterpiece of an artist. Do you know, in order to win this crutches?" It cost 3,500 yuan, but it is worth it. I like it very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin echoed, the empire always has some masters Such people eat, an inexplicable piece of work hires a bunch of people to advocate, worthless things can become very valuable, and then there is a group of stupid money to fight for money in the embarrassing pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water in this line of art is very deep. When he was in the city of Tener, he knew some art circles from Delil’s gun. Insider, for example, the three major art galleries of the Empire, often have some rookie painters in their own exhibitions in the three major museums, and then their works began to advance by leaps and bounds, one by one became a celebrity of contemporary art, and soon disappeared. In fact, the three major pavilions, including some other very well-known art galleries, will have similar individual art exhibitions, but the art exhibitions and art exhibitions are also different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people spend their money temporarily renting the venue and then exhibiting their own artwork. They don’t add art to the official title when they promote it. The name of the pavilion, such as the "xx Personal Art Exhibition" commonly seen in newspapers. There is also an art exhibition held in an art gallery. The art exhibition will add the name of the art museum, such as the "xx Art Museum xx Personal Art Exhibition", and will be named in the following as the art gallery. Not an individual. This has caused many people who are not knowledgeable to be deceived. In fact, it is said that there is no authority, and a person with a certain degree of authority and ignorance does not think that all the activities held in an art gallery must be the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, it’s actually different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This set of operations is very popular with art scammers, enough to deceive many people who don’t understand. In recent years, many young artists from abroad and the Federation are renting Empire III. The museum held its own personal art exhibition, and then returned to the country to become a master of art. It was deeply loved by the layman and successfully embarked on the peak of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be aware of Du Lin’s real thoughts. Kevin snorted and shook his head. “I’m really stupid, I’m talking about art with you.” It’s the biggest mistake.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also said, “I won’t argue with my nephew because I am compassionate.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin gnashed his teeth and said, "If it wasn't for my legs, I would kill you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his fist, shook, Kevin silenced For a few seconds, "Let's talk about the campaign team..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the trouble, the two entered Kevin’s study, in order to wait for Du Lin specially invited a vacation today. After being mixed up in the Justice Department for a long time, Kevin has gradually adapted to the bureaucratic style of the imperial government. He is now the biggest prosecutor, but he has the least amount of work. It seems that this is an unreasonable thing, because there is no better use of such excellent resources, but in the government department, this is the most correct approach. If you let Kevin perform too well, it means that others are too useless, and Kevin's light will gradually cover them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keving Gao Wen’s high, he should give him his welfare, let him be promoted when he is promoted, and use him as an example anyway. It will be right. There is nothing to complain about Kevin. He is not disgusted with such a life. After all, the main job is his mixed qualifications. When the mix is ​​almost the same, if Du Lin really comes to power, at least his resume will not be too ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two sat down, Kevin asked a maid to bring a drink and some snacks, closed the door, and he talked about Du Lin’s concerns. "I asked you about it yesterday. Until last night, almost all the hot teams have already received work, including some second-rate teams, and they all started working. Simply put, you are 'late'." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The campaign is not a matter of starting immediately and ending immediately. Kevin learned a little about it yesterday. Maggs’ campaign team started for three years from a year ago. After the general election, the preparatory work began. Some campaign teams with very successful success stories have already entered the work almost six months ago. Although the campaign said that it is to spend money to buy support, there is another job behind this, that is, spending money to buy opposition - to make people feel disgusted with all their opponents, which also requires manpower and material expenditure, just a lot of campaigns The team includes candidates and will not disclose such things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sooner the campaign is over, some politicians are inexplicably exposed to various black materials, or to various political crises, all from their campaign opponents. Everyone will do this, but they will never say it, so it will take longer to study the campaign strategy and develop counter-attack countermeasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at Kevin after listening. The two looked at each other for a moment. Kevin was a little crazy. "What do you want to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You let I came to the Imperial Capital and told me that there is no suitable team right now, just like this?", Du Lin couldn't help but order a cigarette, "Surprise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; &nbsp; "Surprise?", Kevin shrugged his shoulders, "No surprises...", watching Du Lin frown, Kevin smiled, "dangdangdangdang, okay, there is a surprise, etc. A surprise will appear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know when I slept last night?" Kevin extended two fingers, " At two o'clock in the middle of the night, this is the latest time I have been sleeping for half a year. I have contacted you with a very good guy. As long as you can get enough money, this bastard will help you complete your request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin breathed a sigh of relief, in case there was no surprise, it was troublesome, and the complexity of the campaign was absolutely super People's imagination, although it will make people think it is not difficult. If there is no qualified team, he is really a bit scalp, but Kevin is a good bastard, helping him solve this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Simply say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s changes in some details can’t fool Kevin This rogue lawyer is not a lawyer now, but the professional quality has not been put down. Through the observation of the subtle expression, he knows that his surprise has succeeded. At this time, he was satisfied with the fear of Du Lin, and he introduced the team he was looking for for Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team he found is not strictly a campaign team in the strict sense, because this is their first time participating in the campaign service, in the past They have a very great name called the Royal Policy Research Group, which, in modern terms, is one of the royal think tanks. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known that Magus took the emperor off the stage of power and refused the extravagance and waste of the royal family on the grounds of "not suitable", reducing the expenses of the royal family. So far, the royal family has been renting the right to use some industries to live. Occasionally, some industries will be sold, such as the manor on the outskirts of the Imperial City, and the money will be used to maintain the current decent life of the royal family. Naturally, some people who used to serve the royal family were unemployed in the new era. Some people have earned enough money in the past, went home to support the elderly, and some people are still struggling to survive in this society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
