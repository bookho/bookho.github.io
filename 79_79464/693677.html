			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s group had just sat down for a long time, and the ringtone of the name rang. The Ternell District Prison routinely performs three daily names, before breakfast, after lunch and before turning off the lights. At this time everyone must appear in the prison. If someone is missing, all the people in the prison will be punished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s worth noting that here is missing, not in other situations, and Buddha tells Du Lin that sometimes there are always special problems that require special treatment, so The prisoners held here basically have a certain degree of "disease". These diseases will be registered on each prisoner's personal information card. In case of any sudden illness, the prison has sufficient reasons and excuses. Solve this trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prisoners can die in prison, but they must not escape. Even though the prison is doing this, there are still people who can run out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about seventeen people who can successfully escape from the prison in the history of the Tern district prison. Individuals, the success of these people is often done on the premise of sacrificing several times the companion - because if one chooses to escape from prison, it means that he will at least pull the three people in his prison to join him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, in turn, involves some other hidden rules in the prison, such as not being able to inform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information is an act that everyone hates. No matter what the reason, you must learn to close your mouth, otherwise it is not as simple as the hostility of two people. It is subject to hatred and hostility by all prisoners throughout the prison. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a rich man who had lost his hand in a runaway fight because of his arrogance. Under a lot of money power offensive, this young man He was sentenced to five years in prison. His father promised him that he would help him leave the prison as soon as possible and would not let him wait too long. The guy who lived in an emotional indulgence from an early age quickly offended most people in the prison, including prison guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he followed the five thugs who had changed their money, and no one dared to do it to him easily. This situation lasted for half a month. The prison guard told him that if he wanted to leave here as soon as possible, he must have the performance of “achievement of merit”. There is no doubt that “reporting illegal activities” is the fastest way in prison. He didn't know that it was a trap, and then he reported that a guy "collected" some sharp edges and was given a one-year penalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was only happy for three days and died on the court that he could touch when he was free. His "thug" bodyguards did not protect his safety. More than 30% of the prisoners were responsible for his death. After the final approval, the guy died of sudden heart disease and died! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Du Lin is actually sick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three prison guards stood outside the last prison on the second floor of Area A. They glanced at the situation in the prison and quickly turned away. This is a "villa" because there are six beds in this house, which are dedicated to those who are rich, powerful, have a little power, are in urgent need of protection and are willing to pay. So the people who live in the last prison in each district are basically a bit of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of prison guards are actually not willing to offend too much, after living here means that the sentence will soon pass, these for them Since the big guys can get privilege here, they will be even more amazing once they go out. It is too embarrassing to offend them. The last unfortunate thing is yourself. Why bother to offend others for the sake of others? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of naming is going very fast, the prisoners have already had experience, and the prison guards are also, they can check every room in the fastest time. After the end, a burst of hot steam is sprayed in the door lock gap of all the trains. The sound generated by the mechanical metal friction is transmitted from the wall, and then the lock spring is pushed and the door is slowly opened. The omnipotent crystal maintains the operation of the whole world. Sometimes I don't know how to do it in the world if one day the crystal disappears completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is the time to dine. The breakfast in the prison was very "rich". There was a meat patties that didn't know what meat to make. About half of the palms were big, not very thick, but there was a lot of oil spilling out of the patties. There is a bowl of porridge with wheat kernels, very few wheat kernels, lots of water, and a few raw vegetables. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time Du Lin was eating this kind of meal, he still had a high degree of curiosity about everything here. He took his plate and walked to the table. When I had time to sit down, a strong man suddenly squeezed from behind his back, and the crowded Du Lin could barely stand. When he looked back at the brawny, the brawny looked at Doolin a little surprised, because the plate that Du Lin had in his hand did not fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are unintentional, then you should apologize to me. If you are interested in doing this, then...", Doolin’s words have not been finished. And a few strong men stood up, they stood behind the man, looking at Duan with a sly face or a sinister look. One of them, Du Lin, also knew that the guy who had previously ostriched him. At this time, if he still doesn't know what is going on, he has no need to go out for revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is my intention, what do you want?", the man looked down at Du Lin and asked provocatively. His man is taller than Doolin, and his face is shivering slightly, and the real and scary capital. Doolin was a little shorter and thinner in front of him, and it looked like he was vulnerable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others may be afraid of him, but Doolin will not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment Du Lin’s plate was directly pressed by his strong face on the face of the strong man, and the broken wooden plate changed from no harm. It is full of danger. He grabbed a cracked piece of wood and forced it into the guy's chest. The brawny needs to thank this is a piece of broken wood, not the kind of small awl that is specially made to hurt or kill. The sharp mouth was inserted into the muscles for about a centimeter and was bitten by the pectoralis major. He raised his hand and punched him on the face of the strong man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha behind him immediately lost his plate in the first place, even though the plates he dumped and the food scattered around did not Any lethality, but under the instinctive role, there are still many people who stick out their heads and even take a step back. Dufo’s hand pressed on Doolin’s shoulder. Du Lin seemed to understand what he meant for a moment. He sank a little. With the strength of his arms and bounce, he was bracing with Doolin’s shoulders and his feet were straight. Stepped on the guy's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A war broke out in an instant, and the restaurant in the entire prison was sensational. For those prisoners who are working in addition to eating, it is so lucky to be able to enjoy such a "happy" performance when they eat early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding noise is noisy, squeaky, snoring, snoring, extraordinarily noisy. But Doolin’s heart was very calm. He remembered that he had told him that in order to avoid the large-scale casualties of prisoners in the fighting, almost everything in the prison was fixed, including tables and stools. But there is one thing that is not fixed, that is, the stool surface, which is simply a round seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is often bad. Some provincial people like to eat on the stool, and there are often cases where the seat plate is damaged. In order to facilitate the replacement of these seat plates, the seat plate is not fixed, but is stuck. The reason why it is not fixed by screws or other means is to prevent prisoners from stealing the fixed metal parts and making jailbreak or hurting things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
