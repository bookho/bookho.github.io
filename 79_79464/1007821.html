			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if these former slaves have the temptation to the empire, the hatred of these slave traders, so that they can shoot and kill the slave traders in front of them without hesitation, But they still can't do as good military qualities as a real soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullets from the inside of the car directly shredded the young man’s head, and five sharp metal fragments took his life. In fact, he can not die here, just need to hide a little, but the problem is that he did not do that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, dozens of people rushed out of the room in the supply station. Some people fired guns into the sky and asked the passengers to roll back into the compartment. Another group of people began to attack each section of the car. They also shouted before the attack, let the people inside surrender and ensure the safety of the other party, but this kind of behavior has little effect, especially when their companions are killed when they show their heads. If the outside of the carriage is an empire's military or police, they may surrender, at least they don't have to worry about being killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside group seems to be nothing like military, police, etc., which is estimated to be black and black. Don't expect God to reach out to help you when you are alive, just as you never expect him to push you into hell after you die. This sentence is quite reasonable. Instead of resisting it, don't resist the arrival of death. It's better to fight it, maybe you can win it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaotic gun battle lasted for a long time, and the pungent bloody smell made the passenger compartment full of crying sounds and cursing sounds - not cursing the outside of the car Those "robbers", but cursing those who are crying, let them close their mouths, do not attract the robbers into the carriage! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanity is sometimes so interesting. The party we treat with kindness must reflect our toughness and authority. The party that treats terrorist violence must be as compromised as possible. It is not the distortion of human nature, but the real growth of people, knowing what qualities they should show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshots that lasted for more than 20 minutes finally subsided completely, all the compartment doors were opened, and the "robbers" looked at the compartments. Everything, as they have suffered, is like a hell. The slightly younger women curled up in the corners of the carriage, either indifferent to changes in the outside world or a little crazy. Men and children are also full of numbness, and the sick face is a desperate gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My compatriots, you are free!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence has been translated into more than twenty languages ​​in each hard drive compartment. The undressed people gradually recovered their minds, and they had a look in their eyes. They did not dare to look at everything that happened, but the truth was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the slaves were rescued and transferred, the group quickly left, and the train conductor was frightened and waited for ten minutes at the supply station and did not see anyone coming back. After that, I was completely relieved. He asked the flight attendants to help them change the catalyst and start the train to the next stop as quickly as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news that the slave train was robbed went on in the west, but everyone who knew it was not exactly the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mine owners know this, the performance is very calm, and even can be said to be indifferent. The loss of those slave traders has nothing to do with them. They think that the people who have stolen the slaves may be the local stables of the stables in the west. I don’t know which group is too poor, and even a few hundred and one hundred The slaves are not willing to let go. Mixing like this, I still dare not rob the mining area. This group of robbers can only be described by waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horses and bandits know this, and they are all guessing whether a big man has opened a new mine recently and has come up with a big order. His own peers, this allowed his peers to rob the steam locomotive. When some mine owners are under pressure to mine a mine, they have no time to place orders for slave traders to wait for the next transaction. So they will make a bonus offer, or directly assign a familiar criminal gang to get what they want for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it’s a matter of course to pay a portion of the money. The risk of looting steam locomotives is so great that the return is of course higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official hearing of this news is nothing more than a pain in the painful headache, anyway, the trouble is like a scorpion, there are two or two times It will make you feel uncomfortable, but the scorpion is more than a certain degree. One is uncomfortable, the other is uncomfortable, and it is not difficult to get used to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the doorman..., it’s not the matter that he has a headache, it’s another thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, he used a bloody dawn old man as the party's whip of the Kadima Party to maintain his orthodox image status, but soon he had some conceptual conflicts with the party whip. He chose a radical approach to lead the Kadima Party to participate in this political game as soon as possible, and hopes to get the position of the governor as soon as possible, and then compete for the supreme power of the empire. However, the party whip, that is, the old Mr. Shapke, thinks that the doorstep is too big. The cooperation with the capitalist is like ordering the house to warm up. If you accidentally, you will let the majesty give birth to a torn soul. Pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people’s different views also made the Kadima first great disagreement after the establishment of the party. Finally, the doorkeeper let his secretary convince the sand. Puck. If the leader of the Kadima Party is Mr. Kesma, Shapke can sacrifice himself to wake him up, but the current leader is only the horse dealer of the Mennon, and Mr. Shapke does not intend to die for him, so he takes one. Those who have a common philosophy have left the Kadima party to return to the wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just from the night of last night to this morning, Shapke suddenly stood up and said, he directly questioned whether the policy of the Mennon in the west could continue smoothly. Going on, and then questioning whether the Mennon became the leader of the Kadima Party is a legitimate inheritance. In other words, Shapke believes that the doorman has stolen the benefits of the bloody dawn, he is not a good person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone else questioned these problems, the problem caused to the doormen was absolutely not so much caused by Shapuk’s words, Shapuke’s establishment from the dawn of Scarlett One day is a member organization. It can be said that he is one of the founders of the bloody dawn. His words are very authoritative, far from the fact that the horse-man trader can compare. There are some discordant voices in the party. Some people think that the current door-to-door peasant has moved away from everyone’s original idea - change this. The times, let everyone live a happy life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although everyone knows that this is a nonsense of the horse, but how to be nonsense, this is also the "program" established by the bloody dawn. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers have cooperated with the capitalists in recent years, and they have acquired the friendship of the capital class by jointly exploiting the working class with the capitalists to oppress the west, in order to sell all the people in the west. The interests of leverage have instigated their power in the political arena. His actions, his practices, have seriously violated the program, and Shapuk’s words immediately swayed some people, and these people are also the backbone members of the Kadima Party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman is very good at camouflage. He makes all his actions seem to create a beautiful era for everyone, such as the three guarantee policy. But in turn, think carefully, behind all his policies, there are more or less the shadow of some capitalists. He has betrayed the program and betrayed the original intention of the bloody dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, human nature is always complicated. Some people are pursuing a purely idealized world, and some people are willing to stand on the ground in a down-to-earth manner. Some people oppose the door farmers, then naturally there will be a group of people to support the door farmers, these are the vested interests of the doormen after the political stage. In the past, they were members of extremist organizations who could not see the light. Now they can wear a formal dress, and the oily face is swaying in front of people and has the power to be big or small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are no longer living mice in the sewers, but people living in the sun, they support the doormen from the heart, and hope that the farmers can continue Go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden crisis within the party has already seen signs of splitting. Once some members of the Kadima Party are separated from the party, this will become the biggest political stain of the Mennon. Affects all his next plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must resolve this matter as soon as possible, before the eyes of the people of the whole country are concentrated in the west! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want from me?", Mennon is a bit embarrassed at this time, and has a completely different change from his usual image. He tore his own collar, rubbed his own hair, bent down and sat on the chair, whispering in a low voice: "It doesn't help you to stink me, Shapke! You can't be a leader. No one wants to follow you. If I fail, it means that all of us have failed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not the success I want, the door Agriculture." The sound of Shapke in the receiver is aging, but it is very firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer suddenly got up and grabbed the ashtray on his hand and threw it out. "What do you want? Money? Power? Status? Woman?" Or is it a bullet that hits your head?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Tell me, you bastard, how can you stop what you are doing? "Stupid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have known for thirty years, I never thought that the first person who slaps me in the back is you, Shapke!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other one on the phone Shapk laughed. "It’s twenty-six, three, three, eleven days, and I need to remind you that you will always It’s the treacherous horse dealer who dressed up the Hummer as a health horse.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
