			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicole is the name of this angry worker who developed a two-step plan with muscle. The first step was to attack an immigrant settlement. Although Du Lin and the state government provided two residential communities for these immigrants, they were too far from the mainstream industrial clusters. Most immigrants lived on the edge of each city, looking for a piece. Cheap land, and then build a simple shack, so that they do not need to take the train across the city when they go to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second step is to attack the factory he had previously worked for. He wants the manager to understand the consequences of deceiving him and throwing his personal dignity on the ground. He wants all entrepreneurs and immigrants to know that the rules in the West should be observed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being simple to almost no plot, more than 20 people rushed to an immigrant settlement with sticks and some hunting knives. This residential area is on the edge of the city, because immigrants do not like to enjoy the attitude so that they do not have any requirements for the quality of life, if there is, then as long as the cost of living is the lowest. This has allowed a large number of immigrants to live in the most remote and dirty areas of a city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nicole chose such a gathering place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they rushed into this place, they did not find many people. Most of the immigrants who came to the empire from other regions are real laborers, each of them In addition to obtaining a residence permit, the purpose of coming to the empire is to export labor. In fact, in the empire's society, these immigrants are willing to pay their own wages to work. Their low wages are horrendous, but people have never learned that the low wages in the eyes of the people they now take mean what they mean in their hometown. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s definitely a good high salary, and it can be compared with some white-collar workers, so they don’t mind taking the initiative to lower their income to get a stable job. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the time there are not many people in the residential area, most of them are working, at least very few are temporarily not working, or are sick, or The family members are still in the simple home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nike's group of people did not find many people when they rushed in. They originally came with a kind of hate and determination, and did not expect to rush. An empty one, after the beating of a few young people, everyone's anger was not vented, and then some of them suggested burning this bad house. This proposal has been well matched by other people. The houses here are all spliced ​​with wooden structures. There are also some waste plates of other materials like industrial waste, which are very easy to ignite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They made some torches, lit the first house, and then the second, and finally the shacks of the entire residential area were almost burning. They laughed at the flames of the sky, and they vented their anger and injustice, feeling that life had reached a climax. But where they didn't notice, some red-eyed immigrants were quietly approaching them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combat, and then started, which also made Nicole’s second-step plan not yet available, and it was over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these immigrants, it is very difficult to have a temporary home in the empire, and there are some former slaves, perhaps here. Cole and others are just a place like garbage dumps, but for immigrants, they are the hard-won homes of the empire. They are eager to accept some people's discriminatory gaze in the empire society, and silently endure some unfair treatment, but all this is for a reason, because they have a dream, they must be rooted in the empire, they have to have a home here. Even a simple house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who have never experienced these things will never understand, warmth may be cheap, but they can let people spend the cold winter, now cover them with snow The home was burned by a group of inexplicable mobs, and all their savings were burned out. The deep despair made these people reluctant to remain silent and they had to do what they were supposed to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to some people staying here, some people ran to nearby factories to inform immigrant workers, more and more people holding sticks and the like. The things rushed over, and Nicole and others were surrounded by a group of people, and they could not find a place to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They originally came to vent their negative emotions, but they didn't expect them to be a way of venting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the immigrants stopped because of their tiredness, they all changed their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no good endings by being surrounded by a group of angry workers who are doing the hardest and heaviest jobs in the West with the lowest wages, even if they used to Not so strong, this year is enough for them to become strong. No one in the group will care if someone who is dying is really dying. They will only instinctively let those who are still moving and can talk to others can’t move. . Once the factors of bloodthirsty violence are released, it is difficult to reconverge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the open space in the crowd, there were more than a dozen people lying on the ground, and seven of them were not breathing and lost their heartbeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter quickly reached the regional police station. After the police came out, they realized the seriousness of the problem and brought all the participants back. The police station, on the other hand, informed the workers’ union, as well as the city hall and the state government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very dangerous case. A bad deal can easily lead to a series of social problems. All the managers have become very worried. Finally, this The matter also let Du Lin know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was something going wrong..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha said this in the ear of Doolin At the time, Du Lin was chatting with several guests. On the night of the princess's birthday party, he made a limelight. The princess's "best gift" directly made Du Lin the deserved protagonist in the birthday party. Coupled with his temptation and personal charm, and his willingness to follow the rules to join the game, the aristocratic group easily accepted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like an absurd and funny stage play. Once this circle was strictly guarded against Doolin, even if he made many changes and breakthroughs, he could not People accept his existence. But at this moment, these people took the initiative to include him in this circle, because he began to abide by the rules of the game. To be honest, Du Lin himself was very surprised. He thought it would take a long time for the nobles to accept this fact. But the fact is that the nobles came to visit him the next day, which made him feel like he couldn't tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and sinned and stood up to the second floor, and Buddha whispered a detailed explanation of what happened in the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, no one thought that things would develop to this point. A group of workers who lost their jobs because of migrant workers and were unwilling to accept workers’ unions decided to make trouble. They attacked A place of residence for a foreign immigrant in the city. Westerners have always used themselves on their own sites, and the immigrants of these immigrants are usually humble. Even if they spit at them on the side of the road and say a few words, they will not stop the theory, but they will leave quickly with their heads down. This also makes many people feel that these immigrants are small and are a group of small chickens. Even if they beat them, they won’t say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this group of immigrants broke out at this time. They killed seven locals. They didn’t know who was revealed. It has caused some problems. Workers’ unions sent a team of lawyers to prosecute all immigrants who participated in the fight, and incited public opinion to demand the most severe punishment. On the other hand, some immigrants have a good mix, such as Amon, who also took out a lot of money to hire some lawyers and are defending those immigration work. The rapid fermentation of this matter in a very short period of time is no longer a conflict between the two groups of people and has become a conflict between the two groups of society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
