			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A police car with a police emblem slowly entered the estate of Gotol, and Codord voluntarily came out of the house. He has not yet become a tycoon. Even if he becomes a tycoon, he also needs to show certain respect to Prando. Who will make the cockroaches on his ass unclean forever? If Prando really wants to find him trouble, whether he is a tycoon or not, it will be very troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For trouble, people tend to show disgust, but at the same time they show some respect for things that create trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Codor is wearing a white shirt and a straight suit that looks no different from the high-class tycoons in the city. He also tried to use waxing from yesterday, which may have been influenced by Wood. He felt that he could show his tribute to the rules regardless of whether he could cross the threshold in the future. He was psychologically prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Prando came down from the car, the smile on his face flashed in an instant, and as he stepped down the steps, he also extended his hands. After the wrist, an inch-long shirt cuff was spotless, white was a bit dazzling, and he walked enthusiastically to Prando, clenching his hands with Prando's fat toes and shaking it. He wants Prando to feel the heat of his palm, which is the temperature of enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the wind that blows you to me?", Codor released his hand and reached out to make an invitation, sideways Prando walked toward the house. This is what he learned in the etiquette class. He spent a great deal looking for a royal retired etiquette to teach him some of the daily etiquette of the upper class. At the same time, it also made him realize that it would be completely meaningless to insist on the current path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hundred lessons, only one thirty minutes. You can be expensive or not, but there are more people who want to learn, and this is the etiquette that Codor has asked for a big boss. The more you touch something in the upper class, the more you feel your own smallness. This is a good thing for Codor, because he can finally understand that he is not burly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While walking towards the house under the guidance of Godor, while rubbing the sweat on his forehead with a handkerchief, he squinted at the song Er, sneered, and did not answer his question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sneer stunned Gedore’s inexplicable heart, the smile on his face had such a moment of stiffness, but he was hiding very well, converting It was also very fast, no longer asking about this question, and always led Prando into his study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very luxurious study, the camel's carpet on the ground is one inch thick, and when you step on it, you can feel like stepping on the butter and there is a slight depression. The golden and red wallpapers decorate the entire room with magnificent brilliance, gorgeous lighting and some decoration that make it like the residence of some top tycoons, or the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando went straight to the desk and sat down in a fully enclosed chair, sighing comfortably. He hooked his fingers, and the old policeman who followed the two gave him the file bag in his hand. He slammed it on the table and licked his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s suspiciously picked up the portfolio and pulled out a file from it, and the pupil instantly shrank. He calmly placed Cod's file on the table and frowned slightly. "I don't understand very well, Mr. Secretary. If you come here for the previous swearing and obituary, I feel unnecessary, even the city court. They all made the final verdict, according to the Imperial Law... In short, after the final judgment, the reasons for the end have not been pursued."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Empire Law There is indeed such a thing. It is popular to say that the existence of this law was formulated by the nobles in the past to protect their own interests. Any crime can only be tried once. After the final judgment, whether it is a misjudgment or not, the crime will be regarded as "treated" and will no longer be pursued by the law and the parties. The aristocrats used this law to do a lot of "good things", and now this law is also abused by criminals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cartor is a gang leader, but that doesn't mean he can learn nothing. He has a book, and in the 379 books placed in the bookcase behind Prando, there are only six insignificant books. He didn't... I looked at it carefully, and he didn't have time to look at it. But these six books all involve theocracy and imperial law. He remembers his boss told him that a clever butcher not only knows how to kill pigs, but also how to sharpen the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as long as he has a need for sleep, he will take one of them, look at three or five pages, and then fall asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With so many books, he can always remember a little bit of content, and this one he can probably remember, because many times he also needs to use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando looked at Codor, and Córder greeted his gaze without fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Codor wants to show his own arrogance. His etiquette teacher told him this way. When he wants to express some controversial choice, he can calmly look at other people’s eyes and express his own frankness. serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Prando's point of view, this stepping horse is challenging yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sneered and stood up from the all-enclosed sofa, holding the police cap that he had just thrown on the table, sweeping his pants," Since this is the case, then I have nothing to say, let me say!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can it not work? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coldor is also not ceremonially rude. He knows that the police chief like Prando can not come to him personally. Something happened. Now let Prando go, what if there is any accident in the back? Who are you going to cry when you arrive? He took Prando with a flattering smile and pressed him into the chair and immediately took a "land of love" from his desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Happy Land” is not earth, it looks like a group of slightly dry and loose soil. This kind of thing is actually a fungus similar to mushroom hyphae. It looks like a dark brown color of the earth. It likes to have a certain amount of sunlight, but it cannot be directly exposed to sunlight. Most of it grows at the top of the cave entrance. This fungus is very peculiar, it emits a very special fragrance when it burns, it can calm the intense emotions, and it also produces an inexplicable little happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was once a special product of the provincial dynasty. After the provincial dynasty was conquered by the Yaoxing Empire, it became a special product of the Yaoxing Empire. The main producing areas are located in the southeastern part of the empire, and they are sought after by the aristocrats who like to pursue pleasure, and they are almost extinct and almost extinct. It is now the economic pillar of the two states and is mainly used by the upper social circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of its special effects, people call it "Happy Land"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are twelve boxes of ordinary land, ranging from five hundred to six hundred. If it is a wild earth fungus, the price is basically more than one thousand, and there are only six in a box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, this is not a wild hyphae, but a captive. After all, relying on the sale of this thing can prop up the finances of the two states, you can imagine how valuable this thing is! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
