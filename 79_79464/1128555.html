			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knock on the door alarmed the people in the room, and even the teacher couldn’t help but look back at the ringed door, although he could not pass through the door. Who is seeing the door? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is there?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impatience of the voice coming out of the door, "Is there someone calling pizza? I will open the door soon, I have other things." There were some minor words coming down, like talking to myself. "The place where this bitch is raised is really a horse, and I don't know if I can go back."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher took back his eyes and looked at other people. "Someone ordered a pizza?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The takeaway is not something new, at ten It existed a few years ago. At that time, many middle-class people would pass some restaurant fast food restaurants before going to work. At noon, they needed to deal with it and then quickly re-enter it to work. If too much time was wasted to eat. On the way - eating - on the way back from the place of eating, is obviously a negation of their own value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there is an initial form of take-out, the restaurant will pack a large number of meals and send them to the white-collar workers at noon. At that time, every city is bustling. The location is just a small place, and it can be delivered in almost one breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the development of technology and the passage of time, the emergence of the phone has solved a lot of troubles and problems, making the take-out more active. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one phone call is needed, and soon someone will deliver the meal to the door, which is definitely for most people who don’t want to cook or cook. God gives them the gospel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big-faced bearded man grabbed the soft scorpion, and then raised his hand a little, "Sorry, my stomach is hungry."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher gave him a look, then turned his head and turned to the door to open the door, holding the box with the pizza in his hand, mouth watering The courier had 80% change and then opened the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, he called the courier, "Why are you adding eggs? I remember I didn't ask for eggs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the box held in his hand, there were three slightly solidified eggs in the middle of the pizza covered with ketchup and cheese. He didn't like to eat eggs. He had a slight slightness to the egg yolk except that he thought it was strong. Allergies, it will make him very uncomfortable. He went to see a doctor. The doctor said that this is a psychological reaction, not a physical problem. If you can't overcome it, the easiest way is to not eat eggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-step-away mealkeeper stopped and still kept an impatient tone. "You don't like to eat eggs? Then you like me." "Is it an egg?", after he said that he was not waiting for the fire, he followed him. "If you don't like it, just dig it up and throw it away. Do you want your mother to teach you how to do it before you know how to deal with these things?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter’s lips continued to change for a short time but there was no sound, but he could see what he said, it was a very dirty word, he Suddenly angry, holding the box to catch up, shouting in the mouth, "Bastard, you dare to look down on me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it was discovered that the physique of the 腮 腮Extra wide, perhaps realizing that his service attitude is very bad, the attitude of the food delivery staff immediately softened, "What do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asked, "How much is the egg, how much is the cost of adding three eggs, how much is not to add eggs, how much is the amount of beef?... What I want is Pizza is not a tomato egg pizza, you take the egg away and give me more money..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two have a good meal for the waiter I glanced at the three eggs that were mixed with the earth and left without looking back. After he rode out for about three or four hundred meters, he suddenly stopped, knocked on the window of a residential house on the side of the road, and then left by car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, Savi is using a sheepshoe to wipe the bayonet in his hand. After a few years of growth, Savi is already a big man. At the security company, he is not old. The biggest, but most respected, kind of heartfelt. Regardless of the training of any military project, he has always maintained the top three. When others have already taken a break, he is still practicing. The serious attitude and his identity background make many people respect him very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note, it is not pure because he is serious, and he can remain serious after having a different status. This is why people respect him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are all very strange animals. The more intelligent humans know the world, the more they deviate from the normal threshold. A hard-working person is not necessarily respected by people because there are too many people working hard in the world, and there are countless people who work harder than hard. It is respectable for people who are arrogant and arrogant in their status to maintain their enthusiasm. Is this respect respecting his efforts or respecting his status? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A worker who does not go home after work at noon may not have any thoughts. I think this is what he should do. But a big capitalist, the company's president who works overtime at noon will be respectable, and it is already this status. It is still so dedication and great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when people’s values ​​seem to have deviated from the right track, and even efforts have become what the dignitaries can embody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Du Lin asked Savy to shoot him not to kill him, but to kidnap one or two people. If one or two people are killed in the current situation, it is okay to say that if there are too many people killed, it is very likely to cause a strong rebound of the immigrant group. As the people in the room stated, Du Lin’s influence on the immigrant group is rapidly declining. More and more immigrants who migrated later will not recognize Du Lin because Du Lin did not help them. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are more convinced of the power of unity, because it has been proven to be the most correct choice so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, it’s actually very simple to break this piece of trouble, that is, to create a few “traitors” to differentiate the immigrant group. The degree of solidarity, and then give a little benefit, completely break up the situation of holding a group. When a group of people are not united and have more voices and opinions, they are not afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin gave them some help, they didn’t recognize him and thanked him for everything he did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traitors will also be the "examples" of the future, the founders of the living "empire dreams", they will become a template, a look It seems that the template can be copied, so that the immigrants can make better efforts towards the Empire Dream and give all the power to the Empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, these influential small group representatives discussed the next countermeasures after meeting and ended the meeting. The teacher was the first to leave, and the others left in succession, leaving only two people still in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Hu, and a 18-year-old boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young boy looked at the hustle and bustle slowly biting the last piece of pizza, his face has no expression of enjoyment, but a painful look. The amount of this pizza is too big. He miscalculated his own weight and could not stop it. This kind of thing can be put in the winter for a couple of days in the winter. Now it is a hot summer day. As long as one night, there will be many small lives on this pizza tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid waste, he can only hold on to the scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not right to do this!" The boy suddenly said, which caused the movements in the hands and mouth of the shackles to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put a little bit of pizza back in the box, then stroked his stomach, at this moment he felt that the boy could understand his pain and ask Dao, "Do you think so?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager’s eyes looked a little scattered and looked at the dark night outside, and he looked at it with a dignified look. Head, "The teacher is too proud, can be said to be conceited. He always thinks that only he is a smart person, others are fools, he is too conceited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The boss who immediately stunned his eyes, "Is this what you see? No wonder his eyes have always made me feel a little uncomfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juvenile The gaze gradually condensed, slightly frowned and looked at the 腮 腮 Σ:Σ(°△°|||)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We...the fear is not in a thinking channel let's go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a slap in the table, but I didn’t realize that what he heard and what he thought was not the same thing. "We are obviously a group." The teacher, the bastard actually thinks that I am a fool. I must find him to find out the account tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager sighed and raised his hand. Lived in the face, this group of people, afraid to be finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These immigrants originally occupied the greatest advantage of moral high ground. It is okay for other immigrants to go to the demonstrations. This is just a relatively intense but not crossed. In order to seek a means of resolving appeals. But then the sudden outbreak of conflict has completely caused immigrants to lose their biggest advantage - the victim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the victim to the perpetrator, I also thought about going through the life of the superior, only to say that the teachers and their people’s brains are broken. Not only can they come up with such ridiculous methods, but those people actually believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The west is Doolin’s back garden. Before that, Du Lin did not come back and was busy in other places. As a result, the conflict directly brought Duolin back to the west. This means that Doolin is going to intervene. Many people have not realized the terrible things of Doolin, but the teenager thinks that Doolin will be an important turning point in this conflict because he is too rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
