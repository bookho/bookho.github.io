			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 7 o'clock in the evening, the Hua Deng was on the top, although it was a remote small town of Tener, it was also decorated with lights, revealing the beauty different from the daytime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dillow and other descendants are looming on the street, don't have a taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golden Crystal Bar is located on the 14th Street in the city of Tener, near the north side of the city's Dongcheng District, on the outskirts of the core city circle. The Golden Crystal Bar is a medium-sized bar. It has a special designer and construction team. The style is not bad. The security of this bar is well-known and safe. It has attracted a group of middle-class people to spend their time here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of Golden Crystal is said to have been a big boss of a gang, and was later arrested and imprisoned for certain things. After serving the sentence, he did not return to the gang, but used his savings to open a bar like this. This bar is on the site of his former gang. With his old connections and status, no one dares to proactively cause trouble here. At the same time, if other gangs need to negotiate or trade, they will often use Golden Crystal as a place to negotiate transactions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, the Golden Crystal Bar became the most special bar in the city of Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first floor is an ordinary guest, the second floor often has gangs gathered here, the owner of the Golden Crystal has become a famous middleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is information about Golden Crystal, or Buddha tells Du Lin. When he was in prison, he met with many gangs. He met many people, but he did not join any gang. On the one hand, the populist atmosphere in the gang is even stronger. The Ogden people are more contemptuous and contemptuous of other failed races. They are not willing to let the Guarts "pollute" their gangs. On the other hand, some gangs who have invited the Buddha to do so are not looking for the future of the Buddha, but hope that the Buddha can be a sharp knife in their hands and help them to do dangerous things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Buddha will definitely not agree, even if he is forced to embark on this road in the future, he also hopes to join a gang of gualts. For example, the township association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the Buddha, the fellowship is a gang, but this gang knows more about how to hide his minions than other gangs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling took Graf and Dudu to the appointment, and the three entered the Golden Crystal Bar. When the people standing at the door saw Du Lin and Dudu, they blocked it. According to imperial law, minors under the age of 16 were forbidden to enter the bar. Although this law has been trampled by the owners of the bar countless times, although almost every bar can see some girls under the age of 16 in the pursuit of excitement, sometimes the surface work has to be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not welcome here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not speak, looking to stop himself Guy, Graf came up from behind and pushed the guy's arm open. The man took a step back and hid it behind him. "What's blocking? Didn't you see this is our president?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who prepared to pick up something, squinted and pulled his hand out again. "So small president? Hehe...you guys are enough!" He shook his shoulders and sorted out his clothes. "Go in, remember, don't make trouble, or no one can save you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked Look at him, the guy is looking straight ahead, just like not knowing that Du Lin is watching himself. Du Lin smiled and shook his head to regain his gaze and walked straight toward the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of the bar is very relaxed, the blue light illuminates everything in the bar, and it doesn't look dazzling, there is a special atmosphere. Turning left into the door is the stairs. After the three people climbed the stairs, they saw four people standing on the stairs in front of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them carefully examined the three people who went upstairs and showed a little smile on their faces. "You must be a fellow countryman? Rees is here, just waiting for you. Trouble you to hand over the weapons, this is to protect your safety, I hope you can understand. When you leave, things will be returned to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why many people are willing to use this as a place for trading or negotiating. Golden Crystal’s boss can protect the security of both parties, and people are willing to trade here. And negotiations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf gave the dagger he carried to the guy and stood aside, and he took out a knife that was only about 10 cm from his pocket. Also handed in. After some searching, the three talents were able to walk together. Although being searched for is not a pleasant thing, Du Lin can understand and be interested in the owner of this golden crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, he and Morris negotiated to pay 50 yuan, which is divided according to the amount of participation, which means that Du Lin needs to pay twenty-five dollars. This money is not too much, all the gangs can afford it, as long as he can guarantee security, twenty-five dollars for twenty-five dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of the staff, they came to the third room, and the staff waited for about half a minute after knocking on the door before opening the door and standing Outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stepped in step by step and saw the guy described by Dufo, the guy with the oily face. Today's Morris is wearing a purple suit and white leather shoes. It seems to be still makeup. He sat on the sofa and curled his legs on the coffee table. When Du Lin came in, he didn't have the desire to get up. He sat on the big thorn and looked at Du Lin. There are also two people around him, the body is very strong, the wrists bare outside the cuffs are covered with tattoos, and one of them has an obvious scar on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Du Lin?", Morris smiled, very rudely looking up and down Du Lin, a look of disdain, "I just said Want to talk to me? I don't want to talk, you give up the land, there is nothing for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sofa in the room is very long, like a horizontal C, Du Lin sat on the opposite side of Morris, tilted his legs, folded his hands and fingers together, and placed them on his knees. He also looked at Morris, and he was as if he had not heard it in the face of Morris's arrogance. There was a time of about ten seconds, and Du Lin said: "Huen has sold his farm to me, and has also been registered and licensed by the Imperial Land Use Office. I am legally and legally owning the land, so I No need to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The opposite should be Mr. Morris, your debt dispute with Huon is yours and should not involve my private On the property. For what happened during the day, I can offend you as if you didn't know, and I forgive you. I hope that I will not see you and your people near my ranch in the future." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris snorted after listening, and then he laughed. He pointed to Doolin and turned to ask the followers. "Have you heard? Do you hear?" My God, a child actually threatened me? Hahaha..." The laughter didn’t last long and stopped. Morris took back his legs, pressed one arm on his thigh and leaned forward. "I don't care." Do you have any deals in it, I only Dao Huen treats the land as if it is a debt to me. Do you want that ranch? No problem, take one thousand six hundred, and bring the money, I promise not to appear in front of you again." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
