			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin handed the pistol to the Buddha, he opened the door and looked out, the corridor was empty, indicating that immediately after leaving, a few people carrying half a person The tall backpack left the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the upper level, the couple who were on the sofa were stunned and watched a group of policemen crowding the room, and the two slowly raised their hands. Except for shame, nothing is left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police who led the team were a bit embarrassed. He picked up the wanted order in his hand and compared the man on the sofa. It was not a look at all. Du Lin’s appearance is almost recorded in his mind. The top of the federal government has been motivated internally. Who can “catch” Doolin, and in addition to the huge cash rewards, immediately promotes and enjoys a higher level of welfare. treatment. Not to mention the police, even the agents of the FBI have deeply engraved the appearance of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this guy in front..., the fat on the belly and the greasy face, the bald head and Du Lin are not at all like it. He hesitated a moment and showed the wanted order. "Have you seen this person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked carefully and nodded. "I see After this young man, he said that he didn't like this layer, and I changed the room..." In fact, he still has some not to say that this is a business suite, bigger, more spacious, and enjoy more things. For example, free lunch and dinner, and a free dry cleaning and hotel business car transfer. His own reservation is just an ordinary business room, no matter the grade or treatment is far less than this suite, and the young man also gave him two hundred dollars, counted as a gift for the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police responsible for the team snorted and asked the room number after the exchange, the police officers in the room immediately rushed out of the room and waited for them to run to the corridor. The middle of the room went down the stairs to the next level, and the room was empty. There were some things in the empty room that had not been able to be disposed of. The cigarette butts in the ashtray slowly rose into a blue smog, indicating that Du Lin and his party had just left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since a tramp ran to the police station and said that he saw Doolin, the police chief did not alarm other people, and he intended to put the credit into his pocket. In the same place, the police officers were sent directly to arrest the people. I didn’t expect Du Lin to run! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheriff arranged the police officer to go downstairs and picked up the phone to inform the police officers in the hall, paying close attention to the suspicious people, Du Lin may have already taken The elevator went down to the lobby and asked to temporarily block all the exits of the hotel, guarding against it and not letting Du Lin have the opportunity to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a waiter dressed in a garbage truck came out from the back door of the hotel. The policeman who watched the door looked at the young man carefully. One of them asked, "What is on your clothes?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man looked down and looked at the white chest and the burgundy uniform. There were two red dots on his chest. His face suddenly showed a surprised expression, followed by It became annoyed. "I have been very careful about the overdue ketchup. I didn't expect it to splash up..." He opened the lid of the trash can on the garbage truck, and a strong sweet and sour taste came over. The large bucket of red ketchup makes this trash can more like a commode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two police officers looked at the young man carefully and let the space open. They watched the young man push the garbage truck and went to the hotel to dispose of the waste. The garbage station of the object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than three minutes, the young man has changed and has appeared in the hotel’s underground parking lot. He is driving a mid-range car that is sold off because of the bankruptcy of the seller. Slowly parked at the door of the hotel, the police who stayed outside the hotel came over to check the social security number of the young man, and compared the photos on the wanted order to confirm that this guy was not Du Lin, they asked the young people to leave as soon as possible. After that, I paid attention to the interior of the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About five minutes or so, a waiter came over with a luggage cart, a large box on the luggage cart, and a backpack The young man took the initiative to get off the bus and the waiter put the suitcase and bag into the car, gave a tip of two dollars, and drove away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the car drove out of the city, he found a remote bridge and stopped. The young man went to the trunk and opened the box. Du Lin got out of it. . He moved his limbs and complained. "I almost didn't suffocate me. You should release me earlier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha smiled and didn't talk, After getting into the car, the two began to drive south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police searched every floor of the hotel and did not see Du Lin. The police officer responsible for blocking the first floor also said that he had not seen Du Lin left. However, the girl at the front desk told the police that there was such a person to check in. The missing Doolin let the police in Saint-Louis fall into a state of arrogance. How could people be so gone? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police chief originally wanted to conceal the news, but the sudden release of a large number of police officers was simply unclear, plus some people and the FBI’s People have a certain relationship, and the news is quickly revealed. Not only did the local top management know that Du Lin appeared in Saint-Louis, even Mr. Sail knew this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
