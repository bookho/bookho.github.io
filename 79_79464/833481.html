			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. early in the morning, Dewell climbed up from the bed with a light hand, changed a set of clothes that passed yesterday, and left home with a light hand. Locked the door. As a Guart who lives in Otis, he is not crowded out by society as the relatives in other places say. He is not very clear about how this exclusion has occurred, or even whether it really exists, or the exaggeration of relatives is uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in the city of Otis, he has not encountered such a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no lower-town area for the Guarts to live in, and there is no upper-town area for the Ogilde people to live in, all the people in the city are mixed. Live together. It may be because of poverty, so there is no question of whoever looks down on each other. Of course, it is also possible that because of the lack of competition, the slow pace of life in the whole city wants to sleep, except for those who sit at the door of the house and manipulate the sewing machine in the hands of the sewing machine. The rest of the work is the field. Those work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take care of the wheat seedlings, pour some water every day, and occasionally drain the fertilizer from the belly to add a little bit of soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calm and peaceful life makes people unable to find reasons and excuses for mutual hostility, so here everyone's status is similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diver remembered the young man he met yesterday, saying that he built a Guar church near the center of the city, serving the first king and The gods, any guart who can get some food and clothes there for free, make him very tempted. I can get up so early today, but also to see it earlier, maybe I can really get something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He crossed the street and greeted the acquaintances around him, and walked for about ten minutes, finally coming to the kingdom Outside the church. At this time, a lot of people had lined up outside the door. He even saw a few Oging people who were not Guarts waiting in line. He didn't say anything about it, but he walked quietly to the end of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know? I heard that they distribute food and other things every week, maybe some eggs, maybe some clothes or furniture, I really don't know them. What is it for?" The two people standing in front of Deville are chatting about it. He feels a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church also came here to develop believers, but unfortunately they only insisted for a year, then left the place, even removed the church, and carried the sculptures and stained glass inside. It is said that they said that the believers here are greedy, they only want to ask, there is no dedication, and one of the bishops also said that this place is not to be watched by God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long can this group of people and their fellow villagers persist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this question, Dewell walked into the church with ten pounds of wheat and a new dress. The church is in order, although the statues of the prophets and the gods that they promoted have not yet stood up, but there are already some paintings on the walls, which can make up for these problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man stood on the stage, he was frowning at something, and Dewell chose to sit down near where he came. And greeted the acquaintances around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the people in the church were almost full, the door closed and the young man raised his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very young and looks like a big man. The conversation in the church gradually subsided, and the eyes of the big guys were concentrated on the young man, trying to see what he was going to say. After all, everyone has taken a lot of his things. If you save a little bit of wheat, you can make the family survive for three or five days, or even longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for clothes, there is no need for everyone. Most people walking on the streets wear old clothes. Compared with these clothes, Deville feels a little. Cloth may be more appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are watching Du Lin, Du Lin is also watching these people, he is now a little helpless, because he does not know what to say. The social atmosphere of Otis is very good, everyone is very friendly, and there is no obvious class and hierarchy. This has led to the local assimilation of the Guars far more than other places. Here they felt the realism of politicians propagating "all are imperial citizens" and made Du Lin feel a little troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a person lives in a society without obvious racial conflicts and class conflicts, there is no dissatisfaction with his own situation, and it is necessary to unite these people. Very difficult. In the world of his dreams, there is a saying called "no desire is just". The popular point is that I don't want to get anything from you, so I am not afraid of losing something I didn't have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed and closed some information. He looked at the people in the church and snorted and found a way of thinking - dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello everyone, I am Du Lin, and the newly appointed mayor. Like everyone in the room, I am also a Guar!" Ordinary opening remarks, applause is not very enthusiastic, he casually pointed to a person, asked: "What is your dream?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diver is a little surprised When he thought about it for a while, he said with a sigh of relief: "I am very sorry, sir, I don't know what I have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin has a kind of What is the meaning of wanting a slap in the face of the impulse, even if the ideal is not alive? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled. "This shows that you are very satisfied with your current life. I think it is also the current accepted view of everyone, is it?", no A few people nod their heads and have a hand-worked subsidy for the family, which adults and children can do. Eating and drinking to go to the city to open a little wasteland, you can meet the family's demand for food and drink, they really have nothing to hope for. Du Lin walked back to the stage and he knew what to say next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a roll of money from his pocket in front of everyone, even though he didn’t like to roll up the money, but cash was all The Buddha is helping him to keep it. The guy likes to roll up the money and then wrap it in cowhide. It is very troublesome to put it in one roll. Especially in the pocket will bulge, affecting the appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he has not noticed those things. The circle in his pocket is twenty, and it is also the main circulation of the upper class. He took out one of them, then took out the lighter and lit the one. In the people’s exclamations and arguments, the banknotes finally became ashes after a minute of persistence, and Du Lin stepped on it. Then, Du Lin took out a twenty-dollar denomination of banknotes, showed them in front of everyone, and then lit a lighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is twenty dollars! You know that they don't necessarily have this money for a month, so they are burned like this? Many people are still unable to sit still, can burn the money, then why not give it to me? An Ogden stood up and he licked his lips. "Mr. Mayor, if you intend to burn the banknote in your hand, don't you know if you can give it to me?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the arrangement that Du Lin arranged. He thought that he might have to burn a few more bills before someone would stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head with a smile, continued to ignite the banknotes in his hand, and watched the banknotes become ashes in the exclamation of people, and I took another one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the first two were burned, everyone was just a little surprised, then it’s shocking now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Mayor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at him and shook his head, "You Wrong, and there are two points. First, when I was standing here today, I was not the mayor, but the Guar dulin. The second point, you are not a Guar but involved in Guar. The special gathering is a very rude thing in itself." When he finished, Kea went to his side and smiled at him and pointed to the small door that he left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy was a little embarrassed to hold his own bag and clothes, and some unwilling to leave the church under the supervision of Kina, and please go There are other Ogildins who come in to take advantage of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the previous Guar and pointed to him and asked: "Do you have the same idea as the gentleman just now, I put If the money burns, is it better to give it to someone else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwell stood up again and nodded again and again, "Yes, you lost it, why not use it? Help some people who need help?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin replied with a smile: “Because this is my money!”, he waits for others to think about this. When the meaning behind the sentence is expressed, a roll of money is directly spread out and all ignited. Ninety-eight, two thousand and fourty, in the process of people's shock to even the loss of language skills, has become a ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clap his hands and smiled and said: "Because this is my money, I have the power to choose their destination, whether it is for a certain person or burn It’s up to me to make a decision!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I can give this money to one of you, or you can give it to all of you. But why should I do this?” Du Lin left the podium and walked to the side of the stage. His eyes were swept away on the faces of those who had just returned. “Because what? Who can answer? I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
