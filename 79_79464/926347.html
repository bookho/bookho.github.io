			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur is a good man, and in public opinion he helped Du Lin cover the shocking tragedy that took place in Nano Lindes because he stood up and was in the police The Director of the Bureau, the Chief of the Police Investigation Bureau and the Lifelong Justice in front of him accused his father, Mr. John George, of getting at least a few percent from the hundreds of newspapers at a very low price. The fifteenth share, and for this Mr. John only paid a hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr. John can buy a 15% stake in a newspaper with a hundred pieces, the total value of these newspapers will not exceed one. Thousands, unless he can prove to the Ministry of Justice and all the public that he is not worth a thousand when he is a shareholder in these newspapers, he can elute some of his crimes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he can't do it, even if he can do it, no one will let him do it. In an instant, almost all newspapers reported news about Arthur. This is a spontaneous behavior of the newspaper. No one greets them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time people are discussing this and discussing Arthur as an upright person - he took the initiative to stand up and testify against the crimes committed by his father. Let the judicial process leap directly into a big step. Those who are as heavyweight as Arthur and involved in internal transactions become key witnesses. I am afraid that even if John is invited to Kevin, it is difficult to completely embark on his crimes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or he is a despicable person - after all, Mr. John is his biological father, but he stood up from behind when John needed the most help. Mr. John has a knife, from the universal values ​​and people's emotional aspects, Arthur is doing too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why people are willing to pay attention to this news and some of the things behind it, there are many reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The George family itself is a legendary industry trust, with a very strong reputation in the empire, especially the middle class, all successful people are The George family is one of their goals and pursuits. The struggle of the big family is often one of the favorite news of these middle classes. They may talk about some changes in stock prices, and they may also talk about possible opportunities and career disasters. The cause of this is big. Family scandal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a "high-profile" moment, Arthur personally came to the Imperial First Prison and sat in a separate room with Mr. John. There are cameras and recorders in the room. These devices are not powered and are mounted on the ceiling of the four corners as if they were placed. There are no prison guards in the room, only two of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Arthur asked. He told the Ministry of Justice that he would try to convince Mr. John to plead guilty, but they could not eavesdrop on what they said and they could not stay behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, the Ministry of Justice discussed it and agreed to Arthur’s request and signed the agreement. If he can convince John to plead guilty, it is enough to maximize the credibility of the Ministry of Justice in the empire and add more weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formulation of the law is an easy task. Several people can get a rule by sitting with their heads, but how to implement it is true. Problems and difficulties. When Magus privately ventilated in the Imperial Parliament through the "Illegal Manipulation of the Industry Act," this is the first shot for this bill, can only succeed, can not fail. In order to let more people realize the fairness and seriousness of the law, and the supreme majesty of God's law, if John can plead guilty, it is obviously the best ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air in the room was a bit dull, and Arthur suddenly sighed and fiddled with the cufflinks on his sleeve. He didn't look up at John, he didn't dare, just didn't want to. "I think, you must know what I did that day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John’s face is full of sorrow It seems that even what Arthur said is not understood. "What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?", Arthur’s tone rose somewhat. He shook his head. "Do you really forget it? Then... No, you are lying to me. Actually, the two of us are really strange to each other. You have cheated me once. Now I almost cheated me for the second time. I don't know anything about you. Are you really my father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. John remained silent and did not say a word. How could he forget that Arthur walked into his ward and hugged his arm that day, he really had a moment to think that Arthur finally understood what is family, what is family, what is family. However, Arthur’s next move made him angry and almost disguised as a failure. The bastard actually caught the ventilator tube he used to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can feel that the air in the mask is not circulating for a moment, if he is not pretending to be unconscious, maybe he will be Arthur that day. God did not know how to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he won’t say it now, he didn’t even tell Mark, now the George family is facing a huge crisis, at this time any internal consumption and infighting It is forbidden to exist. His opponents will certainly use such things to control Arthur and achieve their sinister despicable purpose. Only when everything is over will he say it, then deprive Arthur of his inheritance and drive him out of the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he must continue to play, just as if nothing has happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows his youngest son too much. He applied all of Mark’s shackles to Arthur’s body and gave him the best of everything. If you want something, give him something, but ignore the evil consequences of arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur has always been like a child who has not grown up. When he has a strong desire to get something but can’t get it, the emotion is There will be a loss of control. The relationship between them is precisely because Arthur wants, and he does not give it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was silent again. After a moment, Arthur looked at John. In this short time, he accumulated enough emotions. So that he no longer fears facing John. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mark is dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very short sentence with only two words, John The gentleman stood up fiercely, his hands pressed on the table, and the blue veins next to the temples swelled, making him look a little bit stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say? Say it again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur said calmly: "Mark died After dying from a robbery, the robber pierced his heart with a dagger. When the ambulance arrived at the scene, he was already dead and could not die any more.", could not help but an impulse, Arthur from the pocket I took out a pack of cigarettes and ordered one. I took a breath and slowly spit it out. I couldn’t help but say, "Hey, after a round, we are back to the starting point!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence seems a bit puzzling, said Mr. John told Arthur four years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Mr. John was disappointed with Arthur, and because Arthur wanted more money, he was not satisfied, so he and John’s brothers and sisters They colluded together and tried to get money from the public account for squandering. After this matter was known to Mr. John, he asked Arthur to go to his study and talk to him once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s definitely not a pleasant conversation for the father and son. Arthur used his poor negotiation skills to hope that Mr. John would understand that everything he did was for the family, and everything worked for the cause of the family. Arthur couldn't convince Mr. John. In the end, he said something out of control. He told Mr. John that he was the heir to the George family. These things were all hiss. He just wanted to manage it in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John first gave some of the industry to the management of Arthur in dishearteningness. In the end, he told Arthur, "Hey, after a round, we returned to the starting point!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are just a thief who can never satisfy his or her desire to steal money from his father's pocket!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You can get out of your money!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that incident, Mr. John recalled Mark and had high hopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. John’s brow, he apparently recalled the conversation, his cold face, humiliating with indifference to almost ruthless tone. Jose, his son. Then he took him out of the house like a shackle and told him that nothing was allowed to come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this sentence is used on your own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was caught in the sorrowful heart of the eldest son, suddenly burst into a flash of lightning, the expression on his face was more distorted, fiercely rushed Arthur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur scared back and almost lost his balance and overwhelmed the chair. He stepped on the ground and stabilized his center of gravity, only to realize that even if Mr. John had a long arm, he could not touch him across the entire table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He limited his shame and sorted out his tie, then looked at Mr. John with a brow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's you, are you doing it? You arranged Mark's death!", Mr. John snorted in a low voice, and some of his mouth spread. The white spit, he waved his fist in anger, like a monster who chose to succumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur’s eyes flashed a chill that couldn’t tell the truth. He snorted. “This is awkward, father!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is more tragic than the old ones, especially as he looks at Mark’s rapid growth and grows to the point where he can support the family and support the family. Even if the George family can't resist this time, the connections and wealth that he has run in these years are enough to make the George family fade out of sight and re-emerge. But all this has been ruined by this bastard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
