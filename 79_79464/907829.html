			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice was quickly arrested and explained everything she knew. As a journalist, even an independent journalist, the political sense of smell More sensitive than ordinary people. She quickly realized the seriousness of the case. When she thought of the reports she had reported before, her peers reported a confession, and she almost lost her incontinence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After asking for a toilet, her mood stabilized and she explained everything she knew. Then from the film she found in her camera, there were many clues, one of which was the most crucial - there were four people sitting in the car, two of whom had a clearer face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin knew that the news immediately blocked Hite from the source of the message, and then kept the film properly, so that everyone could close their mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly realized that when Magus knew his son’s psychological dynamics when he was killed in a car accident and died on the side of the road, things have already happened. And it is irreparable, so what you need to do now is to use your own "victim" status to maximize your next benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has nothing to do with ruthlessness or sentimentality, but the inevitable result of calm thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he is going to the East Coast, and since the other party has already made a move, he has to force the other side out. Want to stand in the middle of the shadows and harvest season? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First ask the bullet in the bomber to answer it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Doolin went to the East Coast, Soro had returned to the territory of the Northern family. Yes, it is the territory. They used the money to buy the ownership of their own territory, not including a town and two villages, and became the largest landowner on this land. Therefore, there is no problem in the family territory. Those in the town and in the village still refer to the people of the Cape family as nobles. They also lived as respected as people have in the past, and there is no open and advanced in the South. Atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is this way for you to get what we need?", the owner of the Cape family sits in a chair, the doctor around With a low waist and a low head, he told him to restrain his anger and not to get angry. This is not good for his health. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man waved his hand and did not follow the doctor's arrangement. Although his eyes were already muddy, the eyes in his eyes couldn't be sullen, but he gave a sharpness that he could not look straight. He stared at Soro. In his sight, Solo was blurry. The doctor prepared his eyes for him, but he didn't like that thing. That thing made him look more like an "old thing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All ambitious people will not accept the old, he does not accept, he is only a little tired and the body is not too good, so I want to retire, Absolutely not because of his age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo’s face, standing next to him and holding his back like a maid’s grandson stood up, “Homeowner, this is my personal decision. "It has nothing to do with Mr. Soro." He bit his teeth, otherwise he could hear the sound of his upper and lower rows of teeth slamming. He is really scared, but there is no way to stand up. If he says that Soro is telling him to do this, Solo may be unlucky and he may disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he keeps silence, the last whip will definitely not fall on him. After all, Solo is the principal, but he is destined to be kicked in. In the pit, there is no chance to turn over. There is no courage to take the place of the owner, who dares to use you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if he takes the initiative to stand up and say that everything is his unspoken decision with Solo, Solo is unaware of it and he will be severely punished. . But he won't disappear, and he will leave a very good impression on Solo, which is equivalent to using it to clamp down Solo. In the future, when Soro gains momentum, if he does not give him better treatment and position, people will question Solo's character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of nobility, character is a very important thing, especially a big person, if you don’t have a good character, if you don’t know how to be grateful, People will be willing to serve his heart and soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner sneered a sneer, and he knew it well, but when Soro’s grandson could take the initiative, he would have to turn around. Room for it. It’s really not time to hand over Solo’s grandson, even if Du Lin doesn’t care, he doesn’t dare to kill the Cape family. Then he drove the grandson out of the family, and the storm of the matter subsided, and he was quietly coming back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles always take care of the face of life, for their own decent, they have many small means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the reprimand is still to be reprimanded. Otherwise, this will open a very bad head for others. "Let the butler take him to implement the family rules...", the owner took a hand and immediately there was someone outside the door. Come in and put the grandson out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family rules are very strict, the more the family is stricter in the "penalty", the big family like the Cape family, not many people can be in the family rules Under the full support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the room door was closed again, the owner sighed. "You are too bold this time, maybe those outside have always called you a nobleman." Master, let you forget that the current empire is no longer an empire, and we are not aristocrats.", Solo bowed his head and expressed respect for his family, and his humbly accepting criticism, the family shook his head, "kill The consequences of a mayor-level official are too serious, and now these mayors are like past governors, like past territorial nobles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should be glad that it is only a farmer's child. If there is enough power behind him, your behavior means that you will provoke a war between the two nobles. Thousands of people will give their lives because of your actions. And it’s all because you want this chair under me. Is power really important?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo didn’t look up, so the owner I can't see the expression on his face, if that chair is not To, if the chair represents power is not important, then why do not you give me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words will not be said in the heart, and he will not accept all the criticisms of the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he thinks the owner has a saying that is right, it is just a farmer’s child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner also realized that he couldn’t manage these people. The whole family entered the state of excitement for the alternation of power. His attitude was not as good as before. Received the attention of family members. He just sighed, and the palm of his hand subconsciously rubbed on the pure gold deputy of the chair. "The road is your own choice. You must have the courage to bear all the consequences. Go out and do what you want." Don't let me get an old bone from the bed in the middle of the night, I want to live a few more days!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the home side, Solo The face was very gloomy, and now the new party’s high-level side and the spearheads in the family point to him, which makes him realize that his good nephews have promoted this matter, the purpose is to let him completely lose the opportunity. At the same time, he also realized that Du Lin was a trouble. Without this person, there would not be so many things. He made a decision faintly in his heart. Some things really should be changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Du Lin finally came to Porteux, one of the three pearls on the East Coast. The port with the largest empire throughput, the gang members who claimed to be responsible for the matter, were detained here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin and his entourage went directly to the police station. Those people were in the police station. The director of the police station heard that Du Lin came and immediately greeted him. When he was just about to talk to Du Lin about the case, a very handsome young man reached out and pressed his chest and pushed him back. The police chief was just preparing to attack, but his gaze greeted the young man's cold eyes as cold as the iceberg floating on the north side of the sea. His lips moved and he swallowed what he wanted to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the person?" Du Lin stood in the lobby of the police station and looked at the police station. "Put the person, I want Take them away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police chief just said this time, "Mr. Doolin, are you going to take them?", he said, shaking his head "The state doesn't allow me to do this. They only allow you to review them here, or even teach them a meal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not say anything, station A young man standing behind Du Lin stood up. He took a military officer’s card from his jacket pocket and handed it to the police chief, and said in a very harsh tone: “I am from the Irian’s naval base. Colonel Thomas, I suspect that these people are involved in a crime that is related to the military. Now they have to take them to investigate. If you refuse to hand over these people, I have the power to force them away!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police chief looked at the door at this time, four military transport vehicles outside the door, Teams of soldiers sitting on a gun truck. He snorted, and suddenly he had a thick sweat on his forehead, while holding a handkerchief and rubbing the sweat on his head, he thought about how to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the young man who only used his eyes to make him feel the fear, grabbed his collar with one hand and lifted him slightly, like laughing and laughing. Asked: "This is East Coast, sir. Do you want to violate Mr. Doolin's will?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the frenzied surge from the eyes of this young man The killing of the police, the police chief suddenly thought that Du Lin was not only the mayor of the mainland, but also the well-deserved emperor of the East Coast underground world... He snorted again, pointing to the police officers who were stunned and motionless, shouting loudly: "Bring up the free frontline people." After he said that he was holding a smile and gently patted the Buddha. hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
