			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The governor told me that the people of the central bank also came to the west and asked me to receive them." At the table, Julio spoke to the governor who gave him yesterday. He greeted him and told him that the imperial central bank came to the west in order to solve the problems left by the three-guarantee policy. It is said that it was the cabinet that made the imperial central bank act, so it was necessary to do a good job of reception. But I don't know why, Julio heard some unfriendly things from the governor's tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like telling him again, don’t give the Empire’s central bank a face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each state has a large degree of autonomy, except that it must adhere to the principle of an empire, the position is unwavering, and only need to abide by the Imperial Basic Law, recognize Royal family. As for other things, they can be implemented through negotiation or choose not to implement the cabinet resolution. Therefore, even if the imperialist central bank obtains the documents of the cabinet, the state government can also refuse the imperial central bank to implement the cabinet resolution on the grounds of “not suitable for the basic situation of the locality”. This is the freedom of the state government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This management system is an old system left over from the aristocratic era. During the feudal dynasty, each nobleman had his own territory on their fiefdom. They are the well-deserved emperors. People only recognize the rule of the nobility. They are not concerned about the rule of the royal family. They are only loyal to the aristocrats on the fief, claiming to be the people of the aristocracy, not the people of the royal family. In order to prevent the aristocracy from over-expansion leading to the civil war, the royal family established a new position, the Governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor is equivalent to the current governor, but it is different. The Governor only has military power sufficient to suppress the place, but has no right to question the construction of the aristocratic territory. The appearance of the Governor means that the royal family has no trust in the place, so it has such a role more like a "command" to stay in the place. However, with the enthusiasm of the Governors for their power, they motivated them to take the first step in intervening in local politics without the permission of the royal family or the acquiescence of the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a horrible rebellion against several neighboring governors, involving more than a dozen aristocrats of varying sizes, and then sending these nobles The gallows began the long period of the Governor’s military and political power. However, it is a pity that the royal family began to distrust the Governor. He believed that the Governor’s power exceeded the red line. Therefore, he deprived the Governor of his military power and changed the local military region attached to the Central Government to balance the power of the Governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocracy, the governor, and the royal family have been fighting for hundreds of years and finally being overthrown by a guy named Magus, ushered in a new era, but some things have not changed, just changed a new skin. Therefore, some people will say that the nobility is still aristocratic, just saying that it is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of local autonomy has been restrained to a certain extent, but it is still quite free. If the governor does not want the imperial central bank to come in, the imperial central bank will really enter. Not coming. Of course, this will happen only in the case of both sides. Once the imperialist central bank begins to use his terrible network, even if the governor does not want to agree, he must finally agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belitto is not surprised that the central bank will intervene. Two of the senior executives of the Southern Commercial Bank also hold high-level positions in the Imperial Central Bank. Lito has long known that the level of solidarity of the top executives of the Southern Commercial Bank is even more terrible than the outside world imagined. It is necessary to know that these bankers were almost forced to commit suicide by being forced to collapse in bankruptcy by the imperial central bank. Therefore, even if they develop to this day, they will remain vigilant against the central bank and hate them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he certainly can’t imagine that the imperialist’s delegation’s delegation just came to the west and offended one of the highest executives here. After all, the cooperation between the imperial official and the central bank has always been Not bad, I have never heard of any contradictions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belito put down the knife and fork and lowered the voice, saying, "The central bank’s top management is very arrogant, in the eyes of those of them, apart from the bankers. There are only two groups of consortia and the poor, and even government officials are placed in the category of the poor. Last year at the central bank’s high-level annual meeting, a central bank’s chairman said that the empire’s 60% of the wealth is in the central bank. In the treasury, after the words came out, they were very passive, but they also reflected their arrogance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If those people give you a look, You can contact me, I will accompany you to attend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellito’s idea is actually Julio’s guess, now everyone does not know the governor and the central bank. How about those people talking about it, as another contender in this matter, Perito definitely wants to know more about the real situation of things. He seems to want to support the scenes for Julio. In fact, he also has the idea of ​​inquiring about the inside story. At the same time, he gives the central bank a feeling that he has almost negotiated and there is nothing wrong with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for Julito’s statement, Julio still appreciates, they have been working together in the South for a long time, can be said to be very good friends. The promotion and implementation of any policy is inseparable from economic support. It is precisely because of Perito that Julio is capable of doing things in the South and has received a ticket to the governor. Moreover, he also intends to continue this model. Compared with the developed cities in the south, where the economy is more developed and more open-minded, if the concept of western old-fashionedness cannot be broken, it will be difficult to usher in tremendous development. Tickets are worthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only by promoting a policy and insured person left by a three-guarantee policy, a southern commercial banker headed by a Baileyto can persuade Perito to continue to support his career in the west, while also allowing Perito to have a stay. The reason for the west is the insurance business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friendship is never as strong as the benefits, this is Julio’s experience! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not worry, my friend, when we go to the central bank, I would like to see what they will look like when they see you." Julio, who has read some content from the governor’s phone, sold a favor. Anyway, it is impossible for him to suffer, and he can earn one. Why not? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belito clearly accepted this person's feelings, people live in the world, isn't it the alternation of the house? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, their topic shifted to the issue of the strike. It is expected that the strikes that were postponed until today will suddenly be misfiring, making them a bit confusing. Prior to this, Julio had asked the press officer to release a message saying that it would solve the problems left by the three guarantees as soon as possible, but this is only a best-effort behavior. No one would think that releasing a message would stop the strike. 's arrival Otherwise, the atmosphere in the place will not be so tense, but the strange thing is that the strike did not really start, but there was a feeling of shrinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are obviously ready to meet the big strike, but the big strike has not come, it is too frustrating, after all, many guidelines have been prepared, so many deaths have been made. Brain cells, punched in the air, make people feel a little uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you heard any recent noises? I think the suspension of the strike may be related to something we don’t know, if it’s not good news, that Can become even worse!", Julio is worried that these working classes will not see a practical solution, turning the strike into a big turmoil, if that is the case for him, for Vanlier, for the entire west Causing devastating effects. It can be expected that a large number of capitalists will withdraw from this unstable region, and the local economy will quickly decline, and a series of managers will be punished and even removed from their posts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belitto is also a doubt. He has been reading the information left by the Mennon for a while, and discussing the cake with the senior officials of the South Commercial Bank. The problem of eating and how to eat does not continue to pay attention to the problems related to the strike. Even in the course of their discussion, a director of the South Commercial Bank believed that the strike was a very favorable thing for them. Only when the strike broke out, they could show more value by reaching out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
