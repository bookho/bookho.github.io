			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you ever thought about going back to work?" Du Lin shook his glass and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natalie:???<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She regained her gaze and stared at the colorful The drink, "I actually had this idea when I just resigned, but as the bar opened up, the thoughts gradually faded." She turned to look at Doolin. "I found out now, so Life is what I want most."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sleep every day to wake up naturally, then go out shopping with friends, or sit here and sit at night Going home with three points of drunkenness, time flies very quickly and is particularly relaxing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled and raised the glass in Du Lin’s hand, hiding half The sentence - just a little empty... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No goal, no pursuit, no life to live without a destination, do not know why it is alive, such a day makes people embarrassed. Sometimes you will have the courage to do a career, but you will soon be courageously defeated by laziness or hesitation, and become a lazy look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Doolin, Natalie feels that he and the past few years have not changed anything, but more confident, that can attract women’s attention The temperament is also stronger, and people can't help but want to worship him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a moment of lost in the eyes, and soon becomes clear again. After all, it is no longer a little girl. If you like someone, you will do it and show your heart. She also knows that the marriage between Doolin and the Timamont family is just a bit stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say me, talk about you, how come back to Otis city suddenly, and today's newspaper did not say that you want to come back."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that Du Lin has become what he hopes, star politicians have become the focus of attention, and his words and deeds will appear in the form of words in the newspaper. It is the last toilet, and those newspapers will also pass his time in the toilet to guess what his physical fitness is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly put down the wine glass, hands on the bar, looked at the bottle of wine on the counter, smiled. "I just want to come back and see, after all, I am I stayed here for a while, always feeling a little bit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natalie was a little smoked, she took another sip of wine, one eyebrows, one hand On Doolin's shoulder, his lips were close to his ear and whispered, "Is it for the Seventh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at her sideways The more rosy cheeks, smiled and asked, "Guess what I think in my heart?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She laughs like the crisp sound of the wind chimes, three minutes of drunkenness The dyed cheeks were slightly red and hot, and in this bright light, a little more delicate, "I guess it is right, right!", Du Lin did not answer, just looked at her, she rose more and more proudly. The chin, revealing the white neck, drunk the wine in the cup. After a few seconds, he spit out a wine device and placed the cup on the bar. Under the eyes of her eyes, the bartender prepared a glass of wine for her. "Definitely, I guessed it!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. "Yes, you guessed it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natalie took another drink, alcohol Let the blood boil, and make her excited. She sat sideways, stretched her leg to the edge of Doolin, and got closer. Suddenly, "The heart of the people will change." "She seems to have a lot of emotions, and she drank some wine." So I saw you, I knew that you must come back for the Seventh, and definitely not for others...", she suddenly covered her mouth. I spit out some alcohol, some confused eyes looked at Doolin, and I reached out and touched his cheek. "You are a cold-blooded guy, we won't come back because of us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are drunk." Du Lin looked at her and saw that her movements were somewhat uncoordinated. She just drank so much wine and wine. Has started to affect her nerves, she drank too fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone has changed their mind..." Natalie made these words from his mouth as he drove to the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a drunken word, it can only be said to be sentimental. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
