			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 4 o'clock in the afternoon when Doolin was preparing to dine in advance, Scott came, not only did he come, he brought two people, one looked Very ordinary glasses, a stupid man, and a glamorous woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Du Lin often watches movies, she will know that this woman is currently a popular female star. She is called Celine. People don’t know her before. I know her through the movie, but three other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;body, gossip, topic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a body that many women will admire, in line with the majority of men's aesthetics, women with such a body will certainly have good luck. Then there was an interesting story in which she changed seventeen boyfriends in four years and attacked other public figures in the media. It wasn't until after someone had spent a lot of time on her in these two years that the things gradually disappeared and replaced by her characters and performances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to have dinner together?", Doolin shook hands with Scott, and he hadn’t seen this guy for a while, including this time. He did not pick him up with Howton. Du Lin took back his hand and took Scott into the erection hall. After the three people sat down, Du Lin looked at Scott. "Say, what are you looking for? I am very happy in the past." I will consider it at the discretion of the partnership."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott doesn't seem to care much about Dooling, he knows that Doolin is a very serious person. But sometimes people who are joking, "This is the way you accept old friends, it's too sad!" The atmosphere in the room is still lively and peaceful, and Scott's smile gradually converges after a few laughs. He introduced Du Lin to two of his guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is Mr. Monte, one of the top five film companies, the gold producer of Winter Flower. If you have watched the movie..., sorry, I remember that you don't watch movies. In short, Mr. Monte is very powerful. The eleven films he has produced have achieved great success. They are known as 'beacons' in the industry and can bring enough returns to investors. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monte took the initiative, he pushed the glasses frame, and Du Lin, who was bent over and stretched his hand to the coffee table, shook hands. "I am very glad to meet you. Mr. Doolin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling nodded, and Scott introduced the very special woman, Celine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been working in the City Hall, often on behalf of Hossington to reach out to people from all walks of life, and practiced a mouth that can speak, there is no foundation and The private life was a bit bad. Serin became a holy girl like a white lotus in Scott's mouth. Celine also took the initiative to shake hands with Du Lin, and then sat back with a very reserved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulindo glanced at the woman. When he just shook hands, he obviously felt the woman scratching his palm with his fingers, if not feeling wrong. This woman is suggesting to him that she is afraid of dirty things like ghosts. It is well known that actors like the heroine have single rooms, and she will be scared when night falls, so I hope someone can accompany her through the night of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the weather is not very good now, the snow is flying, if you can encourage each other to spend the night while still warming together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s a pity that Du Lin is also afraid of ghosts, so he basically does not go out at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylin didn’t get enough response, she was bitterly biting her lip, and she was very charming when she made this little trick, producer and Scott. In fact, they all saw it, but they did not see it as they did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Celine is more connotative than her. She knows Freina. The two have worked together in a movie, that is the kind of look. Like the background board, the protagonist's extraordinary and extraordinary folks are set off. She also knows the future of Freena. To be honest, having a young and wealthy person is also a good choice, at least better than the guy who is enough to be her father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's like this!", Scott draws everyone's attention to himself. "Mr. Monte is shooting a romantic love movie, with The City Hall also signed an agreement, and we will help them to the maximum of the problems and difficulties in filming. They need a beautiful building to support the romance in the movie, and your estate is obviously the most "The right place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Mr. Doolin.", Monte Brown's hair is a bit messy, he wears a brown red and white line today. Plaid coats, with a wide-brimmed eye, are like the unscrupulous professors in the college. He pushed the glasses frame and looked at Du Lin very sincerely. "When our movie is released, it is enough to bring you and your estate a great reputation. I believe this is what you want, and we will Pay a generous reward to thank you for your generosity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought for a moment and shook his head. "I don't need money, I don't want people to know me, so I am sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?", Monte There was a disappointing expression on his face. He liked the manor on the cliff by the sea. When he was photographed from the other side, the manor’s buildings were hidden in the greenery, and the deep blue sea set off this place. The noble and mysterious nature of the manor is in line with the mood in the script. However, he is also very clear about who Du Lin is. The refusal on the phone has allowed him to find Scott. Scott has also had a problem that has not been solved. That is, there is really no way to solve it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two quickly left, and Scott stayed. He sighed first, then smiled and said: "Ask a very presumptuous The question, if one day I am going to the city of Otis to trust you, will you take me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words made Du Lin a bit Confused, Scott has always been the most effective assistant to Hossington in his impressions. In some past occasions, Hossington told others in a suggestive tone, if he left Irian, then He will definitely nominate Scott to take over his position as mayor. Many people know his thoughts and feel that this is the best choice. After all, the highest probability in the whole city, and everyone is familiar with it is not the mayor of Hossington, but represents that he is outside every day. Scott running away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Scott’s understanding of Irian and the group of businessmen here, it would be a good news if he could become the mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now it seems that this is not the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott leaned back on the couch and stunned his face. "I know what you are saying, in fact, sometimes someone is too good. A good thing!" After he said that this sentence was obviously self-proclaimed, he laughed first. "Do you believe that Hossington actually intends to take me with him after successfully running for the governor, and this is what we said before. It’s totally different.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He lied to me!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Du Lin is I fully understand, in the final analysis, because of power. If the mayor and the governor’s secretary are simply divided into the party’s status, the two are actually similar. Many of the governor’s secretaries have become mayors or parliamentarians, and there are not many, but in terms of actual power, there are too many differences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary of the governor is always just a secretary. It is not the one who really makes decisions. Others regard you as one thing, but also on the face of the governor. If you encounter such an unambiguous official, what is the governor’s secretary? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor is different, the power is in the grip, the respect of a city, you can manage and build a city according to your own ideas and political ambitions. This is the secretary of the governor. Can it be done? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott has been doing so well over the years, so that Hossington is too comfortable, good things are difficult to do, he has done it all, let Hossington just sitting in the office to sign, or adjust the direction of the city's development, as for the other to teach Scott to complete. With such a powerful subordinate, Hawthorne is certainly not willing to let go, so he plans to take him to the state of Isenas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus his relationship with Doolin is not bad, there can be reconciled there to avoid conflicts between himself and Doolin, which makes Hors There are more reasons to bring Scott together to open the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were all Hossington’s own ideas, but he was a little uneasy after seeing Du Lin yesterday, and gave Harry a call to verify some things. Something that was not dead was heard by Scott, and in the past half year, Hossington did not continue to suggest that someone else Scott will take over, and immediately made Scott doubt. Then he was very clever to verify it - in a simple sense, it was loyal to the table. As a result, Hossington took it seriously and immediately told him that he would take him with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not Hussein’s stupidity. Two people have been together for six years, they are too familiar with each other, and the cooperation on weekdays is full of tacit understanding. Hossington did not think about this. It was Scott who was testing him, so he said something that should not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott felt that he was deceived by Scott’s psychological imbalance. He has tried his best to do things for Hossington in the past few years because Hossington has such personality. Charm is not something that has surpassed friendship between two people. It is purely that Scott wants to be a mayor and is power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now everything he has worked on has become a bubble, so he started to find his way for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not his best choice, but at the same time his best choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
