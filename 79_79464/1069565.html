			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At six o'clock, the opera actor mournfully squats on the chest with a dagger's heroine sitting on the floor, the curtain of the theater slowly descends and finally All the coverage, this whole opera ended here. Originally, Doolin didn't think of anything else. He actually listened to the person sitting behind and explained to his female companion that the curtain that was lowered was black, representing despair, meaning that the last desperation drowned everything, including the still-born actor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, Du Lin also found a very strange thing, sitting around him and the successful capitalists who ate people without bones, maybe there is Some others forced others to break, but at this moment they actually showed a sad look because of a tragic opera, and some women actually cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods bless, Du Lin also feels that the opera is very good, the actors are also very good, not only professional but also very tension. That is something he can't see in other opera troupes. He doesn't know how to describe it. It is the kind of actor standing there. Every action will make you think that he is the character, and he should be like this. The feeling of doing it, without a sense of abruptness, has a very strong sense of identity, making people feel that he is that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only pity is that the plot is too old-fashioned, he can't bring himself in, and he can't feel the thick sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tearful tears of Henry took out the handkerchief and rubbed the tears on his cheekbones. He twitched twice. "Too touching, too sad, I never felt To sadness will impact my heart like a river against the current, I want to find a place to cry a lot!", he turned to look at Doolin, "Why, why there is always a relationship between civilians and nobles Can't cross the gap, can such love not be touched by God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, because you are a former person, Du Lin Silently spurting in my heart, the love between the nobility and the civilians seems to always be the theme of tragedy, whether the male aristocrats fell in love with female civilians, or the female aristocrats fell in love with male civilians, and eventually they will die one day, sometimes Will die together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you not upset?", looking at Duolin, who was silent, Henry held his handkerchief and pinched his nose and licked his nose, then lost the handkerchief On the ground, "I found out for the first time that you are really cold-blooded!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pointed at her chest and widened her eyes. "I? Cold-blooded? My friend, I have been here for more than three hours to watch an opera I don't like. Then you said that I am cold-blooded? I am not You should cry out and you feel that I am a normal person? But in fact, that is not normal, all this is fake, just an opera, a performance."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But they did happen!" Henry rarely argued, and his attention quickly shifted away from the question of whether Dulin was a cold-blooded person. You said that if I asked the heroine to eat, how much would it cost to reflect my respect and respect for her?" Du Lin had to admire Henry’s ability to shift focus. Maybe the bastard is already thinking about it. Money sent the heroine to bed. "Two thousand should be almost the same. Her current market is about 20,000. What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin With a white eye, he didn’t even know where Henry was heard The actress price, perhaps this is his and Henry, and Kevin reason not to play together in some way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry raised his hand, and soon a theater waiter came over, holding a plate in his hand and a pen on the plate. And paper. Nowadays, many opera houses have such unspoken rules, or the whole industry has a bad atmosphere. The actors who are desperately trying to be famous are to sell themselves for a better price, and then use this money to make themselves more Status and fame, and then sell higher prices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the case at the Imperial Capital. At that time, Du Lin thought that this was only the characteristics of the Imperial Capital, but I did not expect it to be the same, then this is a question worthy of deep thought. And it has evolved into a social problem. Perhaps this has a direct relationship with the rapid changes of the times. Many people have not kept up with the pace of the times. Under the impact of tremendous power, they can only choose the most suitable way to adapt to this era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a cycle that never sees the head. Of course, this is what people call the fame circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Henry wrote the price he felt was right, he suddenly looked down at Doolin and asked, "Do you have any favorite actresses? We can go out for dinner together, just to the meal, my stomach is a little hungry.", Du Lin shook his head, he shrugged his shoulders, folded the paper, folded it back, put it back in the tray, and attached I took a tip of ten dollars. The waiter smiled and ran into the backstage with a tray, and the tip of ten dollars was enough for him to take the initiative to serve the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You guess I will be selected, maybe I should have three thousand more, so the odds are bigger." In the face of chattering Henry Doolin thinks he is annoying, he is willing to let the heroine kidnapped Henry’s bed didn’t want him to torture himself for this kind of thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the actors in the background chose very quickly, and Henry gave the face very much. He directly filled in a very high price of 30,000. The heroine knows how to make the best choice for himself than the tens of thousands of notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is also a way to reflect the value of the actors. This time the heroine accepted the invitation of Henry, and soon the news about the bidding will be passed on. Going out, there won't be Henry's name and other information, but there is a price to invite the heroine. Later, when others want to invite her again, how much will make their own judgments with reference to this price, and can also provide an accurate judgment for the heroine himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Henry’s behavior is very bad. He gave a premium of 50% over the market price he said. In the past, there were some people. I think that the price increase of the opera actress is too fast and has a direct relationship with those who push up the price. This makes some small rich people have not had time to make anything and find that the price has exceeded the range of their ability. This is a kind of Very annoying behavior. On the other hand, it is a matter of money for rich people to think about how to spend money. Who can't control it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two people when they came. When they were three, Du Lin wanted to reject Henry’s invitation to dinner, but this guy said that Du Lin and Du Lin and He used dinner together, and the three chose Verrier's local luxury, while featuring a restaurant as a place for dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the three were seated, Henry ordered dinner and then looked at the actress. "I am Henry, this is my good friend Du Lin." At the table, Henry introduced himself to the actress and Du Lin. He didn't introduce it. After him introduced it, the actress stared at Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I seem...you know, Mr. Doolin, the news is often reported in the newspaper." The actress was very enthusiastic, she thought it would be a dinner party today. I ate with some greasy middle-aged people. I didn't expect both of them to be good, especially the celebrities like Du Lin. The fame and celebrities are what she needs, or what all actors need. If a reporter can take a photo of her current meal with Du Lin, her worth will rise again tomorrow morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
