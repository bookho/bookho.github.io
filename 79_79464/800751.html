			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next night, Du Lin appeared on time in the restaurant, the restaurant is not a famous restaurant, but the style is elegant and the environment is quiet. Although the place is not big, it can only be placed under ten tables, but it is always full of queues. But this time, Du Lin didn't need to line up, and they couldn't see other people in the restaurant. He packed a three-hour period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that Du Lin’s stupidity is not willing to pack the whole night, but the owner of the restaurant disagrees. He moved some of his individual’s appointments to 8:30. For the first three hours, Du Lin’s, for which he had to pay a thousand yuan per hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was thinking about things, and Garfield’s laughter suddenly sounded outside the door. He immediately put away the scattered thoughts and stood up and greeted him. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Luke’s arrest, Garfield’s faint conscious has realized that this is the way Dulin did, because Du Lin’s performance at the time of his family’s talks with Luke Something is unusual. He is too simple to take a part of his mouth and give it to Luke. At the beginning, Garfield thought it might be that Doolin was a little afraid of Luke, including Luke himself. It was not until Luke was arrested that he discovered that it was a trap and Luke himself jumped on his own initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he can recognize this, Garfield made up his mind to try not to sin Dulin this guy if he was not necessary, in case he was taken by him one day. It’s never a pleasure to be pitted or hated by him. It happened that Du Lin had asked him to do his work. When he helped Du Lin, he also found a business for his friends. What are you doing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether they can talk about it, in the end they will not record him in the book of the heart, if it is said that this is human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can still do the business like this package. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Mr. Thomas!" Garfield introduced Du Lin to a middle-aged man wearing a casual dress on his left hand. He has a blond hair and a posture. Very tall and straight, the shoulders are slightly higher than the average person. Although he is laughing, he can't hide the unique atmosphere of the soldier under the surface of the impetuous. Garfield introduced Mr. Thomas to Mr. Doolin. "This is the famous 350,000 Mr. Irian, who can help me a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That piece of land Garfield has long been in the hands, but has never thought of what to build. The coastline of Irian is like a north-south crescent, embracing a part of the sea, the land in his hand, which is the manor that Dulin now lives on the tip of the crescent in the north. His original idea was to build an intensive business cluster that was a little far from the real commercial core of the Irian plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you build a landscape, you can make money, you can invest in it, it’s not going to be small, and it’s going to take longer to make money. In the end, he thought about deciding to build a luxury manor. The overall cost was between 180,000 and 200,000, plus the land sold for 366,000. After selling for half a year, they have not sold. First, the local rich have already had more than one villa. There are also manors outside the city. There is no need to spend 350,000 to buy a manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, everyone is more familiar, this price will definitely not be able to talk, and it will drag down for a while until Du Lin’s appearance, a cash withdrawal, let Field breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin and Mr. Thomas shook hands and said two scenes, and they led the two to sit on the best table in the restaurant - A building that protrudes from the main body of the building uses ten centimeters of thick glass as the ground. The whole person is like sitting in the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is the cliff and the sea. Occasionally, the waves are soaring and some waves are shot on the low-end glass, which makes people feel scared. But once you get used to it, you don’t have a taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time I asked Mr. Garfield to invite you to come. There is a business that I want to interview you. Please forgive me. I have to ship a lot of things. There are a lot of places to go. I don’t know if you have enough transportation capacity and enough boats.” Du Lin took out three metal cylinders and sent one to them. He kindly suggested: “From the provincial ya Wang Du's top collection of hyphae, try it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provincial king is the political core of the past Yawang Dynasty, after the demise of the Yaoxing Empire All the buildings that are related to the Imperial Palace of the province, the bustling city immediately became a ruin, and the provincial royal family was also beheaded here. I don't know if it is because of the wonderful things about the blood of these royal families. Soon, there are hyphae in the ruins. Now it has become the mainstay of the local economy. Every April, a collection is organized to collect these wild hyphae. , made a happy sale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This top class is about 120 yuan, which is the top quality! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garfield smiled and cut a bite, smiled and nodded, feeling unpleasantly happy, and after a while, his eyes recovered and clear," It’s really a good thing, it’s a waste.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas’s movements are more eye-catching than Garfield’s, and he also tastes a sip, the muscles on the gang After shaking, the tight facial muscles gradually relaxed a lot, and some smiles were revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blinked his eyes and placed one hand under the table. Du Lin wondered if he had twisted his thigh muscles. "So let's talk... His words paused, as if he was thinking about how to open his mouth. "I have about seven 10,000-ton freighters in my hand, and five freightship-modified freighters. I am the most near here...", he suddenly realized what It can be said that here is not going to say that there is obviously no sincerity. I can only continue to say: "The biggest shipping contractor." He quietly put the happy soil into the metal tube and suffocated. He said what he should not say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has been keenly aware of this. According to the latest military law, after the warships are dismantled and all weapons are removed, they must be dissolved. This involves some warships. The secrets, such as how many standard weapons can be carried, how many ammunition can be stored, how many soldiers can be accommodated, how many speeds are loaded, and what is the maximum speed at no load... These seemingly no big deal data, once the war breaks out will become fatal information. But he said that he has a ship modified by a warship. There is no doubt that he must be a military man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Navy does business in a certain circle is not news, Garfield also said with Du Lin, this Du Lin not only did not worry, but put down all worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the military’s style of work is a bit too good, it’s quite unreasonable, but working with these people, as long as they are not greedy, they are the best partners. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Thomas, you are a very refreshing person, I think I have learned your strength, now let me talk about my requirements. Every month I want to transport at least 500,000 bottles of wine to the various terminals of the Empire. In the future, this number will increase. The price is good. As long as the safety of these things can be guaranteed, I can make concessions as appropriate."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas’s eyes groaned. He almost blurted out and asked, “Smuggling wine?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head and looked serious and upright. No, Mr. Thomas, I am a legal and legally protected businessman. How can I violate the laws of the Empire? I have a license for winemaking and a liquor license in Irian, but my customers buy a little more each time, so I need to provide some transportation services. As for their behavior is not illegal, then it has nothing to do with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas chuckled, Du Lin’s sophistry made him feel interesting and he also had confidence in the sale. As Dulin considered, he also began to consider the interests. A bright and private wine dealer used the potential power of the Navy to smuggle him privately. He got the safety of the goods on the sea, and the navy could also get a long-term source of income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is almost a matter of no need to think. As long as Doolin can come up with what he said, then the Navy will have the ability to send it to the terminals according to his requirements. District, once this kind of transportation network is formed, no matter how the terminal changes, it will not affect their cooperation, and it is even more impossible to destroy this cooperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because both parties are "legitimate businessmen", Doolin himself does not leave Irian, and the drinks and funds are also delivered in Irian, which is legal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goods are on the Navy's ship, whether the shipment is clean or not clean, as long as it floats on the surface of the sea, the Navy says it is legal, it is legal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the rest, it has nothing to do with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely a big business. If a bottle of wine is charged 50% of the transportation cost, there will be at least 250,000 pieces of income every month. This is almost the top of last year's income. I think that Mr. Thomas’s breathing is a little bit rushing. Once the business is reached, his position within the Navy will be even stronger, so that he has the opportunity to touch the position that is known as the "red line that cannot be crossed" - Major General! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Great Patriotic War, the Empire and the Commonwealth have realized that in the short term, if there is no major military breakthrough, the war will basically not break out. . After both sides of the Civil War, the two sides have already figured out each other's sin and reality, and then rushing to launch a war is meaningless except for the loss of money. In a peaceful era that does not know how long it will last, it is basically impossible to promote the generals from the colonel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
