			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was lightly closed, but the last voice in John’s heart was like a blast of thunder, which made him feel dizzy for a moment. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly sat back in the chair, crouched at the table, gasping with a big head and a big mouth. The saliva dripped down the edge of the tooth, and suddenly he felt that he couldn't control his body. It felt like it was coming quickly, and it was going very fast. When he looked up again, he was scared to find himself lying in the medical room of the prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nose is the smell of alcohol, some nurses walking around, checking the physical condition of the prisoners on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prisons can never be "peaceful" as people imagine, here is the epitome of a society. In the case of the warden and the prison guards, these prisoners are just prisoners. But in the prisoner's group, there is a complete social form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are political and politicians, where the gangs are like one party, and their leaders are naturally leaders. They will sit together and discuss how to make the society in the prison better, let everyone love it, use it as their home, and even make some rules that everyone must abide by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are capitalists, those who have access to things from the outside, they will take the cigarettes apart and sell a lot of money by root or even the mouth. A female poster wearing clothes to rent out a night's money is enough for them to find a technical girl to play outside for three nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a middle class, a bottom of society, and a "law enforcer" who maintains internal order... This is a miniature society, which can be seen outside. It can be seen inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be conflicts in some places, and the conflicts here are more bloody and violent than the conflicts outside, and more simple. These injured people may be the losers in a conflict, or the winners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John moved his finger and asked the guy next door to the date today. The other person responded impatiently, and John realized that it was already It was two days later. This time he was in a coma for two days, which made him feel a kind of fear, as if his body was gradually uncontrolled, and God was slowly extending his arms to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his body and barely let himself sit up, and immediately the nurse came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under what the nurse said, he said: "I want to see Magus, I will plead guilty, but I must see Magus, this is there The condition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little nurse did not dare to delay this important information. Those who read the newspaper these days know what happened and they work in prison. And it is also the first prison of the Empire, which is also sensitive to politics. She immediately reported the matter to the warden of the First Prison of the Empire, and then the news went to several departments and then transferred to the hands of Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Old John’s request, Marcus agreed with it. He and John are “old friends” and they met more than 20 years ago. At that time, John was very enthusiastic and constantly "swallowed" other newspapers. He has already locked the three special publications into the largest press release supplier in the empire. After that, they sometimes have connections, often there are some important things to go to the news, or some news is out of bounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is not a good friend, his old friend is absolutely old enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Marquez’s warrant, Mr. John saw Magus in a wheelchair that night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the spirit, even the back of the horse is particularly tall and straight, John can only helplessly sighed. Time is always the biggest enemy of intelligent creatures. Because you really love this world, you will hate time. But people hate time, but they remember the years... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will plead guilty, plead guilty in front of everyone. No matter what crime you intend to add to me, I will recognize it." John knows the horse. Gus's character, he won't tell you a lot of useless things, and then use ambiguous words to give you an answer that you don't know whether it is or not. "But I have a request, as long as you promise me, this The sale of the pen was completed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus sat across from John, his hands clasped his hands and clasped his knees, a serious listening appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to amend the will... and I hope someone can go to hell with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;When I said this, Mr. John’s tone was filled with Morin’s cold hatred. His eyes narrowed twice, then blinked and stared at Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus thought for a moment, "No problem, but we need something to get Mr. Arthur with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. John reached out and said, "The deal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Thursday, the newspaper was only about nano Lindes’s story came out, and a new mayor had taken over and a password was issued. It is said that Todd did not die, but left Nanondides to go to other places. As for the gun battle in the villa area, it was a rush between the local gangs. For this reason, the new mayor’s joint police station and police investigation bureau launched a cleanup gang in the city of Nal Lindes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes a lie is stupid in your opinion, but there are also many people who feel very real, especially those who don’t contact their own interests, people More willing to believe the official statement. Some people who know the truth have been warned, and the whole city has restored its former tranquility. For this tranquility, more than 300 gang members have been sent to the Imperial Second Prison, and 39 of them will be publicly shot. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are involved in the vendetta’s police chief in the city of Nylondes, the reason is that the police chief has detained a batch of goods worth more than 200,000 yuan. Under the premise of not being able to buy the winner of the "Imperial Heroes Medal", they had a very extreme revenge on the police chief and planned the murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for what the truth is, it’s not important. The person who knows the truth of this matter has been scared by Doolin’s wrist. People who don’t know the truth. Still living their happy and happy life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are not necessarily happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or on Thursday, the same day, Arthur wore dark clothes and sat in the first position on the left side of the first row of the church. He wore sunglasses and no face. Looking at the pastor, the pastor presided over the funeral of his brother. Mark is quietly lying in the crystal coffin. After the makeup artist's dress looks like he is asleep, his face is very rosy. Listening to the boring prayers of the pastor, Arthur's mouth was pumping, not because he didn't like these eulogies, but that he remembered the fact that he was about to take over the family power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He controlled his own smile, and laughing at this time was obviously a very excessive move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only he needs to arrange two people to "discover" Mr. John hanging or suicide for any other reason, then everything belongs to him, this family, these industries, And decades of accumulation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at Nasha, who was sitting across the aisle, and his eyes flashed a stern look in his eyes. He not only killed his brother. It will also make people kill his father. In a very short time, Risser’s mind and character have undergone tremendous changes. If this change occurs earlier, perhaps there will be no ending today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is figuring out, when Nasha will disappear, so there will be no more people in the family who can interfere with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the door peng in the church was pushed out from the outside, and the loud and crisp kick made people turn around and look around involuntarily. These uninvited guests disturbed this sacred funeral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who came were wearing black trench coats, with dome felt hats, and some with sunglasses. The way they walked and made them look like they were not good things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the truth is always squeezing people's cheeks, and then "experience" into people's mouths, forcing people to swallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who walked on the first stood at Arthur’s side and took out his own investigation certificate with a coat of arms. “I am the imperial police. Senior investigator Tom of the General Administration of Investigations, Mr. Arthur has a trip with us, and some things need you to explain.", said Jerry showed a court wholesale arrest warrant to Arthur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur tried his best to maintain his calmness, but his beating apple muscle had already sold out his flustered heart. "I don't know what happened, I To see my lawyer, I will only be with the lawyer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom didn’t tell him so much nonsense, punching him directly in his stomach Then, after Arthur curled up into a shrimp in the exclamation of everyone, Jerry immediately put on his handcuffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is an arrest warrant, not a summons order, you have no choice, Mr. Arthur.", Tom took off his sunglasses and revealed blue eyes. As if you were stabbing in the heart of Arthur like a knife, "As for you looking for a lawyer, we will let you contact the lawyer after you arrive at the investigation bureau!" He slid him up with Arthur's collar. Then shoved and walked toward the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
