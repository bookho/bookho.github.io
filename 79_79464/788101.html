			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I heard Alisa say that I am leaving in the morning, and Dave’s heart still has a sneak peek, which means Alisa and the man who is not responsible. It’s over and there won’t be any follow-up. He thought of standing here very generously, patted her back in the inexplicable expression of Alisa, and even wanted to hug her - if not Alisa kicked him, he thought maybe change The occasion may be successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very polite and very well-educated, slightly succumbing to Dulin’s farewell, with a very gentleman’s expression and a standard empire with a hint of northern accent The language says a format language when saying goodbye. "I am very sorry, I have some personal things about my personal affairs. I wish you a happy time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Dave turned around, he saw a brand new silver car parked on the side of the road, a young man in a t-shirt with a beige hat and black sunglasses came out of the car. He took off his eyes and was not on the neckline of the t-shirt. It was very fashionable, and what he could not ignore was the appearance of this young man. He didn't know how to describe this young man, but he knew that when he was a man who had a good impression on a stranger who was also a man, it meant that the man was really handsome! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two almost passed by, Dave couldn’t help but sigh, some people have such a good life, born in a rich family. God also rewarded him with a perfect appearance. If his education is a little higher, it is a perfect man! Some eyes were hot on the luxury car, and he ran towards the beach below the street. If he had to go back in the morning, the earliest class would be at 9:30 to 10:00. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already seven o'clock. In this period, Irian left more people than there were, and maybe there would be no votes later. . He didn't look back. If he turned back, he would find that the young man who was almost perfect in his eyes was standing behind Doolin, just like his...just like the class! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boss, is there anything I want to do?", Doolin pointed to the chair around him, and with this action, the Buddha sat down. Some things can sometimes be ignored. For example, when there is no outsider, the Buddha in the manor is not as constrained as outside. He does not need Du Lin’s request to sit down. But there are outsiders, a lady, and the Buddha's gaze squinted slightly after a few turns on Alisa's face. This woman seems to have seen it somewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is such a feeling, it means that this woman is not a local, because the social scope and level of the Buddha have been extremely limited in the past six months. Anyone who has contacted him can remember that there is no such person. This woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is Alisa, my child's mother!", Du Lin pointed to the Buddha, said to Alisa: "All Buddha, you may Know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there were almost three or five seconds, the Buddha reacted. He stared at Alisa’s belly and looked at it. Slowly transferred to Du Lin, "boss, are you sure you said the word child?" Du Lin nodded, and all the Buddha was almost swearing. Everyone was a big boy of seventeen eighty-nine. How did the painting wind suddenly become different? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they are still working as a lofty single, Du Lin has already had children without knowing it. This is really...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should I say congratulations?", Dudu quickly adjusted his mindset, smirked and smiled, then stood up very politely and reached out with Alisa. Grip, "I am called Buddha, the surname is not important. To be honest, I was scared and I was relieved. I want to thank you, Ms. Alisa.", Buddha is a very talkative speaker. The guy, who had been on the street for a long time before Du Lin, had been jailed during the period. Nothing is more than a social university to teach a person how to treat the world, no! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that Doolin is looking at herself behind the scenes, but the Buddha does not care at all, because Alisa is not an "outsider" in his eyes. . A woman who can become pregnant for Du Lin and give birth to a child is the mother of this big family in the future, although this is not a certain thing. But the child in her belly is definitely the most powerful heir in the future, no one! Therefore, Alisa is not wrong at all. He sat back with a smile and explained what he said. "There are two young and beautiful women in the house. He is never tempted. Do you know how worried I am? I am afraid that he is fancy to me but I don’t know how to open it. Even when I sleep at night, I have to lock the door. Thanks to the grace of the gods, I don’t need to lock the door when I sleep at night, I feel at home. The restless situation has finally passed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa listened to it and then laughed, and Du Lin’s foot was on the Buddha’s On the chair, the guy's hippie smile didn't have a formal shape, and he didn't worry that what he said would make Du Lin hate. He just likes this feeling, does not need to worry about one of his own words, a certain behavior has caused the suspicion and hatred of the above people, he can do not need to consider the result of taking Du Lin in front of his own people, because they are a family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa's eyes were filled with a strange smell, and she stayed on Doolin's face. Du Lin wiped her face. "Hell, that's a joke!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "But it is not unreasonable!", Alisa followed up with a sentence, "I heard that you have two women in your family, are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged. "Is this normal? Isn't it? A maid, a female actress who temporarily lives in me, Freena, you must know."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is she?", Alisa really knows Freina. As the receptionist of the imperial central bank, it is considered a middle class in the place of Tener. It is normal to go to the opera house occasionally. Social behavior and entertainment relaxed, she nodded, "I heard that she was filming recently, is a big film...", her expression almost solidified, her eyes rounded up and looked at Doolin, " Wouldn't it be your investment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get a positive answer from Doolin, Alisa sighed Qi, "I know, I will know!", she continued to look at Du Lin, depressed the voice, "Du Lin, count me for you, this is my first time to ask you and the last time you ask, let go Hu, he knows nothing, there is no need for an innocent person to be hurt because of our affairs." She looked straight at Du Lin without fear, hoping to let Du Lin change her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long process of confrontation, Du Lin slowly nodded. "As you said, this is the only time!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa is relieved, her expression is very complicated, "Do I need to thank you for your tolerance and kindness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to do this, I don't mind!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people suddenly fell into silence, which made the Buddha’s faint consciousness When he arrived, he looked up at the parasol on his head, as if it was a beautiful woman without clothes sitting on a transparent umbrella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Alisa spoke first. "What should I do? Do you know what to pretend? Then continue to be discriminated against and ridiculed." Days?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin hesitated for a moment, took out a very luxurious blank business card from his pocket, and wrote his own phone without a signature. Put it on the table and push it. "Everything can contact me, I will help you. As for other things...", he shook his head with a smile. "Alisa, do you love me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa smiled like an awesome joke. "Don't be kidding. I hate you too late. Why do you love you? Love you let me encounter it?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I don’t have any substantial feelings for you. Except for the children in your stomach who contact us, we don’t have any emotional foundation. Whether it’s me or not Inviting you to live with me, or asking you to leave here, is actually unfair to you, to me. We can get along with friends, occasionally call to greet, there is something to help and consider each other. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is perhaps the best way we get along!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa is also aware To Du Lin said that it is very correct. Her "feelings" about Doolin only stayed on the fact that this man is the father of the child. There is no love and love. Even if there was a little bit at the beginning, it was Du Lin. Ruthless deception and abandonment are gone. She didn't know that she should show a lucky expression, to appreciate Du Lin's generosity and look at it, or to show her angry expression to confront the man's indifference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps of the distant running sounded again, Dave’s face was red and gasping, and when he ran here, he couldn’t even get up,” The ticket was bought, and we set off at 9:45 in the morning. We should go back and prepare now." He saw the owner of the luxury car when he looked up for a while, and some unexpected nods were a greeting, then he Looking to Alisa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa stood up, she stared at Doolin, "Remember our agreement!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Dooling clicked, then sat and watched the two leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dudu was just about to ask something, Du Lin shook his head and didn't let him speak. "How many people are we in Tern?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost a dozen or so, some time ago, it was very strict, and I couldn’t get it for a while. This time was a little loose, but there are strangers on the street, so They didn't dare to move for the time being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded unsatisfactorily. "See the guy just now? He called Dave, living in Oro. More, next month, arrange to send him to see God, to do a little natural, such as traffic accidents.", Du Lin Duo looked at the Buddha, "Do not put it again during the day, to be placed at night. In addition, the buddy of this store should disappear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
