			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Mr. Igor’s wife woke up from the bed, and the moment she opened her eyes, there was no movement, but no Look at the ceiling with an expression. It was not until about three minutes later that she discovered that there was something wrong with it. What is not right is that she was not violated, but she was not invaded. When her husband brought the young man back last night, she knew what would happen, but this time she was not as struggling as she was last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat up from the bed and checked her clothes to make sure she had not been subjected to any form of infringement, slightly strange. She knows her husband, a devil who is black and sweaty. He actually found a tramp to invade her, and he watched it with pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hates him, but she doesn’t show it because she and the children need this home and all the expenses. She looked at the bedroom and it was no different from before. She checked every corner of the house, exactly the same as last night. The only difference is that her husband and the handsome young man are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat on the sofa, eyesless and looked at the TV that didn’t turn on. After a while, she took a little money from the drawer. Carrying the cloth pocket for the dish to leave the house. She still has to prepare lunch for the children, and I have to pick them up by the way. She has not had much time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She calmly closed the door, glanced at the car that disappeared at the door, and a slightly smile on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the weekend, his husband won’t go anywhere! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, he went out and turned, but he didn’t come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She may not know that her husband has been buried in a wasteland more than a hundred kilometers away, but this may not mean anything to her. Life is always so helpless, and anyone who is missing must go down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is so peaceful, just like every day before, let her husband die of the culprits, but ushered in a lesson he didn’t want to see. Woman - Nasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can see that you like this girl because she looks beautiful?", Nasha's eyes are aggressive and constantly on Dove. Her wandering, her attention is always concentrated in a few special parts, from time to time, as if in questioning Doolin's aesthetics, "is indeed a beautiful girl, just looks a little smaller, and Take the liberty to ask, do you like this girl who is not very developed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not big!", Du Lin smiled back and said, the lethality of this sentence is still very amazing, Nasha's secretary is sitting on the side of her head and bowing her head, from time to time to touch the glasses, I can't wait to find A place that no one else can see hides in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She swears that there must be something between the two, otherwise Doolin could not tell the facts of Miss Nashua on certain characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha's face was slightly reddish, she was white with Doolin, her legs were holding a tray of coffee, a small mouthful of coffee, and then a few mouthfuls of coffee, then Facelessly put the coffee and the saucer back. "You are too rude, how can you say this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin Don't worry, "I'm just telling a fact, there is no other meaning, and I don't think I have offended you. The opposite is that the rude person should be you, Miss Nasha. You broke into it. My office also commented on my butler and secretary. Is this a style unique to the George family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha seems to be very happy to challenge Du Lin, Although she has not won once until now, she still enjoys it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason for coming to Otis is that Mr. John and his father have discovered this thing called "TV tape". The tapes that Du Lin issued. These tapes convey information through sound and picture, making it easier for readers to understand what they need to know by reading newspapers, and it is easier to get into the hearts of people. After all, those living politicians, or actors, are just like watching a movie that is different. The audience's impression is of course profound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised Mr. John was that when middle-class family women began to gather together to discuss the content of those sitcoms, he realized this thing. Bring the magic. He asked his son, Nasha's father, to set up a tape company belonging to the George family, and sent Nasha to Otis, hoping she could buy his company from Doolin's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the way the industry trusts work, while building it on its own. Money is meaningless to John who is already in bed, and what he needs now is greater political influence. He can see that the guy named Du Lin is indeed a talented person. In this way, he can turn the news in the newspaper into a picture, then spread it into thousands of households, and quietly affect the empire. Middle and high class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, in his opinion, it is a newspaper with images. As long as it is the newspaper industry, it belongs to his sphere of influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Nasha appeared here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sell not to sell? The company of the Empire Star, I will give you a number you can't imagine.", Nasa was a bit proud when she spoke. Yang Yang, that is definitely an amazing number, she was shocked when she heard it. She really wanted to see some of the things she wanted to see from Du Lin's face, but unfortunately, this guy was like the last time in Irian, without any surprises or anger, always smiling, half dead and alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin slowly took out a cigarette from the cigarette case, lit it, and the smoke of the cigarette rose between the two, as if the line of sight was transparent. The smoke is blocked, and even the other's eyes are not really cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think of Otis?" Du Lin suddenly asked, and this question made Nasha a little unprepared, and she nodded subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks quite shabby here, but it's not bad. It's all over the construction site. It means that it will soon be completely new.", Nasha said It’s all true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been to a bustling place, and has been to a small town like Turner. It’s not so good, but it’s awkward. The illusion, the city seems to be alive, is alive, and now this vitality is expanding and breaking out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer Nasha’s affirmation, Du Lin is still happy. He used a finger holding a cigarette to point out. “Is it interested in investing in some projects? Look at us all. As a friend, I can give you some advice to make sure you can make a lot of money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha stunned and then muttered "Hey, hello, I am talking about whether you are willing to sell that media company, not to invest here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled a few times Shaking his head, "The Empire Star is for me, just like the role of the Feature Society for your George family. Are you willing to sell your family's feature agency? If you like, I can spend it and buy it. You can't imagine the numbers to buy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not lying. If John intends to sell his three special syndicates, he will immediately be able to raise funds from various sources to shake the imperial economy to acquire John's industry. Countless people are watching his three feature agencies and his position in the newspaper industry. If he is willing to sell, many people will smash their heads and hand over the money to Du Lin for disposal. In return, they only need to give them a certain share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe tens of millions are already astronomical in the eyes of ordinary people, but Doolin believes that he wants to make up at least a hundred million dollars. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha did not counterattack Du Lin this time, but was silent. She knows that it is impossible, whether it is her grandfather or her father or her, no matter who is in power, it is impossible to sell any industry in the family, even if others buy shares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin refused her and rejected her again, which made her a little defeated. "You don't really want to work with the family? Now there is a good chance." Why do you want to give up? Do you know that we have set up a media company, you can do the same, and it will do better than you. Now your company is worth a little money, but after our company starts to operate Maybe your Imperial Star Media Company will be worth a penny!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Nasha said the full name of the company. As the first person of the third generation of the George family, whether she is willing or not, she must accept a large number of courses and auxiliary roads, both in terms of knowledge and management. She couldn't forget the goal of her trip. She said that she only deliberately made Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin listened to her after she said this sentence and snorted and stood up. He walked over to the window and turned to face the house, his hands pressed against the window, slightly chining his chin. The midday sun outside the house is very blazing, just like a ray of light shining from the sky, the whole person is integrated into the glory. He whispered with a sense of pride and self-confidence, and a contemptuous attitude: "In the field of newspaper industry, I admit that the George family is the first deserved. But in the field of television tape, not someone with money can Play well, here, I am the great king!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nasha, I advise you and hope that you can bring words to Mr. John. Now, if the investment is too big, if you want to give up, I am afraid it will be difficult to do it!" He raised his hand and took a sip of smoke and spit it out. The rolling smoke rushed over. "By the way, the reason The George family can become a trust in the newspaper industry because Mr. John was born a few years earlier than me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
