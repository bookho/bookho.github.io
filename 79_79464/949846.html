			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Soro’s death came back to Otis, Du Lin just nodded and hung up. He is very indifferent to the life and death of this person. When the other party intends to solve him through the simple and rude way of assassination, he has already decided their final result for Soro and Ernest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the next step, look at how the family of the Cape family chose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not leave the final bottom line for the Cape family. Yes, he did not forget to leave his bottom line when he killed Solo. The Pei family makes a choice. Soro and Ornes are not actually dead, or in other words, they are not dead in people's perception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They not only lived on the ferry but also went very magically, and lived in a public occasion, and finally disappeared inexplicably. Disappearing does not mean death. Death is a very positive result, but disappearance represents the unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disappearing can be regarded as if they are dead, or as they are not dead, just being held in place, or because something temporarily dragged them to let They can't appear in front of people. Under this circumstance, the Cape family will make a decision to treat the two men as dead, to directly launch a war against Doolin, or to wait for them to appear or to make sure that they will never appear. Choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they choose the former, Du Lin can launch a "war" to let these high-ranking aristocrats understand that human life is actually equal - in After the man dies. A group of "mud dog legs" from the bottom of the society who dare to fight and dare to fight against the fate, and a group of high-end clouds that are spotlessly "the core of the world", fear should not be the former, should be the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is always very fast, three days passed by, when Du Lin learned that Ferry will leave Otis to return to the north, He also took the initiative to send the princess of the Duke's house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you stay a few more days? I believe there are still many places in the city that are waiting for you to discover and explore!", Du Lin looks like a temperament It seems that the slap of Fei Lijia three days ago did not draw on his face and the city of Otis, as long as a qualified politician has long been honored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fei Lijia always keeps her sunny smile, and her eyes are inexplicable. "I am very willing to stay in the city of Otis, explore every corner of the city and find that I have never been there before. Something you have discovered. But you know, sometimes when someone like us should do something, it’s not up to us to say it.” Her hand gently pressed on Doolin’s palm, another hand-held skirt The corner was boarded a private steam locomotive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing at the door, she turned and took back her hand and politely bowed her skirt. "This city has brought me a considerable degree of shock. I never thought that a city could have so much information, which made me have a lot of gains. At the same time, I must also thank the city of Riodis for the hospitality I received during this time. Thank you very much. If you have time, I will definitely come to Otis!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I will still look forward to your coming!", Du Lin back After a few steps, the front of the steam locomotive began to whistle. After the two nodded each other, Fei Lijia turned and entered the compartment, and the steam locomotive's door was slowly closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the steam locomotive began to slow forward, the speed did not quickly disappear into people’s sights, and Du Lin shook his head like a smile They will see each other soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it’s impossible for the princess to give him ugly. He can’t do anything on the prairie. Because the lion always has a strong counterattack, so that all animals know this very clearly, and it is a price to pay for the lion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not a lion, but also a carnivore. He must show the proper exposed teeth to have a good shock. Those who have been staring at him. people. He is not Heidler. Heidler used a very stupid way to protect himself. He never responded positively to the challenges and provocations he had, even if he was a member of the Chamber of Commerce. It is because of his practice that not many people will fear him because he is "soft". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used the wrong method, from the moment he made his first concession, he was destined to have to make constant concessions until one day he did not give in Go to the other extreme or destroy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concession is a terrible behavior. Today, facing a vicious eye of others, you can make concessions, and tomorrow you may face other people’s curses and concessions. You may also choose to give in a punch. If you want to be a real person, sometimes you need to be tough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the steam locomotive, Fei Lijia asked the maid to remove the pieces of jewellery and slightly cumbersome clothes for her. She actually had to thank the new party. In the past, the aristocratic women actually did not feel happy, just wearing a body. Clothes are enough to make a lot of women crazy, plus those in the aristocrats and courts use a white but deadly powder to make themselves whiter. Many aristocratic women have only over forty springs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have to find a chance to mend up the relationship with Doolin, which really makes him very embarrassed, and now we need his talent to serve us. Fei Lijia changed her face and sat down at the tea table. The maid arranged a pot of aroma tea for her. She took a sip and put the cup back on the tea table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitall standing on one side immediately understood the meaning of Ferry, and the way Du Lin found his face was definitely not the ugly of Felicia, then only One can take on this task, and that is him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though he was reluctant, Vitor nodded. In the past few days, they have turned the main neighborhoods and entertainment areas of the city of Otis, and have to admit that Du Lin is a very talented person. It is said that he did not go to school, but the urban plan he designed gave Fei Lijia too much shock, this is a master of design... No, the design masters may not be able to plan a city like Du Lin. perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She summed up her biggest feeling in the city of Otis, that is fresh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things are fresh and full of temptations to explore, whether it’s those commercial districts or those with large entertainment facilities, total It’s a fascinating experience, and people can’t wait to discover something new. That’s why the city is full of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new SAR is sure that many things need to be re-planned. If Doolin can help, it is a good thing for her and the Fatima family. The plan seems to be just a simple drawing design work. There are actually a lot of tricks in it. The design is good, it can make them make money, let other investors make no money or even lose money, and then put these investors into the meat. With the bones swallowed, it is enough to complete the market of the largest monopoly city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The necessary mitigation measures are still needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the steam locomotive has already exited the border of Otis, and there are still 140 kilometers away from the Imperial Station. Fei Lijia also went to the Imperial Capital, visited some of the friends of the Holy Virgin, and went to the family industry of the Imperial Capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the body suddenly swayed violently, and Fei Lijia was not paying attention to the ground directly on the carriage. At the same time, the car began to tilt to one side, and the entire steam locomotive was screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitor cares on Fei Lijia’s body, the freshly brewed flower tea is drenched on him, he’s not screaming, he’s squatting like that The burning pain of the bones of the bones has stopped until all the movements have stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felika was a little embarrassed to get up from the ground, the messy hair and the whitish face looked terrified, she was hiding in her sleeves. The hand was shaking slightly, just at the moment, she thought of death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, God is finally pity his lamb, did not bring her to heaven, Vitor immediately helped her to leave the carriage with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing outside the car, the first half of the train has been derailed, trapped in soft sand, and the train conductor is also bleeding from the front of the cab. Climbed out and ran over immediately after he saw Ferriga and Vitor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? Why did the train derail?", Felicia tried to make her tone sound less volatile, and there was no aggressive questioning. But her eyes are not so friendly, and the smile on her face disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train conductor wiped the blood of the forehead, which he did not sit on during the emergency braking, and hit it on the front windshield. He licked his hand, thanked him and took a handkerchief from Fei Lijia's hand and pressed it on the forehead. He said with a smile: "The railway is partially buried in the sand. If it is pressed directly, it will not happen, but it will not happen, but The accident was a big deal. So I pulled down the handle of the emergency brake, and the train was derailed after a moment of inertia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this road There are very few things where sand is buried in the rails. Almost 30% of the trains from the south to the north need to take this road. Every day, as many as thirty or forty trains go from here, it is impossible. Give the sand a chance to bury the rails. If there is windy weather, the wrecker will also clean up the deposits on the rails in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you do now?", Felicia looked worried and looked at the front of the road that had been tilted downside the roadbed, and her heart was filled with irritability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
