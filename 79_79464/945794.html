			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't come back last night!", Soro sat at the table and worked hard, not even raising his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rarely faces such a situation. Ornes is his most trustworthy and most worthy assistant, no one. No matter what, even if there is anything that can't be known, he will hand it over to Ernes, because they are one, and they are all glory. If he does something, Ornes will be finished in the rest of his life, and he must help himself to do his best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to see an old party member in the local area last night. The state legislator has a good relationship with the Cape family, but the other party is not clear about the horse. The transaction between Gus and the governor is even less clear where the SAR will be arranged. The governor has never revealed a clear tendency, and has not asked too much about any city, but the state legislator gave Soro some guesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the SAR is bound to be in the state of Woodland, then the four cities close to the border are the most likely! There is no more convenient place than these four cities. In particular, this kind of special zone involving import and export trade will surely have a large number of goods entering the Union from the SAR. If the SAR is far from the border, many things that are already very simple will become a bit more complicated and need to run back and forth a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea Solo also knows that he is not a fool, but you know that it is useless. The Cape family can find a way to run a city mayor or a member of parliament, but it is absolutely impossible to operate the mayor and parliamentarians of four cities in one state. This has nothing to do with money, status, and power. This is a stepping horse. To rebel! Therefore, this goal must be reduced to one, and no more than two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Ornes is not there, and some people who are inconvenient to ask Soro say no to him, which makes him complain, so the tone is hard to avoid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ouines smiled and took out a cigarette, but quickly broke it and threw it into the trash. He took a bag from the table and took it apart. He spit a bite and said: "I found Richard yesterday and had a very friendly consultation with him. He is willing to help us and the governor to talk in depth again, but This price is a bit expensive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You persuaded him?", Soro put down his pen and looked surprised. "You? That's not a problem, he How much is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ten thousand dollars in cash, and one pound of dried hyphae of Gnox mushroom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash is just a head, just a thing to take care of the face, the real big head is The dried hyphae of the grimace mushroom behind. As for the current quotation of medical supplies, the dry hyphae of Gnox edulis requires about 35 yuan, which is only a quote. The quotation does not mean that there must be goods. If you want to get it, the premium of about 20% is a very common fluctuation, which is almost the same as forty yuan. The most important thing is that this thing needs to be paid. Human feelings can be obtained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grimface mushrooms have always had the term "plant gold", the market demand for such anesthetic materials without any side effects is very broad, not only the hospital needs this Essentials for surgery, some people who seek excitement also need this kind of thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People can’t always guess what’s in the illusion they’ve created. This unknown random change is a strong attraction to people who have eaten, sometimes they’ll Becoming a god, the whole world seems to be destroyed or created with their emotions and sorrows in their palms. Sometimes they will become legendary animals, soaring between heaven and earth, the endless sky is their territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom effect of Gnoum Mushroom itself can cause accidents in some people with physical illnesses, and ordinary people may also suffer from hallucinations, so the empire is strictly forbidden. Production to the processing process, prohibiting sales to ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This world is so interesting, the more people are forbidden to buy things, the more people want to buy, so the price of Ghost Mushrooms rises to a high Gold is a price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding up to almost 30,000, this can’t be said to be a small number. It’s the price of a small villa in the third district of the bustling city of Irian. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo did not hesitate in the slightest. "Give him, as long as he can talk to the governor, these are small money." He was very happy when things got progress. This means that he has taken another step toward success. "When were you so polite? Sit down and say..." Soro also took a cigarette and pushed Ernes to the edge of the sofa and pressed him. Go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ores’s ass is like sitting on the tip of a needle, just sitting down and standing up, Solo looks at him strangely, Ornes He smiled awkwardly. "I went to the bathroom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
