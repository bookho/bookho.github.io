			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to Doolin? Doolin?" It’s obvious that many Marks sat at the table and looked up in horror. He had a very good week in the previous week. Not good, although no one dares to treat him in the detention room of the police station, but the environment and the hatred in the bottom of the society make him very uncomfortable. He clearly knows that even if these people have to kill themselves, they will not make any reckless moves, but he can't sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you sleep for a little while, you will wake up and be afraid of someone doing something to him in the middle of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food that was eaten during the day was also very bad. He used to hate money trading, but this time he took the first step in his life and failed. It is. He plans to bribe a policeman to provide him with better food and rest, and promises a thousand dollars in benefits. Unfortunately, the policeman not only did not agree to his terms, but returned the matter to the police chief. Although there was no result, it became clear that the next day's meals became very difficult to swallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s more terrible is that those who are being held with him can actually eat it. It’s no exaggeration to say that the dogs in the manor eat more than this. Ok, but they can actually swallow it. It’s also because of this, let him know that it’s not that others are embarrassing him. This is how it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this is given by Baidulin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he was released, he was delayed for a long time at the police station, mainly because the court had a receipt form for him to fill out. After he came back, he took a shower, changed a suit, and let the chef make three steaks. He ate it and ate it. He swears that he has never felt that the steak can be so delicious, so delicious that he only wants to stuff the beef into his stomach and fill his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the secretary said the name of Doolin, he stunned and then reacted. "What happened to him?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary quickly spoke out what happened in the middle of Linders, and Mark listened to a bit of a brain and couldn’t turn around, then laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s smart person would actually do such a stupid thing, and really made him wonder if Du Lin was being replaced by someone, this is almost open The assault murder case is definitely the biggest news explosion point at the end of this year, no one. If this matter can be promoted to a subjective position in public opinion, even if it is really not what he did, it will become what he did. His political life is over, and he should not think about further possibilities in this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was at this time that a guest came from the deserted manor, and Arthur took a small gift in his hand and walked in from the door in a very formal dress. His serious dress is the first time Mark saw him wearing it. He had to say that Arthur really had his own unique place, such as his appearance and the temperament cultivated in such a family, plus his body. The clothes completely turned him into another person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mature, steady, confident, with a very good style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe because Arthur remorse and cry at Mr. John’s bed, the scene of truth reveals that Mark’s perception of Arthur is much better, he did not use it as before. The impatient tone asked him what he was going to do, but he took the initiative to stand up and invited him to sit down and have something to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a hanging accessory I bought outside. I think it’s pretty good to buy it, just to give it to you. The seller tells me this thing. Can drive away some bad luck, very effective.", Arthur put things on the table, his actions made Mark all startled, but quickly reacted, and really smiled and thanked. No matter what contradictions have existed between the two before, their interests are always there. They are brothers, family members, and they should be united when the family is facing the greatest difficulties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was pleased to open the box with a masked person on the mural paintings of the origins, made of wood, where can be hung There may be a crisp crash when the wind blows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like it very much..." Mark gave the little pendant to the secretary and shouted: "Hang it on the window of my study, When the wind blows in, it will ring." Of course, this is just a casual statement. If the sound of dililangdang hanging in the study room makes him unable to concentrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked the secretary to leave and asked: "Is it coming back?", Mark laughs very infectious. "If you want to come back, you can always Moving back to live, my father will say it. The family should live together, there is nothing to separate us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur smiled and sighed In one breath, in fact, when John first came out to come out, he felt deep fear. Then he used some means to let the doctor tell the truth. Mr. John was just pretending to be sick. He was actually in the second night of coma. Just woke up. This made Arthur realize that he had killed the killer. Mr. John must have known it, because before that he touched Mr. John’s hand and lifted his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a big movement and still in the daytime, Mr. John can not feel it, he has a hunch, once Mr. John safely got rid of this vortex, the first unlucky one is himself. Will he deprive him of his inheritance rights and will he reveal the stupid things he has done? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, now he suddenly feels that he has done something stupid, but he has already done it, what can he do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking Mr. John’s forgiveness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is absolutely impracticable, with his indifference between Mr. and John in recent years, almost all of his family has been lost, plus his behavior, Mr. John will never let him go. He will soon become nothing, and will soon fall from the sky, slamming into the mud, and becoming the bottom of the society, like those he is not always willing to give. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loves his current life. He doesn't want to lose his current life. The only way to do it now is to stand up and correct Mr. John to actually manipulate the industry through illegal means. Only by proving this, Mr. John will never be able to go home. In addition to this, there is one more thing to do, that is, to send Mark to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. John is alive even if he can’t come back, he can speak as long as he is alive, he can tell Mark himself the crimes he committed, and then deprived by Mark Your own inheritance and everything. If Mark is gone, he will stand up to accuse Mr. John with his courage to face moral and universal values. Perhaps some people will be willing to help him and help him to do everything he wants even dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fist hidden under the table was stunned. He smiled and said: "In fact, I also want to come back, but you know the attitude of the father..." Let your expression look more natural. "He will not agree. Then I have to quarrel again. I have nothing else to come here. Congratulations on coming out from there, and second, I want to say if there is anything." Use my place and call me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark nodded. "I know... really don't think about it?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After chatting for a while, Arthur left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Mark was busy all day, and he was calling to contact the newspapers, hoping that they would stink Dulin and speak again. Industry alliance thing. The other side is <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiring a lawyer to find a way to get Mr. John out of this case, maybe Mark can be alone, but he is still far from Mr. John. Mr. John is already a representative figure in the newspaper industry. He doesn't need to say anything. Just standing in this manor can calm down the chaotic situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Arthur called him and said that he had contacted the best lawyer of the Imperial City through a few friends, the guy named Kevin. Now Arthur is entertaining him, and the other side wants to see Mark, talk about the case, and finally decide whether to represent Mr. John's case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark immediately received 200,000 cash after receiving the call, he also wanted to hire Kevin to help him to fight the lawsuit, but Kevin now seems to disappear The same, the firm did not know his specific situation. I heard that Arthur was able to find Kevin, and he gave birth to a relief. The bastard did not add any confusion, but it was a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200,000 is his meeting for Kevin, he heard of Kevin, as long as you feed him, he will stand Defend the devil in the abyss. There is no case he does not do, only the money he does not see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark came to a relatively remote place according to the address given by Arthur, Arthur told him that there is a private club in this place, which only entertains the club. Boss friends, and some very prominent people. Although I can't see how this remote place might hide such a place, Mark finally believed in Arthur, because his attitude during this time really made him believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he got off his suitcase and finished his clothes, ready to walk into a building, suddenly rushed out from the roadside alley. The young men around the scarf, they quickly rushed to Mark's side, reaching for the suitcase in the hands of Mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is robbery! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark while secretly obsessing the inaction of the Imperial Police, while holding the box tightly, it is not two thousand, it is 200,000! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he shouted for help, a robber who couldn’t see the face pulled out a dagger from behind and stabbed Mark’s chest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Athens standing behind the window on the third floor opposite, holding a glass of wine, licking his mouth, his eyes were extraordinarily indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
