			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boss, Aide didn't come, we are waiting for him, or how?", the guy responsible for playing Kevin wearing the clothes worn by the patient, lying down In Kevin's bed. The gauze covered part of his face, only his eyes and mouth, even if he had seen Kevin, I would have to carefully distinguish it to identify who this person is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the quilt on his body, there is a pistol that has been opened for insurance, and anyone who can shoot into the room anytime, anywhere. And there are some other companions hidden in this floor. As long as Aide dares to come to the hospital, he will definitely not be able to go back alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin chuckled twice. "Aide doesn't know where to turn and then comes back. You immediately go to the roadside ambush to the Army base." He must let Keela go together and fight to get him down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good boss, I know."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hanging up the phone, Du Lin stood in front of the window and watched Eide drive the two rooms after he left, and expressed his apology, "in fifteen minutes After that, you can call for help, but if I know who you have called for help in advance, I will come to you." He calmed the owner and opened the girl's door. The girl also I don't know what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is thanks to the openers of this community, in order to prevent these wealthy households from being harassed by noise from outside, open commercial good sound insulation materials. Of course, this is not the conscience of the developers. They have increased this part of the cost and then passed it on to the buyer. So the girl who had just been outside the riots didn’t know anything. She only heard some alarms from the fire and the police, and she didn’t know what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In another fifteen minutes, you are free to be a lady. I am very happy that we have trusted each other for a short time. Nothing unpleasant! Goodbye!" Du Lin placed a small clock on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was about to leave, and the girl suddenly curiously asked, "Do you want money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Du Lin did not turn around. He leaned his face and smiled, and his left hand gently pinched the cap of the round cap. "Some things are more important than money, good night!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifteen minutes later, a policeman who was still investigating on the scene suddenly noticed a very weak cry for help on the roadside. He immediately summoned his companions and found the person calling for help and the villa of the fire in the villa opposite the fire scene. The daughter of the Lord. Even the most stupid police know what it means, the arsonist and the killer watched them here until they left fifteen minutes ago, which made their faces look very embarrassed and their faces were hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this does not blame them. Who knows that the murderer is observing the scene after the window across the road? The only thing that made the police feel confused was that the other party had kidnapped the girl and asked for a ransom. Why didn’t he follow it almost and hurriedly left after killing Mr. Alex? If you can crack this point, you may be able to find out the clues of today's arson and the murderer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the girl came out and looked at the burned home, she was a little overwhelmed. Soon she heard the bad news from the policeman’s mouth, about her father’s bad news, girl Suddenly fainted - the doctor's explanation is that there is no active blood circulation for a long time into a slow flow rate, suddenly shocked by the heartbeat to accelerate blood pressure, which caused syncope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, Ed continued to pedal on the pedals of the car's power cabin, but no matter how hard he tried, the speed was always at 40 yards, not the slightest Ups and downs. The cars he drives are all military vehicles. The military vehicles are not demanding speed, but the stability of obstacles. Besides, the speed of 40 yards is already the highest speed of mainstream cars. I am afraid that only racing cars and sports cars will be fast. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenery around them began to dim, they have left the city center, and the more they go in the outskirts, the less light there is, just As they left the city circle, the first car suddenly sank and then rolled to the side of the road. The huge fire lit up the night, and then a loud bang came from the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are heavy weapons!", the soldiers around Aide showed amazement on their faces. The empire is very strict with the management of heavy weapons. Weapons, even rifles are rare. Suddenly, the hits of heavy weapons made their scalp numb, because they were soldiers, so they knew more about the destructiveness of heavy weapons. Immediately, Eide stepped on the brakes and the car slid forward for more than a dozen meters before stopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the car have pushed the door open and it is unrealistic to rely on the car as an obstacle at this time. The bright headlights will become the other side. aims. They squatted on the ground with the night, and Ed's head was already wet with sweat. As he groaned, he looked for a sloping terrain on the side of the road and carefully observed the surrounding terrain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, if such an attack falls on the body and does not need to be rescued, it can be directly put into the coffin and buried. At the same time, he is also wondering, where is the heavy weapon from the other side? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flipped his body back down against the depression, pulled out the pistol and broke the headlights, and the headlights of the latter car were also destroyed by the soldiers, the whole environment It suddenly became dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a place less than a hundred meters away from them, they all looked at the three-eyed pike in the hands of Kina, if not in an ambush, he estimated It is necessary to take this gun from the hands of Ginna. All men have violent factors in their bones, some are dominant and some are recessive, but there is no doubt that every man has it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gun, this modern killing weapon is full of deadly temptation for men. This is the first time that Buddha has seen such a powerful gun. He can’t wait for himself. Also try to use it, "Is this your fishing rod?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kina took a look at her with a blank eye, did not speak, and changed a lens On the shoulders, carefully search for the location of the ambush. The other side is a professional soldier. The literacy is very high. The lighting ambush range of the two cars is lost. The only thing that is fortunate is that the first car is blown open, and some weak flames are burning, but it looks It will soon be extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power cabin is not an internal combustion engine and does not produce a huge flame. When the power cabin is destroyed, it can only hear the sound of steam generated by the spar and the catalyst reacting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides seem to have fallen into silence, and the high moon observes everything in the sky until one can't help but look up and observe the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked in the direction of the sound just now. In the next second, his upper body was completely torn, and blood and minced meat were like a sudden The torrential rain, the next rustling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too dark to see.” Keaer shook his head and pushed the two bullets into the magazine. “You have to think of a way.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not military personnel after all, there are no supporting weapons and equipment. If there is a flare, this battle will soon end. Eide, lying down in the depression, breathed lightly. He held the pistol tightly and remembered the Great Patriotic War. He participated in the war, but did not have a real front line. As the governor's son, he only needs to mix his qualifications and has been waiting for him. He had heard the sound of shelling that had not stopped all night, and he had heard the sound of fire as almost a torrential rain, but he did not feel the feeling on the battlefield. He was a little overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing he prayed now was that someone nearby heard "Thunder" and then called the police, so that they could break out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and by bit, the two sides are waiting for the other side to show flaws, just at this time, a beam of light shines from a distance... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An arm suddenly fell in Aide’s arms, and he was scared, and while he was throwing his arm out in a panic, he also The pistol was thrown out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muscles on his face beat uncontrollably, what he prayed, but God did not seem to respond to his prayers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car parked in a place not far from them, the light just touched them, the car came down one person, and then quickly hid, He was a little overwhelmed by the driver, he didn't know what it was all about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s Du Lin." All Buddhas jumped out of the heights and walked toward the light source with a pistol. He was already able to see some people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other members of the fellowships also began to pack toward the ambush site, and Kina re-changed a lens, nervous, and then his task is to provide Fire support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the illumination of the lights, some soldiers knew that they couldn’t hide, and immediately searched for shelters, and the two sides suddenly fell into a crossfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One party is in the dark, one side is in the clear, this exchange of fire itself is unfair, and soon the opponent’s counterattack ends in the last shot, proclaiming this The success of the field ambush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo and others started to clean the battlefield with guns. They put the soldiers who were killed and placed them neatly, and then identified their faces. Aide, who was hiding in the depression, quickly pulled out the dagger and got a knife down on his own rib. Then he inserted the dagger and closed his eyes to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aide is not here, there is no him!", the Buddha is talking, the Buddha has seen Ed twice, so he knows Ed. There are no Ede's bodies in the nine and a half bodies lying here. "Continue to search and search the car again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aid hiding in a depression In the middle of the day, it can be found that this is actually a huge tire indentation, which may be squeezed out when the cargo is full of goods from here on a rainy day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
