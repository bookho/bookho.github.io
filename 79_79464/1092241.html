			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a culture of communication in the empire. People use silver-plated silver to refer to a group in general terms. The name comes from the business cards used by these people. Whether it is Phnom Penh or silver, which means that they are big or small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, the feudal dynasty has become history, but there has been no change in this article. The nobility still uses the business card of Phnom Penh's silver side to highlight its aristocratic background. Ordinary people, even if they are mixed, such as the chairman of the imperial central bank, use only lace business cards. He is not a nobleman, and rashly using the aristocratic special things will only attract other people's jokes, and will not let others think that he is so great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the federation, there are similar groups. They don't have any noble bloodlines, no noble surnames, but they are all elites of society, even students who graduated from a famous school. The most famous in the federation are the Rose Society and the Golden Shield Society. These two associations are not gangs, they are just ordinary social groups, but there are some differences with ordinary social groups. The members of the Rosie Club are from the Omford Williams College, the first high school in the Federation to establish a branch of the School of Business, which is the university. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are tens of thousands of entrepreneurs and capitalists who have graduated from this, and a large part of these people have become the upper middle and upper layers of this social tower. In order to ensure that their own interests are not harmed by other people or groups, a group of the best members proposed to form a Rosie Club. Since the business school, the company has spread to the entire Om William College. Now there are not only capitalists in the Rose Society, but also scholars, lawyers, doctors, celebrities, government officials... This is a very standard elite group. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every graduate of Omr Williams College can join the Rosie Club, only those who have made a career within five years of graduation and have achieved certain achievements Eligible to join the Rosie Club to become an official member. If they have not made a career in the five years since graduation, they will be rejected by the Rosie Club, and no matter how they develop in the future, they will not accept them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weiwei only accepts true elites and geniuses, and does not welcome mediocrity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seemingly arrogant community is not so irritating, and every year countless people want to join the Rosie Club and become one of them. However, it is a pity that the company has accepted more than 30 people into the society at the most in the year. As the reputation of the company is growing, their standards for joining new members are becoming stricter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the Rosette, Jindun’s entry criteria have been relaxed. As long as there are certain achievements, they are welcome. Even if it was a year ago, this person became the owner or shareholder of the listed company one year later. They are all welcome. The criteria for membership are very simple, either entitled, or rich, or influential, to satisfy one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two societies are not strictly public societies in the strict sense, and it is said that there are more hidden societies on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This badge in the hands of Albert is from Golden Shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A federal shield coin size, with a gold shield on the badge with a little five divisions, surrounded by broken diamonds, makes this badge look Kind and dazzling. Jindun invited him many times, and also took the initiative to send the badge, and told him that as long as he is willing, he can join the Golden Shield Society anytime and anywhere, and become a senior member of the community. He didn't care much about this before, but now he feels he can use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wealth of 1.5 billion federal shields is more than 300 million even if it is replaced by the Imperial Star, even though the money is not his, 2% of his exercise The ten shares are about six thousand stars, which is a horrible wealth. Moreover, the group company will grow rapidly, and it will not be long before he can become a super rich. All of this is his constant hard work for three years. No one knows how much he suffered during this process, and how much humiliation he suffered at the beginning. He came over and used his determination to persevere and the desire for success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the harvest season, but Du Lin wants to ruin it all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Destroy his three years of hard work and ruin all his glory. He doesn't know how to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you believe in Doolin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then back to the empire back to the empire with hundreds of thousands or more of money to re-enter the previous life, constantly bowing to others in exchange for the opportunity to serve others , earn some hard money from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or choose to reject? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about equity? He did not grasp the equity of this part. He was only an agent. Du Lin authorized him to represent Du Lin to exercise these powers. Everything on his foundation was based on Doolin. He had no room for resistance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If..., he swallowed a bit, and there was a struggle in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, Natiya sat in the car next to Doolin, and now the relationship between the two is much more natural than when they met earlier. At the beginning, Natiya also always deliberately kept a certain distance from Du Lin. Now they have a slight touch on the body and she is not so concerned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she wiped her wet hair with a towel, she whispered, "How come suddenly want to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I was in the car, Du Lin said that she was resting there, but I didn’t expect it to be ten or twenty minutes. They were leaving. Natiya was put on pajamas and started to wash their hair and prepare to rest. And changed clothes in a hurry, and the hair did not blow dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a few seconds to come back, he smiled. "I am not used to living in someone else's home, it will make me feel Very uncomfortable, I prefer to live in our own home and do what I want to do.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya’s face is slightly rosy, she doesn’t know Does Doolin say "our home" is not suggesting anything, or is he used to use the word "we"? Of course, the word sounds more pleasing to the ear, not as hard as "my home", which makes people feel a gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a house on the federal side?", Natiya licked her hair and switched to the other side, wiping her hair with a trace of clear water. I got to the face of Doolin. Du Lin suddenly made a "you see, I was hurt" expression, which made Natiya could not help but laugh. She feels that it is a very pleasant thing to get along with Du Lin. He always keeps himself happy all the time and always makes himself laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean it...", said she took a handkerchief from the bag and naturally wiped the water stain on Du Lin's face. It is as if this is a very normal thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Natiya twitched unnaturally, and quickly retracted her hand and lowered her head. It was like being stunned. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she was in the villa of Albert, she had changed her pajamas and was washing her hair. When Doolin told her that she didn’t know what happened, she quickly changed. I didn't wear my underwear. Just when she was very natural for Du Lin to wipe the water stains on her face, Du Lin, who she met, remembered this fact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of August, the federal weather was hotter and drier than the emperor. The emperor was on the edge of the northern part of the country and has begun to cool down, but it is still hot. Everyone wears a lot of clothes, and the friction of inadvertently makes me feel a little unexpected and some other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is still the look of laughter, he will not be so serious all the time, he rubbed his hands and wiped his face. The water stains are stuffed into the pockets. I took the towel from Natiya's hand and ordered it. "Turn it over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natiya back to Doolin feels Doolin carefully Seriously wiped the wet water on her hair, thinking of the accidental touch just now, a time of confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She breeds a sense of shame in her back, but she has another inexplicable heartbeat, and her heart hits her body, making her soft and soft. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when Du Lin suddenly stopped moving, and a trace of loss was quickly replaced by cheering. She turned back and thanked Du Lin. Then I sat on the other side, looking out the window, not knowing what I was thinking. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car quickly came to the suburbs, there is an independent manor, he had plans to come to the Federation, so I have prepared everything for several years in advance. It looks no different from an ordinary manor. In fact, in the past three years, the underground of the manor has opened a secret escape route, and railroad tracks have been laid and a railcar has been placed. It takes only five minutes to move from here to a warehouse area five kilometers away, and there are other security measures that can be transferred to the city center without knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the construction of the Guar, no one else knows this secret passage, which is his safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting out of the car, Natiya sue aloud and quickly returned to the room, Du Lin did not care, and then I would talk to some people about how to do it. A big news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he came, many international hot money and international bookmakers have gathered in the Federation to start crazy preparations. Once the federal and imperial currency relations are over, the federal shield will inevitably have one. A huge increase in the round, which will bring them enough profits. According to reports from some financial analysis studios on the Imperial Xie Lisi Street, several well-known international hedge funds have begun to press, and they have quietly entered! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
