			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one born in that era can never understand the great prestige of Mr. Kesma in that era. He is like a legend, tearing. The darkness ushered in the light of the first line. Even in the new party, some people still remember Mr. Kemas. If the emperors and nobles ruled the day, then Mr. Kesma ruled the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge gunshot sounded, the first of three new cars, staggered and lost control, slammed into the street, in the tires In the collision of the road teeth, the car flew out. A large amount of water vapor appeared again in the canopy, and the thick man wiped the lens and completely fell from the canopy. The first two can be said to be unexpected, but after the third shot, the other party will find the door, he has to transfer a place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While constantly blaming the old man, thinking about how to modify this weapon that is said to be a prince, he hid in the bushes not far away, Half-squatting, raised the shotgun in his hand and pulled the trigger again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A guy who climbed out of the car was smashed by him, and the horrible scene made these people fear. Obviously there are only two people in the other party, but they can't do anything. This kind of shame makes them fear, but also gives birth to a kind of unwillingness to accept the loss - maybe, if they do not hide behind the car body to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma is not like a person in his fifties. Whenever he leaves a place, he will be bulleted in the next two or three seconds. Coverage, but these bullets can't always catch Mr. Xmas. He was like a gentleman at night, and he danced gorgeously on the street alone. Every shot was a drumstick for him. The xiuxiu sound of the bullet was the track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than five minutes, the last drum stop, a raider hiding behind the car slid softly, he touched the chest and ooze The blood, the eyes flashed a puzzle. The small hole in the door of the car just reflected the figure of Mr. Ke Ma's "Great Shore". He stood on the road, motionless, and waved at the bushes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handsome young man ran over and scratched his head. "Sir, what are we going to do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma raised his head slightly, "Help me to evacuate, I seem to be flashing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshots at night alerted many people. The director of the Orodo police station was awakened by the phone ringing in the middle of the night. He casually put on a coat and took the police to the location of the crime. At this time, many police officers have protected the scene and watched a dozen bodies on the street. He has a headache. This may be the most vicious case of the year. The key is that neither side of the case has any hidden thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orodore as the capital of Cannes is not really as full of harmony and tranquility as people have seen. The people outside the line of sight have the same killing and rushing, but those people are very rational, they put these places away from the city. Everyone knows that the governor is a very serious guy. He does not allow things that affect the image of the city to occur within the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it happens, then I am sorry, no matter who is behind these forces, he will be uprooted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, it’s really going to be a big deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police are busy searching for information on the dead bodies after the fire, and only after determining the deceased can they find another group of people who are more effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as they were busy with the city to compare the photos of these deceased, Mr. Xema had already taken the car back to Ziwei Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What people seem to have overlooked, such as doctors who have begun to receive treatment in hospitals but are not willing to "awake". For example, it seems to be sleeping, but it is actually a woman who is kicked to a coma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how long the case is going to be, the participants are already far away, and they may be able to find clues, but it will not help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, Mr. Kesma, who returned to the town, returned to the house with the support of a handsome boy, and Mrs. Kesma’s face flashed a touch of color. Immediately pushed away the young man, personally helped Mr. Zema, and checked his injuries. I couldn't find it for a long time. She looked at him. He looked away. He came over for a while, and he looked ugly and said: "The waist is flashing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Kesma breathed a sigh of relief, only to notice that Mr. Kesma had another hand carrying a basket, which was covered with a light blue cotton cloth. The basket seemed to be shaking slightly. Her face suddenly showed a happy color, and regardless of Mr. Xerma's old waist, he grabbed the basket from his hand and opened the cotton cloth. The whole person was about to melt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this Mr. Knoxma?" She opened the thick quilt, saw what she wanted to see, satisfactorily covered the cotton cloth, and the wind outside was big. She called the children with a slamming door and asked them to bring Mr. Kemas back home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, the baby girl has already been hungry for a while, Mr. Xiaoxma has been fed and left, Mr. Kesma is sitting in the rocking chair. Looking at the beloved pipe and looking at the shining stars in the sky, he is thinking about something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, he slowly said: "These people are a little familiar with me, I am going to investigate them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know one of them?", Mrs. Xerma was a little surprised, and he told her outside, so she thought that in these people, she met Like people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Xerma shook his head. "No, it’s their eyes, the same as that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr. Xerma suspects that the instigator behind this group of people is his old friend, his old friend has the same headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hospital, Mr. Xerma did not know that there was more than one person watching the battle farther away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean that there are two weird pistols in the hands of the individual, and a hidden sniper with a large amount of water vapor The shotgun, is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monitor at the time nodded. "Yes, the pistol in the hands of their main combatants looks very gorgeous. Like decorations, more than weapons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mennon pointed to the door and let the guy leave. He leaned back on the chair and his brain hurt. When he knew that Alisa was pregnant, she immediately realized that it was a perfect opportunity to seize Du Lin's little lover and his children, perhaps he was closer to the gold. He didn't think that the first people he sent were inexplicable and there was no response. Then he sent an elite executive team in the party to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feedback at the time was that someone was also eyeing Alisa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an unacceptable thing. The Mennon believes that since she can monitor the relationship between her and Du Lin by monitoring Alisa, then those who have never met can also find out. Since everyone has discovered this secret, then the next step is to see who is more effective. He didn't want to alarm the other side, nor did he have a conflict, and waited for the day that Alisa produced it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case of accidentally killing one, at least one more, this is double insurance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn't think... He put his hands on his face, and it was troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to these people’s descriptions, it’s obvious that Mr. Kemma and Layton’s bastard, maybe not Layton himself, can definitely be related to Layton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Ma’s double gun is from a hereditary Marquis collection, which is an absolute handed down craft that goes beyond the length of an ordinary pistol to give that opponent a gun A farther range and higher explosive power have always been Mr. Xerma's favorite weapon. And the long shot that would explode huge water vapor should be the shotgun of the Duke of Willy at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to swear, he has carefully avoided the guy of Mr. Zema, why is there a connection in this matter, that damn Ali Who is Sha, and what is the relationship between the damn Du Lin and Mr. Kesma. Who are the two of them, Mr. Kesma’s family, or relatives? Why didn't the group of bastards investigate and tell themselves? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mennon recalled the "stacks" that once made the nobles shudder. Whenever the black envelope appeared, it meant someone was leaving the world. He immediately sat up and summoned his housekeeper. "I immediately wrote a letter to Mr. Kesma, told him the reason for this, told him that this is our unintentional loss, we will not be chasing. This line, and ask for his forgiveness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman feels awkward when he thinks that Mr. Kesma can still kill the enemy like the same year. What is the matter when the eyes are twitching? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, everyone who knows Mr. Xema knows that Mr. Kesma is a human being, but in the dark and long years before the dawn, Mr. Xmasma wrote the myth of his own with the heads of a nobleman. No one who has received the "stacking" has ever been spared. Whether it is the Duke or the ordinary to a baron, they can't escape the pursuit of Mr. Xema. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
