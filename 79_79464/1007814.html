			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who do you think is going to kill Du Lin?" In the open-air restaurant, the two executives of the West Mine and Hendry are enjoying the fat steak. In the western top steak sales, there will never be more low-grade steaks with more fat. The more greasy things, the better the appetite. This may be related to the climate in the west and people's living habits. Even people from other places, after living here for a while, will fall in love with more fat than other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hendley skillfully manipulated the knife and fork in his hand, and he showed an innocent look. "No matter who it is, it will definitely not be me, but I want to thank." This person, he solved the big trouble for us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three looked at each other and nodded in favor of Hendry's statement. They only thought about pitlining at the beginning. By the way, they also got an extra “one-to-one fee” from his hands. It was certain that Du Lin’s so much money would be noisy. At the beginning, they didn't think that Du Lin actually had such a big influence. He was dismissed after the construction accident in Otis. He came to the west quietly and everyone saw him as a loser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has some underestimation of his weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the news of the past few days is still vivid, if he really makes this thing big, the first thing to be unfortunate is the West Mine, even if West The mine has found enough reasons to reject the arbitration that Du Lin applied for, but the matter itself has a lot of people to pay attention to. Now these troubles have been solved by the lovely assassins. Du Lin is in the rescue. It is said that the most dangerous bullet almost shattered his head and wiped a trace on the left side of his left ear. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three said something over the Yagur Mountains. Soon after Hendry paid the bill, the three stood up and prepared to leave. In the afternoon they would Organize a small internal meeting of the Western Mining Association to discuss the work on strengthening the management of the Yagur Mountains, and seek permission from the state government to manage the mining rules of the Yagur Mountains. Once this idea can be realized, the strength of the West Mine will be further enhanced in the west, and even those who are gold diggers must abide by the system of the Western Mining Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time it was already at the end of February and early March, the weather had already thawed, and the spring was no longer far away. There were more and more pedestrians on the road, taking off the heavy cotton coat. Fur, everyone seems to be relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the three finally bid farewell to each other and leave, suddenly two of them were wearing linen windbreakers, hands in their pockets of windbreakers, with a hat, and walked over the low-lying pedestrians. At the moment they passed by the three, they pulled out their pistols hidden in their pockets and pulled the trigger without hesitation at the three people standing on the side of the road. The guns of both pistols were completely emptied, and the two talents dropped their weapons and turned quickly into the alley next to them and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams of the pedestrians and the sirens of the police cars quickly formed a special movement, adding a touch of haze to the western part of the cloud-covered top! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assassination, explosion, car accident, the whole west seems to be messed up at once, the news quickly spread to the cabinet, the cabinet is angry, the governors of the three states I endured a half-hour resentment on the phone. Finally, the imperial defense minister told them that if there were no clues in a week, then the entire western region would enter military control. A large number of terrorist attacks have had a tremendous impact on the entire society, and even some cities in the south have been affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one likes war, the terrorist attack that is erupting in the west is like a pre-war prelude, so that everyone’s heart is covered by an invisible handcuff Forcing them to recall the tragic war more than twenty years ago! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Defence issued an ultimatum to the three western states, but still issued a command to suppress the riots in the Western Military Region before the time has arrived. Further notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman’s car turned around and turned around in the middle of the road. Now he has no time to visit Du Lin’s injury, and he also feels that the west is gradually not coming. Under your own control. What made him more unimaginable is far from over. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 3:15 pm, a steam locomotive departed from the east coast of the Empire and ending at the Otaru Port of the New West Coast of the Empire, entered the west. The first time this steam locomotive entered the west, it was targeted by a group of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in the past, if a steam locomotive was looted in the west is definitely not a big deal, it is a miracle to cross the west safely. There are too many horsemen and robbers who rely on the railway to live on this vast land. They have already had their own mature plans for robbing steam locomotives. It was not until the advent of the new era that this situation improved. The capitalists, in order to ensure that their goods would not be robbed halfway, they towed the weapon-mounted platform on the steam locomotive, which was completely unimaginable in the old society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, things that happened in the past will be staged again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These stables have different hair color, ochre and appearance characteristics than imperial citizens. They are slaves from all over the world. Under Du Lin's arrangement, they were freed and actively wanted to contribute some insignificant power to their compatriots who were still persecuted. It is very irrational to attack a mining area directly. At the beginning of the construction of the mining camp, it will take into account the possibility of external attacks. It is difficult to attack a camp like a military restricted area, unless it is sacrificed several times or even ten times It is only possible for the number of mine protection teams to break into the mining area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these are fighting for freedom, and got a guy called the "Freedom Front" code, they will save the train from the East Coast. More than 3,000 slaves, even if they could sacrifice this attack. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are rivers in the west, but the branches are not dense, and there is a sparse one here. People tend to form settlements along the river and eventually become cities. Steam locomotives are often replenished on the outskirts of the city. Sometimes there are supply stations in the Gobi where there is water. The location of this attack is in the east-central part of the west, on the edge of a wild lake with no name. Supply station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the person on the bus rides into the supply station on the fast horse, everyone starts to prepare, and the smoke column is getting closer and closer as the distance rises. This battle is about to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the steam locomotive began to slow down. When the train conductor pulled the brake to the lowest position, the train slowly stopped in the friction of the metal. He sorted it out. I dressed my own clothes and jumped out of the train after wearing the hat. He prefers a down-to-earth feeling compared to the small space in the train. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the two workers wearing leather bibs next to the supply station. Some strange questions asked: "Where did Mike go? I didn't seem to have seen it." You?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them replied lazily: "Ghosts know where he went, is there something, decent person?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train conductor couldn’t help but shook his head. The decent person was the name of the workers in the west who were from other places. It sounded like they were praising them, but they actually satirized them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need Essex II catalyst, twenty-five gallons." Then he took out a banknote and clicked it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first catalyst that is consumed in the reaction of the catalyst and the twin is the catalyst, or neutralized the violent reaction, which will make the reaction not Warm and not fire. For civilian use, this kind of reaction is a bit lacking, but it is not a big problem, but it is obviously not enough for a big guy like a steam locomotive. Every time you stop a steam locomotive at a refueling station, you only need two things, catalyst and water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two workers were in a tight heart, but they quickly settled down. The two men stood up in a lazy way and walked into the small house in the supply station. People asked: "Do we change it for you, or do you change it yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course you help me change, do I have to do this myself." "The train captain frowned. These people are far less clean and neat than Mike. When he looked down at the banknotes in his hand again, he couldn't help but complain. "Damn, how many have I counted?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire replenishment process lasts for about fifteen minutes. When replacing the weakly reacting catalyst, these catalysts need to be emptied before new catalysts can be introduced. A simple kinetic energy bin cleaning - in fact, is not complicated, use a special cleaning nozzle to insert into the kinetic energy bin, spray the wall with water once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, there will be a short break on the train, some tired people will walk down, if they are tourists, they may buy A little bit of the specialty sold here, or buy some food and water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supply station staff who sell goods are absent-mindedly selling things, their eyes are always on the carriages of each section, when they find out from the ninth section When the last train of the train began without any movement, it was already known where the slaves sent by the batch were held. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man holding a box selling goods went to the ninth car and knocked on the door of the car. "Do you want to buy some things from the gentlemen and ladies inside?" We have cigarettes and bread, as well as fresh bacon and drinks..." He said, slamming the door a few times, the door slammed open from the inside, and a fierce person squinted out. Head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, get out..." He was a little impatient and might have been woken up, so he had some temper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
