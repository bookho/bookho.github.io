			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the East Coast Entertainment Company, Du Lin stood by the car and looked at Albert, who opened the door for him, raising his hand to play the collar for him. Gray, "Help me do one thing!", before Albert reacted, Du Lin continued: "The East Coast Entertainment has 16 theaters, to figure out the size, size, construction costs and health of these theaters. The time, as well as the business situation in the past year, all the expenses in the work you record yourself, and finally I will settle it with you. This is an opportunity, Albert, I hope you can catch it!", he patted Albert's arm got into the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the silver House is not glaring, Albert reacts, his excited face is red, no image He snorted and pretended to be a boxer, standing on the street and stroking the lamppost several times. Of course, he did not know what Du Lin’s last words meant. He was also pleased with his efforts. After paying so much, he finally got a return. If he can do this well, it means that he may become a "Dulin's person", specializing in serving a big customer, or even opening a real manager company himself, rather than hanging up in a sales company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time he was also a boss, and he was able to complete the goal of a stage in his life, but it was all based on his ability to complete Du Lin’s account. Under the premise of the task. He didn't care about the people around him watching his horrified eyes. He took a few deep breaths and shouted "Albert cheers" and then ran to the nearest cinema with a briefcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s confession to Albert’s mission stemmed from his distrust of Eric, who asked him if he had anything in the conference room. To say, he asked a question, that is, the value of the net assets of East Coast Entertainment. This problem made Eric hesitate for about ten seconds to give a figure of more than one million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really not a small number. You must know that the deposit that Du Lin found from the Treasury’s vault is only this number, but Du Lin does not believe that the number Eric said is true. He said that he needs to go back and think about it. After all, it is a huge investment of 200,000 yuan. It is necessary to find a professional person to look at the contract, and then leave the meeting room and say goodbye to Eric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this brief meeting, Doolin has two new doubts. The first doubt is that Eric emphasized Dulin as an investor. The power to enjoy dividends cannot be arbitrarily dictated by the operation and development of the company. Since they want to guarantee the sovereignty of the company, it is still the problem, why not lend? The second problem is that they emphasize that they will continue to invest in the company. Since there is money that can be used for additional investment, why not take it out now is nothing more than to create an illusion. This company is very important to them. The company has a comprehensive development plan and a great goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unclear how to explain when you look at other people with colored eyes. Now Du Lin wears a pair of colored glasses called doubt. Although he feels that this investment is very problematic, he is equally interested. He is interested in how to swallow the company without spending a penny and swallow it as legally as possible. After all, he is a civilized person. The success of the upper class of fame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to the manor, the Buddha is already here, and there is a stranger. When I saw Du Lin coming back, both the Buddha and the stranger stood up and greeted him. "This is Abigail. He is the most famous among the compatriots living in Irian. The evaluation is also the best." At the same time, I also introduced Doolin to Abbien. "This is my boss, Doolin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abien immediately stepped forward and stretched out With his own hands, Du Lin casually held a grip with him and invited him to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every piece of the living room in the luxurious living room, each piece of furniture is equal to the money in Abyen’s eyes, if not for these years He has a high prestige and a good reputation among the gullists of Irian, and he may not be as calm as he is now. This compatriot is really too rich, and the money that is rich in his house is more than the wealth of all the gulls of Irian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this relatively more open and free city, the situation of the Guarts is slightly better than other places, and they are also able to reach some high society figures. So Abbey didn't have any foreign appearance, even though his heart beats very fast. He didn't know what the rich, overweight Guart had to do with him, but he knew that no matter what the other person said, he had to deal with it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think that all Guarts are family members, and the blood from the first kings flows through the blood. We all grow up under the watchful eyes of the gods. We are all family." Du Lin’s first sentence brought Abigail’s heart up. If Du Lin said anything about it, he would be very relaxed, and that person would not make anything. Amazing things, they may only want a satisfactory result. But when Du Lin mentioned the first king and the gods in his mouth, then his next words would not be too small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abien nodded his head, and Du Lin continued for a while before continuing. "As a family, I have reason to give my happiness." Give it to my family. I won't give you money directly, I won't give you everything I want, but I will give you an opportunity. Mr. Abbey, in the place where I was born, I built an organization called The fellowship, only the Guarts are allowed to join. This is actually not an organization, this is a family, a big family, and this is the opportunity I have provided to the Guarts living in Irian."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Join the fellowship, we are a family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't join, then we are just passers-by!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the charter of the association, you can bring it back and see, I hope that you can become the first family to join the fellowship, fight for the Guar.", Du Lin let Jose to sort out A good charter was taught to Abien, and Abigail nodded all the way, without opening a mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that the wealthy compatriots had great ambitions. In the face of such people, he only wanted to refuse and did not want to cooperate. In Irian, the living environment of the Guarts is much better than the compatriots in other places. At least here, as long as you work hard, you can find a fairly good job. There is no need to put the ethnic group for the benefit of someone. Involved in the chaos of struggle. As a representative of the Guartes, he has always maintained a very positive concept, and absolutely does not favor any forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neutral attitude does avoid several crises, but it also makes the Guar’s development very slow. So far, Irian’s is full of opportunities. In the city, there has not been a rich guar, this is the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Abbie’s point of view, he feels that he has done a good job and has already secured enough space for the Guars to live with others. What kind of competition? However, he does not understand that if a race cannot make a strong voice, it will always be an inferior race. Why is the social status of the provincial sage higher than that of the guar? Both are descendants of the dead, and there is no difference in essence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why this can happen is that the provincial people are actively involved in this society and compete for social resources, and are willing to do bigger things. Dedicating more power to this empire and society. On the other hand, the reinstatement extremist organizations of the province are still active in various parts of the country. They take various measures to make the upper levels of the empire annoyed, and only then will the high-level organizations agree to improve the social status of the provincial sages. The reduction of the provincial sage is forced by life to join the extremist organizations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting the Guartes, independence, not gregarious, not arguing, not obeying, then not bullying you who bully? Even though a very large number of gualts stood up and raised the banner of the nation, they were quickly shackled by their own high-ranking empire. In another world, there is a saying that Du Lin feels right. The crying child has milk to eat. In this world, it is also the same reason. People who can make trouble can attract attention and get the policy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
