			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is such a small story that a very famous doctor hopes to find a young person in a group of suitable young people to inherit his own clothes, in himself On the basis of medical science, we push what we study into the next stage. His age is already very large, he can't complete it himself, he can only put his hopes on the students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a period of observation, a very famous doctor chose one of many children that he thought was the most appropriate, and his friend joked He, do you want to test the character of this young man, whether he can take on this important task. He will let another well-known pharmaceutical company spend a lot of money trying to dig this kid away. If it succeeds, it means that he is only a small person who values ​​the immediate interests. It is not worthy of the doctor to entrust his life's research and future to him. If he can keep his heart unwavering, it means that he is indeed the most suitable person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor euphemistically rejected the friend’s request and told him that if you think that your choice is right, then strengthen your thoughts and put the next Things are handed over to God to deal with. Don't test humanity, it will only disappoint yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many years, the doctor died and the students grew up. On the basis of the doctor's academics, he extended many medical academic theories and verifications. Very famous big man. When he heard this news from elsewhere when he was old, he was tearful. He told his friends that if his teacher did what he did, he would not have him today, nor would he have these achievements, because he would never be able to get a "full score" in such an exam. At that time, his family was very poor, his father had passed away, his mother was seriously ill and could not work in bed, and he still had to pay the tuition fees of his younger siblings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone takes a high salary to hire him to leave the teacher, he will agree at the time, because the ideal will never rival the reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People will only pin their demands for reality on their future ideals when they are unable to meet their real needs, just like many entrepreneurs hope to have their own day Can become a world-renowned big man and work hard for it. But if someone is willing to give him a price that he can't refuse, let him give up his business and concentrate on working for himself, then the ideal will be stepped on by reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humanity is a test that cannot withstand the test. When the test begins, it is destined to end up in the test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the best excuse Du Lin has found for himself. Walter can reject all the temptations, but he doesn't do that. It wasn't that Du Lin didn't believe him. He didn't believe he could stick to his own heart, so he crossed the red line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Natiya made a request to Du Lin, she needs to go back, some things have happened, they must finish it . The last time she forgave Walt, but Walter was disappointing. He betrayed the family and hurt his daughter. This is something she can't bear anymore. She needs to take Melissa away from Walter. Now that Walter is crazy, no one can guarantee that he will hurt Melissa further... With that, she also wants to see the woman. What kind of difference can make a man betray his wife and children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He personally ruined this home, just because of a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya’s departure does not interfere with Doolin’s next move. Mr. Sail has officially invited him to the resort for two days and said that he has invited Some good friends are with them, which means that Mr. Sail has convinced some people and made the final decision. This is the best news of many good news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending Natiya, Du Lin let people send themselves to the quiet valley like the heaven that fell in the dust, Mr. Sail stood this time. He was greeted outside the door, which means that he has already approved Du Lin and given Du Lin enough respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are three friends this time, you will like them, just like they will love you!", Mr. Sail looks very healthy and emboldened Full, not quite like this old man of his age. People say that money is evil, it is a bad thing, but they have never experienced the inexhaustible money that can bring something for themselves and for their own lives, not just simple numbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youngest of these people, in addition to Du Lin, are also in their fifties. It’s a glorious glory for them to build a national race. heavy burden. From the new consortium threatened to make them sleepy, no one wants to be nailed to the shame column by a group of people, pointed to by a group of people, see, this bastard ancestors let us lose everything we have! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when they heard that Sail had a seemingly good plan to change the current situation, the group gathered here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely not a treason, but a reconstruction of the country! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They provide everyone with everything they need to live. These people are now planning to give them ugly, so let them know who is the country. Real master! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no other extra person in the room. After Mr. Sail introduced Dulin, everyone sat down and began to discuss this matter in more detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In principle we have agreed and are willing to support your plan, Doolin." The opening statement was made by the owner of Sail, he said, "If you let the current The situation continues uncontrollably. We are likely to face a civil strife, which will shake the foundation of the federation. Perhaps your methods and methods can provide us with a clearer idea, tell your ideas and tell everyone. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money, wealth, no matter what kind of commodity value, can no longer interfere with the hearts of these people, they continue to The expectation of mastering supreme power is much higher than the number in the bank. As long as the power does not waver, the money is what they want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gentlemen, I don’t know if you have heard of a saying? If a tree grows up, the farmer will use it when conditions permit. Wire and steel to help it straighten again, but what if he doesn't allow it?", Du Lin faced the four family members who had never had the timidity of the family. He had seen too many big men. Not enough for him to breed the fearful attitude, but feel very ordinary. In this state, what he said would be more convincing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t wait for these old people to answer, Doolin gave the answer himself. “We can change the problem of the young saplings, but we can’t solve those real problems. Whether the big tree grows according to our needs, we can't change anything, except to completely cut it off!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We pushed the tree to use The decaying branches and leaves of the trees act as fertilizers, and then plant a small tree. At this time we have a wealth of experience, enough to let us know when and what to do, whether it is wire or steel." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know more or less about the federal issue, so I think the best way now is to push the building that has been dumped at any time." Ping, and then according to your own ideas, with a wealth of experience, plant a brand new sapling. You can let it grow straight, but also let it bend, this is what everyone will do in the future, we need to discuss How is it finished? To get rid of the old tree, or a building "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
