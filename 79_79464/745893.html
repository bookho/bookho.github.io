			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean the group of foreigners?", Evan stood up in surprise, his face suddenly stiff, his arm slammed, and the lobster pliers He clamped his finger when he didn't pay attention to it. Albert couldn't help but laugh, bypassing the oven and helping him get rid of his fingers from the pliers and nodded with a smile. Evan took a sigh of relief. In his estimation, the rich man from the foreign land was worth at least two million. He did not expect to be put on the line by Albert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but look up and down Albert and patted him on the shoulder. "Good, I know you guys can do it." Talk about it, how did you get on the line with him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert said briefly about his perseverance in the past six months, and Ivan again Looking at Albert, he might have said that he couldn't do Albert's teacher, but he felt that Albert still had a lot to learn with himself. But today he discovered that in just a few years, Albert has grown to the point where he is surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a cup of three dollars of coffee and a burritos and a steady schedule, he spent half a year to seize this customer, not only Enough eyesight, enough patience and skin thickness. In the eyes of Ivan, Albert has all the elements of success. He lacks only one. Now this opportunity has been caught by him, and this is his own opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hesitate to agree to Albert’s request, "I am very grateful that you can think of me at this time, you know this is very same for me. The important thing, tell me now what you need to do, what do I need to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sit on the edge of the oven and fiddle with those who are roasting The sizzling seafood on the stove, as a native of Irian, they don’t need complicated processes to eat seafood. They often only need a bunch of fire and a grill. They don’t need any sauces and sauces. They just fish from the sea. The seafood itself has a light salty taste, and the strong flavor is already the perfect cooking method. Once a senior top chef said that the more perfect the material, the easier the cooking method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know East Coast Entertainment?" Albert used iron fiber to poke the abalone that had begun to shrink. The abalone writhed his body but could not escape. The hell of hell, "Boss intends to invest in the company, but he feels that there is a problem, and then send this task to me, I need to find out if there is any trap or trap in the financing of this company. What is your good way? ,Ivan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan pressed the lobster that hurt him to the baking tray with a clip and watched the shrimp shell gradually turn red. He looked up and said slowly: "Albert, if you want to know if these people have problems." In fact, it is very simple, we are in stock!", his hand forced, the clip cut from the head and body of the lobster, the fat syrup suddenly splashed out on the charcoal, set off a trace of blue smoke "We will buy shares directly, and then we will know if there are any traps."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert suddenly realized that this is a good way, but he soon 踌躇Get up, "But the question is where does the money come from? I have read the prospectus and need at least 5,000 yuan. The problem is that I don't have that much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "House, car, jewelry, valuable things, there is always a way. I take three thousand out, the rest of you think of ways."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two no longer considered the matter of money, and discussed the details and then separated immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Albert and Ivan met at the appointed place. He handed the briefcase in his hand to Evan and patted it hard. His hand, "I thought, five thousand pieces may not be a problem to try, here is 25,000 pieces, it should be enough to play."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan a glimpse, then asked, "Where did you get so much money? I tell you, opportunities are there every day, but if you do something you should not do, even if you have more opportunities It’s impossible to achieve!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert smiled and patted his ass, some free and easy said: “I mortgaged the house to the bank. You know, I know people in this area, so I only got the money in ten minutes, although it is a little less."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan is not talking, He patted Albert's shoulder and turned and ran into a car on the side of the road. When the car started, he said to Albert across the window: "Reassured I won't let you down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Ivan and one of his friends came to the East Coast Entertainment Company’s lobby for today’s In the play, he deliberately rented a high-end suit and a luxury car. The rent for one day would cost sixty yuan. If it was not for Albert and his future, he would not have such a great effort to do such a luxury. . Miss Lilith, who was in charge of the reception on the first floor, introduced them to the second floor. Soon Ivan saw Albert’s bearded Eric. The same rhetoric and tone did not change at all, but this time it was different. It was Yi Wen who decided to take a stake on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric’s smiling facial features have become vivid. He stood up and shook Ivan’s hand hard. “Thank you for your recognition of East Coast Entertainment, you will find that this is the most correct thing in your life. One thing." He hooked his fingers, and Lilith, who had already prepared, took another agreement and attached two pens. "If there is no problem, we will sign it!" Rick signed his name on the two agreements and pushed the agreement to Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Ivan is very nervous at this time, because as long as he signed the name, it means that more than 20,000 yuan in the briefcase will become Rick's stuff, if the plan fails, or if Mr. 350,000 is not willing to pay for it, Albert will lose his most important thing, the house! This pen is very light and heavy. It seems that I feel the hesitation of Evan. Eric did not urge him, but said he could consider it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan looked at Eric with a slight smile. "I hope that as you said, this is my most correct decision!" ", he picked up the pen and quickly signed his name on the agreement." Eric nodded with satisfaction. He carefully reviewed the two agreements and handed one of them to Lilith. She must take care of it and then give another one to Ivan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, from now on you are the partner of the company, you don't need to work for anything, you can get a lot of movies every time you release a movie. Dividends. Of course, I have something to ask you..." After Evan made a statement, Eric continued: "This company is the hard work of my two friends, maybe you have read the newspaper, we The friend of a friend was troubled by us because of a female watch. He told me two days ago that he did not want to see the crystal of our friendship becoming a company full of copper smell. I hope we can cancel the plan and I promised. Eric carefully observed the change of expression on Evan's face. When he saw his frown, he immediately added: "I admit that I deceived him. You know, if the company does not catch up with the trend, it will already be The trend is abandoning, I hope that you can keep the stock of shares in a short period of time, and we can disclose it after we update the playback equipment in the theater."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "At that time It doesn't make much sense to ask him to come to me, so... can you promise me this little request? Just don't take the initiative to disclose it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Perhaps this is the problem, and Evan’s face reveals a smile that makes Eric somewhat unclear, but he thinks this should be a smile that represents a good side. Evan nodded his hand and said, "The friendship between you and your friends is moving. It's like something you said is not a great thing, I promise you!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
