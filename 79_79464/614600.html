			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Xerma’s gaze looked to his eldest son with Doolin’s words, and there was a faint sorrow and worry in his eyes. To be honest, he thinks that Doolin’s career in the city of Tener is very dangerous. Otherwise, he does not need to send two pistols back to his family at this time. This means that the enemy may cross Doolin, Mr. Work with his family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma knows the word, but he has not received a higher education, but he has told him a little bit of life experience and experience over the years, that is when you plan When giving someone a punch, others may be thinking about whether or not to give you a punch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hopes that his children can grow up safely and normally, and then form a family that may be dissonant or unhappy, but absolutely flat and warm, and give birth to a child. Two or many children, though ordinary but happy, have lived a lifetime, even if they are not rich in life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is destroying his wishes, but he also knows that calling for a pause at this time is tantamount to placing his head under the sickle, waiting for the last second. 's arrival Mr. Kesma is a very good farmer and a good hunter. He knows that when the hunter is still a hunter, the prey is still a prey. But if the hunter loses his identity and loses his hunting spirit, the hunter will become a prey and the prey will become a hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a road that never stops, can never turn back, or is like a hunter who is excellent and will become better, killing all nearby Carnivores, either changing their roles, hunted more hunters and escaped as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma is a stereotyped person, a stubborn person, a person with a "dictatorship" spirit, so his love became a failure in the prey. Hunters are not willing to be stupid prey in the hands of hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you hurt some people's family?" asked Mr. Kesma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin wants to lie, wants to say no, but Mr. Ma’s stereotyped education still has a great impact on him, he hesitated, point Nodded, "Yes father, I once hurt a guy's wife, peeled her into the pole. I also sent a group of people who deceived me and caused me a lot of trouble to hell. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Xerma did not violently thunder like Du Lin’s imagination, nor did he feel angry at this time. He gave Du Lin’s feeling at this time, like a wise old man, quiet and peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not seen the slightest remorse from your face, nor have you seen your fear. Is the woman who was peeled off by you a Guar? "Duo Lin nodded, and Mr. Kesma actually showed a smile that was almost indistinguishable. "If the Guartes, then I will not blame you, because each betrayed the blood of King Odello. People must pay for their actions and must be tried."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The one who deceives you has caused you a lot of damage, Or do you get any trouble? Are they Guar?" Du Lin nodded first and shook his head. Mr. Kemma quickly understood it. He patted Mason. The shoulders, "Go and clean up, I will get out of the town with this bastard tomorrow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is really surprised, surprised at Kes Mr. Ma can interpret and understand the information he needs with his unique wisdom and methods, and he can also feel it. Mr. Charisma for him, Mason, for the whole family with a deep sense of love, which he had never felt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma agreed to let Mason leave here and go to Tuner with Du Lin. It’s not because Du Lin is rich now, he can let the eldest son go to eat spicy and spicy. Because Du Lin is facing danger, he needs someone who can help him behind him so that he can charge forward with all his heart. This person can't be a stranger, can't be a friend, can't be a very good brother, can only be a loved one, has blood links to each other, can fully trust each other's loved ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, this is also protecting Mason himself, in protecting every member of the Xema family. Mr. Kesma is a farmer, but he has his own knowledge and wisdom. He knows that only Du Lin is constantly strong and their talents can get real Security. Instead of expecting others to put down the butcher's knife, it is better to send them to hell before they lift the knife! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pinching Mason’s neck, Mr. Kemer suddenly felt a burst of fatigue, he licked his hand and drove two bastards out of his “ Royal Palace." Looking at the small wooden box on the bed, he simply cleaned up, and then put the small wooden box with the pistol in his secret treasure house, which is the "treasure house" that everyone knows! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
