			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a good thing to join someone, indicating that we have the strength to represent the majority of people, let them add in, I will go at night. I will meet you." After Du Lin said this, he turned his head and turned away. Just when he had already gone downstairs, Du Lin called him back. "First wait, don't let them join the fellowship now, hire them in the name of the company to become employees of the company, arrange them to deliver."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Buddha called back, Du Lin also had his own consideration. Just three or five seconds after he agreed to let these people join the fellowship, he suddenly realized a problem - the fellowship exists in whatever form and for what purpose, in the eyes of many people, this is A gang. As Graf's bastard said, this is a gang, not a society with other purposes in the form of a group. This is a gang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin does not object, but does not agree that there is bound to be a shadow in the sun, but he does not want to say that he will be mentioned in the future. The first reaction is the identity of the gang leader. It's not that he looks down on this identity, but that he needs more "business cards" and reduces some negative things as much as possible. Then the light and the darkness must be separated from the chaos and placed on both hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand is bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand is dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some people are born to be able to open a path in the blood and fire, but some people are not suitable for this road. He said all the big words, and he couldn't force those who didn't go this way to die. So it would be better to arrange them on the bright side and become employees of the company. This not only solves some of the problems of confidentiality, but also does what he promises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s sudden change of mind did not make the Buddha feel strange. He knew that he was not a smart person, so all he needed was obedience. He nodded and turned away. Doolin returned to the house to pack himself up and prepare to go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the morning paper that the Buddha had taken with him. The black bold title read "The Victory of Justice". Below is Kevin and the girl in court. The picture of the hug. They won the lawsuit, especially Kevin took out more evidence, and let the two witnesses supplement the testimony, plus the "murderer" confession, defeated Camille in one fell swoop and won the victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are still some doubts in this lawsuit, but as Kevin said before the incident, when most people want to stand on the side of justice, justice is by their side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge knew that there was still a problem in the case, but forced by public opinion and pressure from the top, he still announced that the girl was acquitted and also announced Camille’s “death penalty”. The public opinion is cheering, the people who are full of sense of justice are cheering, and the big men are also relieved, are they happy, aren’t they? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the minority of Camille...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, justice is "sacrifice"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin has left Tyne and went to the capital of the Empire to start his new journey. He also drew a perfect ending for everything he had in the past. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now, Du Lin will also fill in the last one for the sudden outburst of this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear, what's wrong with your wrist?", the mayor of the city of Tener was holding milk tea with milk and sugar, and unintentionally glimpsed The bruise on the wrist of his wife, Vivian, asked, and he reached out and grabbed Mrs. Vivian's wrist, but she was hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor is called Peter, Peter Turner, Ogildin, born in a middle-class family, graduated from the Imperial Army Second College before his graduation, and was assigned after graduation. Going to the Candos Orodo Army General Force, and later transferred to the gendarmerie, and thus met Vivian, from now on, from military to political figures, became the mayor. From the outside, he is a very attractive middle-aged male, with meticulous hair and mature male faces, which are enough to attract many women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been exercising, so his body shape is also very good, the power of the grip gives him a heavy feeling, is a charming guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his wife avoiding his own hands, he smiled unconsciously. Although he was a little angry in his heart, he could not see anything from his face. Come. He still has a lot of places to rely on his father-in-law who is lying on the bed, so he is very forgiving for his wife's various rudeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you accidentally get caught, it's a small matter." Vivienne's eyes were gone, and her father told her that this is definitely not a marriage that can be happy. An ambitious man is full of charm, can be a moment of lover, but not the best companion. At that time, she did not understand what this sentence meant. She married Peter without hesitation, but she now understands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter smiled and nodded. "Be careful later, there is something to let people do it. You look at them."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Weian nodded with a little hypocritical smile and said, "I am full," and got up and left. Peter glanced at the breakfast she had not touched before, and shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weiwei is very annoyed, even though she knows that her mayor’s husband has a lover outside, there may be more than one, but she still hopes that he can come back for the night. Maintain the minimum dignity of each other. But yesterday he didn't come back, even if he came out from the study room in the morning, saying that he was not disturbing her rest. It was late at night. When she slept in the study, she knew very well that he came back in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, she sneered, then told the butler to prepare for the car, she was going to find Delier, and the delicious little guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bruise on her wrist is the trace of the last joy, Vivienne is a very tough person, even if she can always show euphemism A gentle smile, but in the bones, she is a strong person. She likes to conquer those teenagers, or... is conquered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of Jon’s young man, she has some itching in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This marriage was a terrible political union from the beginning, perhaps she had loved it, but she was already awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she saw De Lier, whose face was still blue and had not faded, she thought of her previous embarrassment and said, "You said that." Three people have already found it, and if you want to do something, I have already avenged you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delier has a nice smile on his face, then Then I took a sigh of relief. "I really thank you very much, but I have a small pleading. I don't know if you can promise. This is indeed a bit rude."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
