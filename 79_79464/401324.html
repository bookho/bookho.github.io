			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the steward’s eyes full of caution and caution, Du Lin’s expressionless and Graf stood outside the gate of the manor, waiting for about ten minutes. At the time, they were told that they could go in. Big rich people like Heidele, big capitalists, naturally have their own set of rules. This is not a stable and stable society. The turmoil after the end of the war is still going on. The reform of the government system has intensified the decline of public security, so even if it is summoned by the big capitalists, there is a whole process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the gate, there were three guys in suits with a cold face who came up, they let Duolin and Graf raise their hands, and then carefully I touched them all over again. It was determined that Du Lin did not bring the weapon and was taken away after Graf’s dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long corridor, they went up to the second floor. In the easternmost room, they saw Heidler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hedler at this time seems to be only fifty years old, he has a silver-gray hair, no wrinkles on his face, round face, nose Very high, the lips are very thin. He is very well maintained, red light, and may actually be older than Du Lin guessed. He wore a very expensive high-end suit, and the sword collar used silk fabric from the east, which was straight and faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His neckline and cuffs have expensive gemstone jewelry, even the buttons of the shirt are made of purple gemstones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very rich old man. The Imperial Chamber of Commerce has only thirty-six seats. These thirty-six people rule the entire empire and business. Trade has everything to do with it. From the small shops selling shoes on the roadside to the operation of the steam locomotives, they all decided. Some people laughed that although these 36 people are not emperors, they exercise the power that the emperor can have! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler is also laughing, these big men have a lot of masks, you never know if he is wearing a mask. He reached out and invited the two to sit down, even personally got up for Du Lin and Graf to pour two cups of color like gold, and put them in front of them. Both Doolin and Graf stood up. It was polite and had nothing to do with personal grievances. It’s just that compared to Graf’s slightly curved waist, Doolin’s waist is not bent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time I have people arranged to send you over, there are some words I want to talk to you." He went to the table and raised his hand. Sit down together. "I am a Guar. I know how people outside are saying about my father. I also know how some of them have hurt me. These years have improved a lot, but still some People are repeating these past events and are reluctant to face the new world and the new environment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the glass in front of him and raised his hand and took a sip. "I will never see tomorrow in the past. We should look forward and chase the sun and the light."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Guarts have been suffering, the empire has been watching us, and all the gults have been scattered to various parts of the empire. Like the sand on the beach, we can never unite. This is also the reason why our Guart people live in a bad environment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spread his hands a little and then leaned back on the luxurious heavy chair Above, "God made us a Guar, this is our pride. We should not surrender to the fate of the fate, just like the Great Patriotic War of that year. Even if we face more than ten times our enemy, we are still Dare to take up arms and fight for freedom. We should reunite. Only when all the Guars are united, can we recover the glory of the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I heard that someone built a guar The main fellowship, I am surprised, this is not a simple matter, but you have done it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin, please allow me to call you that, What do you think should be the next step in the fellowship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler’s money is not a strong wind. If you are finished, you must consider this young fellow. President of the meeting. If his thoughts can pass, then Heidler recognizes him as the president. If he only regards the fellowship as a toy, a game, then Heidler will send ways to change his own. What he needs is a handy tool, not a toy that doesn't work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is someone else, it may be difficult to find ideas and language in a short time to deal with Heidler. After all, the birth of the fellowship can be said to be due to coincidence. What emerged was that there were no prior plans and premeditated plans. But this is hard to live with Du Lin. What he has seen in his dreams is far more experienced than Heidler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was silent for a moment, sorted out the ideas, and then said very eloquently: "Mr. Heidler, thank you very much for your attention to the fellowship. I am deeply grateful to the organization that I just created, and I feel very honored."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the fellow country, my initial thoughts are very simple, I hope all the melons The Erte can stand up and fight against the unfair fate and treatment. A finger can easily break..." Du Lin stretched out his right index finger and pressed it on the table. "But when the fingers are united At that time, it will become a fist, and the fist can only hurt the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hydra appreciates the analogy of Doolin, fingers and fists, like the loose Guars and the united Guarts, and that is exactly what he needs. He nodded gratifiedly, reached out and invited, and asked Du Lin to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took back his fist and continued: "I work at the station, I think you already know it. In this short period of time, I joined. Workers' union. Workers' union gave me an unimaginable power. It was because the workers were united, so they only had..." Du Lin glanced apologetically. "I am sorry, I forgot." "..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, go on." Heidler is also a capitalist. In the face of the capitalist, he said that he would challenge the authority of the capitalist. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a deep breath and continued: "It is because the workers are united, so they have the ability to challenge the capitalists and are no longer subject to The capitalists are cruelly exploiting. And we, the Guartes, are actually the same. When we are scattered, the Ogildinians and the Empire do not need to consider our rights, because we are just scattered sand. Only our close unity Together, let them see our strength and recall the defeats encountered in the War of the Guate Kingdom, they will face us and give us the respect we deserve."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People like to say the word decent, decent is never given to you by others, nor is it born at birth, all decent and awe and glory are all won by themselves. When Du Lin said that he had a big circle in his eyes, he had a lot of experience and sentiment. Didn't everything he experienced really explain what Du Lin said was correct? If there are not a few ups and downs, how can he become a legend in people's mouth and win the respect and hostility of the Ogildinians? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first step we have to do is to be truly like a family. All members are our brothers and sisters. We must take care of everyone. Give them the benefits and power they deserve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second step, we have to make our voice in the community, let all the Odins Let all other races let the empire know that we are not victims of silence, and we also have a day to call out our voices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Third Ministry, to expand the influence, the fellowships should not be confined to a city like Tyne, the fellowships should be spread all over the country, or even the whole world! All the Guarts are our brothers and sisters, and we should all be taken care of and enjoyed by us. To welfare, and treatment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
