			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategy of the Minister of Justice can not only be applied to this matter, but in fact, it can be used in the face of many problems, if this idea is placed in Du In the world of Lin Meng's dream, it can be described by four words, called "Wei Wei Zhao." Of course, the people and wisdom here can't use a simple word or two to condense the idea of ​​writing a paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it proves that the patent in Du Lin’s hands is illegal, or proves that he violated the Anti-Monopoly Law and the Anti-Industry Manipulation Act, The results are the same. Du Lin’s hands-on patents related to the insurance business will be ineffective, and the industry labeling and access systems applied by the two banks will continue to be implemented. Du Lin will not only lose the patent in his hand, but will always be restricted to the door, and it will never be possible to enter the industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial central bank disgusted others many times, this time finally being disgusted by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The executive director nodded and regained his gaze. He looked at other directors and said calmly, "We can’t put all the focus in dealing with Du In Lin’s prosecution and counterclaim, this is definitely an unreliable choice. We will take on more risks, so I have an idea.” He said that when he saw here, he saw two executive directors sitting next to him. Chang and other directors, everyone made the same judgment through their eyes and subtle expressions, he continued. "We need to continue to contact Du Lin. Although he has mastered this patent, it does not mean that he can The whole market swallowed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gentle, this is a market of 240 million people, even if only 10% of people participate in this In the business, it is not what Du Lin can do alone, which provides the necessary conditions for our next cooperation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made it directly Decided, "The Ministry of Justice immediately began preparing materials and contending I was able to beat him in court, and I needed the Public Relations Department to set up an emergency team to try to contact Du Lin and test whether he could obtain a patent from his hands..."<br /><br />&nbsp; The director has made a number of arrangements, including letting some members who have a certain social influence and network of relationships, to contact those big people who can be concerned with these things, to see if they can continue That famous saying - "Decisive wins will always be outside the court" will continue. The top-down administrative intervention is always much simpler than the lawsuit, because there is something called “policy” that can often change the pattern in a certain business area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, it also reflects the network of human relations that the imperial central bank can be called a horror. Each member of the board of directors represents a huge network of relationships and radiates to the level of society. From the cabinet members of the cabinet to the gangsters of secretly selling grimace mushrooms in a city alley, these people have a way to contact them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are capitalists often robbed by banks and not willing to offend them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are also in this huge network, it’s not clear what the bank’s bottoms never know what it means, and that’s exactly what Maggs is. Vigilant, and has been pressing the main reason for the imperialist central bank. At that time, he forced them to give these businessmen a chance. These merchants immediately became the bankers and seized the opportunity of a thousand years to create a monster in financial history. It's not that simple now to get this monster back into a pet dog or to put it back in a cage, unless a civil war is waged for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost and result of the civil war can be unbearable, even if Maggs can’t, so the two sides can only compete in a very peaceful way. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very special temporary meeting. Just to take advantage of this opportunity, the financial report of the first half of the board was disclosed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of ordinary people think that banks are just banks. They have nothing to do with anything other than money. In fact, this is a very wrong one. The idea, though, is very popular among the ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banking industry is only a conceptual term. In fact, the bank’s work is all-encompassing, with loans, short-term lending and long-term investment as the main ways to profit. . The former is well understood. Short-term borrowing refers to when a company encounters a financial risk that is unprepared and unplanned. In order to improve its ability to resist risks or have sufficient funds to survive the current difficulties before the settlement date, they will Short-term lending can be proposed to banks. Borrowing is also a kind of loan behavior. Short-term loans are often between three days and half a month, and interest is much higher than other loans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interest rate of the imperial central bank for short-term borrowing is about 2%. This interest is not calculated on a monthly basis and is calculated on a daily basis. This business looks a lot like robbery, but in fact it is indeed a business of bank robbery. In addition to returning the principal in three or five days or a week, it must pay at least 10% interest, absolutely enough. It’s a robbery, and it’s scary compared to some small local loan sharks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why not make a loan? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loans have lower interest rates and can operate for more time, which seems to be more cost-effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the problem is that the bank’s process of issuing loans is too long, especially when the huge amount of loan business involves higher risks, and banks often prepare for a survey. Knowing whether the company can have the corresponding collateral and subsequent repayment ability, and finally can decide whether to lend. Many companies can't afford such a long time, even without the ability to lend, they can only choose to be legally robbed by the bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this involves another question. How does short-term lending guarantee that the money will not become bad debts? There are many ways for banks in this regard, the most common Like the line that Perito has done for the western insurance company, the money is always in the bank, and the cash is not allowed to be cashed if it is not allowed. The bank will pay close attention to the money. When the bank thinks that there is an unplanned risk, they The funds will be actively frozen to ensure that their interests will not be damaged. As to whether other people’s interests will be affected as a result, it has nothing to do with the bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the rest, it is the investment. Buying a large area of ​​the farm is the bank’s favorite investment method, there is almost no risk and these industries will rise every year. Many international hedge funds have invested a lot of money in this area to buy farms and pastures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first half of the financial report ended, today’s board is basically over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Director Long let other people meet, leaving the two ministers of the public relations department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin’s business is very important. If you have other public relations tasks in the near future and hand it over to others, I need you to go and Lin talks." The executive director played the ashes in the bomb and looked at the two public relations ministers standing next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two public relations ministers are all women, they are very beautiful, and their temperament for a long time in the high position, absolutely can not let anyone ignore their presence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people know how to use their strengths to go further in the mall, of course, there are many people who are arrogant and unwilling to go to the finish line by taking shortcuts. It's hard to say who is right and who is wrong. In this complex society, you can actually survive, and at least let yourself feel that you are living very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relying on these two ministers, the imperial central bank has overcome many difficulties, and women have a unique advantage in this respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are twins, and this advantage has been magnified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of strategy do we need to develop with Du Lin?", speaking to the older sister, in order to distinguish between the two sisters, they will be in different ears at work. Wear earrings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man wrapped his wrapper. When he was young, he didn’t have this kind of action. When he encountered a problem, he wrapped his mouth. Maybe when people are old, they will do it. "I'm not sure what strategy to use to capture Doolin, which requires you to grasp. Whether it is tough or weak, whether to use money, or anything else, it is up to you. I can give you the highest level. Authorization, you can mobilize most of our resources, but I wake up, money is useless to him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has a lot of money, more To the point where he may not feel anything about money, this old man is very empathetic. For him, the concept and meaning of money has been blurred to the utmost extent. He has not even cared about how many balances in his account for more than a decade, nor does he care about how much dividend he can get each year. For the poor, it may be the whole thing of a family. After waiting for a certain level, it becomes the least important thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the two girls and lowered his voice. "If you can convince Doolin to give up the patent, even if it is only part of it, your future life will live." In the most exciting place, do you understand what I mean?", he emphasized, "I don't need his authorization, he is part of the ownership of this patent, can you understand what I am?!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sisters nodded and the old man waved. "You have to concentrate on doing this during this time. You don't need to worry about other problems. If necessary, you can Our sincerity is shown to Du Lin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man shook his head after the two sisters left, and the authorization was not at all safe, once Du Lin decided to withdraw the authorization - - Of course, all of this is in the case that their counterclaims are invalid, then the profits and benefits they get from being authorized and working hard will eventually be cheaper to Doolin, which he cannot tolerate, and the true core of the board. , these principles Long it will not agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only after obtaining a certain percentage of patent rights can this situation be eliminated, which is also a big problem that needs to be solved next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin is willing to split a part of the transfer to the Imperial Bank, how much is he willing to split? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is unknown! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, when Du Lin was watching the team at Adams’s team in Oak Bay’s villa, Kevin walked away from the door with a cane. When he came in, he shrugged. "A bad news and a good news, gentlemen, which one do you want to hear first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others look at it Dooling, Du Lin licked his temple. "I hope that your bad news will not be too bad. Let me talk about the news that we all hate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai Text took two subpoenas from the carry-on documents and threw them on the table. "The imperial central bank submitted two indictments to the Supreme Court of the Empire this morning, suing the patent office for providing you with a patent certificate and prosecuting You have violated the Anti-Monopoly Law and the Anti-Industry Manipulation Act."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin snorted, this is what he expected, if the Empire Central Bank Nothing is news, "So good news?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The good news is that they The behavior has already angered the Justice Department." Kevin went to the bar and poured a glass of wine for himself, then sat down next to Du Lin. "The highest commander of the Ministry of Justice was a little angry this morning. I can see that he is very angry. In the prosecution of the Imperial Bank’s patent office, the Ministry of Justice also brought the court together.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“So?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the judicial system is more inclined to win the lawsuit. Although they will not obviously give us any help, but on some small issues, we can get more convenience." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin said that Adams just clicked, "If this is the case, our court strategy will be revised."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the law of the Empire, the life-long judge should be absolutely neutral, or even not in the judicial system. The problem is that when an old man works in a system for a lifetime, and After getting old, I got the highest of this system. Reputation, he may complete and the system out of a relationship? The answer is impossible, and he will have a special feeling for the system anyway. He may not squint and say something, but it can still be done by providing some small, insignificant conveniences, but it is these conveniences that are enough to make a huge change in the outcome of a court debate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
