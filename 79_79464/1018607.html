			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Buddha does not know that the information of these two individuals is not discovered by the children. The children’s ability is not enough to find two professional training personnel. The infiltration, so that they really exposed their whereabouts is the owner of the house where they live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not disturb others to expose themselves, they and the owner of this best-looking dwelling house - a middle-aged coward who had a red nose and blood In a transaction, he looks awkward and his family is chaotic. The days without women are not so pleasant. The two security committeeers gave the middle-aged man twenty dollars and told him that he would only occupy his house for three days. He could return to live at night, but only on the first floor. At the same time, they also told the man not to disclose their information, they want to surprise their friends who are about to pass the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, they did not even consider to temporarily tie this middle-aged man, but here is a small town, more than 20,000 people in the town look It seems that there are quite a lot of them. In fact, there are so many. The splitting and splitting points are probably less than 5,000 families. Almost everyone is very familiar with each other. Once the middle-aged man has been missing for two or three days, there will definitely be a local sheriff to see what happened here. People who like to gossip are not only in developed areas, but also here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not as good as spending money to shut him up and continue to let him wander around the town, just like nothing happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have a good idea. Middle-aged men are also willing to keep their mouths shut, but all three of them ignore one thing. One middle-aged lost his wife and no children. What kind of activity hobbies do men usually have? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this middle-aged man has a good job and income and lives in a developed city, he may have some healthier social activities, such as Helping the girls who are facing difficulties, or letting those skilled women continue to delve into their skills, can't find some "doctors" who can cure their own inflation problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here is a small town, a remote town in the west, there are no technical women here, no need for money to save their lives. The girl, not even the doctor who is good at letting those who are inflated become inflated, there is only wine, and jokes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who got twenty pieces immediately went to do what he loved most and drank. In the past, his income relied entirely on casual workers to earn pocket money. He had his own farmland and was able to maintain his life. Now that he has money, he should drink it, so he went to his favorite bar, asked for two bottles of high-end wine worth up to five, and the world where friends drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone was very curious to ask him if he had dug up gold from the ground, or where he did a bad vote, but he laughed. Telling his friends, there are two stupid people coming from the city to rent the second floor of his house, three days, twenty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably an enviable good fortune in peacetime, but at the command of Doolin, this is a very important message in the eyes of the mind, in order to avoid The entrance and exit of adults caused the attention of the two stupid mouths in the opposite side of the hotel. They chose to let the children tell Du Lin and his friends about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the boss sitting at the counter did not return to the small door behind him. His attention was completely ridiculous on TV. The plot is attracted, and I laugh from time to time for a while, laughing makes people scalp numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dudu nodded, one hand inserted into the pocket and walked out from the back door, outside the back door was a simple alley, wooden fence to the building It is separated from the other side of the mud and the garbage. After he passed through four buildings, he wandered around the road and slowly walked to the house opposite the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a back door here, all of them look around, the wrists are slightly shaken, and a blade with two inches long slides out from behind the wrist. , he was caught between the two fingers. As he carried the doorknob, he inserted the blade through the door and gently swayed it. When he felt some resistance and slowly increased his strength, the feeling in his hand told him that the door was open. He gently pulled the door open, took off his shoes and turned to enter the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pistol inserted in the holster has been taken in his hand. He opened the insurance and carefully examined the first floor of the room, but did not find anything. . Before he went up the second floor, he picked up a dirty furry toy on the ground, frowned slightly, and put it back on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This half-human toy exudes a smell that makes him feel sick, no doubt, it is the breath that men can make, combined To his guess, his face changed color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This damn homeowner is definitely a pervert! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his gaze to a dilapidated sofa, but there was a pillow here. He took the pillow up and held the gun on the second floor. Just on the second floor, he heard the sound of the second room door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know where there is a phone call in the town?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When we came in, we were in town There is a grocery store at the gate, there seems to be a phone call."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? I have to look at it, I have to report it to them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sound of the door lock being twisted, and it is clear that one of the two men is leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you let Dufu think about something too complicated, he may not be very good at it, but if he wants him to choose the most suitable speed in the battle The program, then he is definitely very good. When the reed of the door lock was twisted to the end to make some rusting metal friction, the Buddha made a decision. Two people, leaving one is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who opened the door still had a smile on his face. His eyes were completely concentrated in the room, and he did not notice the Buddha standing on the edge of the corridor. Dufo did not give him any chance to directly pull the pillow in front of the muzzle and continually pull the trigger. The four bullets instantly tore the wet pillows, and the yellowed inside lost the fluffy down. The soldier standing in the corridor shook a few times and plopped down on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the four bullets hit his neck, and the other three hit him on the chest, so that the lethality is enough to make him even If you can't say it, wait for the coming of death. There are many people who say that they should aim at their heads when shooting. In fact, this is a wrong statement that can't be mistaken. It is more likely to be hit than the head of the head. The purpose of shooting the human body is nothing more than two kinds, one is to limit the action, the other is to kill the other side, but these are not enough to make people aim at the target's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart or the main organs or intestines, as long as they are not treated for a short period of time, there is no need for rescue in about two minutes to three minutes. As for restrictive action, the legs are a very good goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fallen voice and gunshots alarmed another person in the room. The guy immediately pulled out the gun and squatted at the door and aimed at the door. His forehead began to sweat, except for a pair of legs that twitched from time to time. I can't see anything, I can't hear anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshots were weakened after passing the pillow, and the doors and windows in this room were closed and did not pass outside the room, walking on the road Pedestrians don't even know that there has just been a murder in a place where their diameter is less than ten meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quiet space can make some people relax, but also can make some people nervous, the people in the room are in the air for three minutes, the double twitching double After the legs were no longer moving, the pressure in the heart increased sharply and they could not bear to shout. "Who is, we are agents of the Imperial Security Commission, are performing tasks, and your actions have seriously violated imperial law..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he heard a crisp metal vibrate from the door, which was the sound of a well-known brand lighter when the lid was opened, about five seconds. After that, a lit pillow was thrown in from the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location is very awkward, this pillow fell on the other side of the bed, and soon ignited the quilt on the bed, the flame is getting bigger and bigger, the people in the room But did not dare to put out these flames. Because he is very clear, as long as he makes any sound, there may be a gun outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bean's sweat hangs down his side, he wipes the sweat from his face, slows down and slowly gets up, now There are two ways to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chongjie and the gunman decided to fight, or broke the window and jumped out of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second floor, not high, and will not be fatally hurt beyond jumping out. As long as he jumps out, he will surely alarm the local sheriff. . By then he will be able to get help from the locals, this gunman can never run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is not sure if the guy will suddenly shoot at him when he breaks the window, people’s fear of the unknown is much higher than the fear of knowing It is this kind of uncertainty that makes him struggle constantly and makes decisions difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he has moved to the edge of the window, the whole bed is burning, but there is still no sound at the door. He knows that he can’t wait any longer, he doesn’t want to be Burned alive, and did not want to be killed as soon as he went out with his companion. He picked up the telescope on the table and slammed it into the window. The broken glass sound is like a signal from the firing gun. He sits on the table with his legs on his ass and falls out of the window as soon as he turns over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
