			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain immediately took his eyes back. "Yes, yes, the two officers, I am the head of the fleet...", the captain took out the shirt The cigarette in the pocket went over and was pushed away by two soldiers when not near. This action made the captain feel faint, because it was different from before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shipping companies they belong to are not ordinary ordinary companies. From top to bottom, there are more than one hundred freighters running in the sea, and one in the whole empire. In the sea, this piece has great prestige. The company's board of directors and the Navy's top management maintain a close relationship throughout the year. It is said that the Navy's high-level family members are on the company's board of directors to ensure that the company will not be deliberately killed by the Navy during the transportation process. And every year, the company will donate no less than 500,000 yuan as a "patriotic donation" to the navy. The relationship between the two sides has always been very harmonious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no previous encounter with a similar boarding check, but most of the time it was just a passing, the soldiers who boarded the ship checked the smoke here, and The sailors have played a few cards, and then they will soon leave with the local products. They have never been so different from today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain’s brain is still slowly thinking, and one of the soldiers showed him the “Imperial Sea Defence Inspection Notice”, “according to the latest requirements of the Imperial Ministry of Defense. The West Coast will strictly crack down on various smuggling activities. Please inform the staff of the other two ships to concentrate on their respective decks and cooperate with our inspection work. If there is any wrong behavior, we think that you are fighting against us. We have the power to sink your ship!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain’s gaze rests on the notice with the Imperial Ministry of Defense, the Imperial Naval Headquarters, and the Imperial West Line. The seal of the Navy headquarters and a series of signatures. It can be seen that the Imperial Navy attaches great importance to this notice. It is now difficult to see the seal of the Imperial Army from the notice of the Navy, but it actually exists in this notice! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain’s hand handing over the smoke was collected, able to be the captain, and still the team leader, relying on his physical fitness, his experience. He made a quick decision and nodded with a smile. "No problem, no problem at all. I will let them cooperate with the actions of the Imperial Navy. Can I contact them in the control room?" He leaned sideways and tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two soldiers did not stop him, he immediately returned to the control room and began to try to contact the nearby telegraph office by radio, and soon after switching on to the telegraph office To the headquarters of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person answering the phone is the person in charge of the company's emergency handling office. If the ship is resistant to the sea, no one can tell what the situation will be. Therefore, every ship shipping company has such a departmental mechanism to deal with any sudden action. The situation is given and the most appropriate treatment is given. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain said what he had encountered and what he was worried about, silenced for a moment in the receiver, and gave him an answer that shocked him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, most newspapers in the empire were printed again, and people’s eyes have begun to shift from Doolin’s assassination to several big stars. The scandal, but this day's news once again brought people's attention to the other side of the Doolin assassination case, the Cape family and the sacred consortium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to newspaper reports, just yesterday, when the Navy of the West Coast routinely prevented smuggling and sampling of passing ships, it discovered three ships from the federal destination. It is a smuggling ship in the northernmost winter port of the empire. These smuggled ships smuggled a large amount of goods from the Federation. What is even more unexpected is that the owner of the goods is actually the prestigious Trident Heavy Industry of the Empire. The amount involved is as high as 7 million! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the trial of the private squad, the leader of the smuggling fleet provided even more striking insider, and every two months, Trident Heavy Industries would ask them to smuggle one The goods with the same value are sneaked from the federal government, and it has been no less than 60 times since it was discovered! This will be the smuggling case in which the empire has the highest value of smuggled goods, the longest time span, the widest number of people involved, and the highest social status in the history of the empire! The newspaper also disclosed that the Imperial Ministry of Justice is planning to investigate and prosecute shipping companies and Sangong Heavy Industries. In particular, Sangong Heavy Industries has been required to suspend production and seal all material warehouses. Something to be checked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message took less than two hours, and the stock of Trident Heavy Industries was directly swayed. At the same time, all the transactions in the three major transactions were stopped, and the stock was also closed. Being temporarily removed from the trading card, Xie Lisi Street was mourning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accident of Sangong Heavy Industries has triggered a related listed company, and 27 stocks related to the Shengge Group have plummeted at the same time, plus Sangong Heavy Industry. Twenty-eight stocks evaporated 710 million yuan in the morning, which led to the first collapse of the Imperial Industrial Index in the New Year. The entire industry is facing a huge crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysts believe that the illegal behavior of Trident Heavy Industry is probably not a case. Once Trident Heavy Industry can't face the current investigation, it is determined that there are a large number of illegal facts, and it is very likely that it will affect other heavy industry. Each of the heavy industry enterprises issued a statement to ensure that the company does not have any illegal acts, and strongly condemns the shameful behavior of Sangong Heavy Industry in order to obtain huge profits and trample on the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon that day, old Cappe suddenly stunned and was sent to St. Mathil Hospital for rescue. The Cape family has become a pot of wheat, a hymn. The consortium staff also broke the inside story of the fierce quarrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the West, Du Lin put down the newspaper in his hand, and Magus’s shot was much faster than he thought, which may be fast with the hymn consortium. The reaction pulls up the stock price and has a direct relationship with people's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No news hotspot will last for too long, and when this lawsuit on his body has not yet come to fruition, public opinion tends to him, but also Not exactly the one-sided situation. The responding family of the Cape bought a large number of newspapers for their continued whitewashing, and they also discovered the significance of those social activists, and bought a large number of social activists who represented the direction of public opinion for their activities. Coupled with a series of scandals of three movie stars in the past few days, the focus of public opinion has begun to turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once this matter has subsided, it will take more effort to mobilize the support of public opinion again, and repeated incitement of public opinion will also have negative effects. People will feel bored, tired, and even too lazy to pay attention to this matter. Once the heat is reduced, the follow-up plan will have a fatal impact. The hymn community's means are simple and effective, replacing the past news with new hotspots. They may pay a lot for it, but all the efforts are worthwhile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just didn’t expect Magus to take the shot. It’s a thunder blow. I just climbed from the quagmire to the shore’s hymn consortium, once again. Do your best in the quagmire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, it’s not that simple to get rid of the current predicament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is somewhat different from Maggs’ original plan. Magus hopes to involve more capitalists... and suddenly Du Lin’s faint guess What happened to it, which gave him a moment of horror. Because he found that the target of Magus seemed to be all capitalists, but the actual spearhead pointed to the stubborn forces left by the empire - the northern aristocracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrats in the north still maintained the past faction. They bought all the land on their own territory. The people who lived on their own territory still referred to these people as nobles. There was almost no change in the past. In the territory of these nobles, people's lives and past changes are not too great. From the problem of economic construction in the north, it has been far behind the south. It seems that there is a force that is controlling the "innovation" force in the north, letting the north gradually And the other places have made a huge difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This power is called "noble"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Marggs really wants to deal with is not the capitalist and capitalist forces. What he hides under all the surface is to deal with the legacy of the aristocracy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the current situation, the northern aristocratic forces "separated" the northern part of the empire through a way that was not easily discovered by people, where they made their own The system, anyone who wants to make a change to the current situation in the North, can only end up with sand. If you do not destroy these nobles and their systems, the empire will never be called complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to the Cape family is just the ringtone of the game. From the current situation, the Cappe family, who is facing difficulties, wants to stand up as soon as possible. Must rely on the power of other nobles, because Magus is also a noble, but also a big aristocracy. The relationship between these big nobility networks is layered and intricate. Maybe anyone and anyone has a good relationship with Magus. If you want to move Magus? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the Capé family really did this, they really fell into the trap of Magus, because "conspiracy" and "covering" were as offensive The law of the empire... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought of some things that happened before. For example, he once told Magus that officials were corroded by capital power and gave a green light to the capitalist’s investment. Caused the loss of imperial property and so on. At that time, Magus seemed to be very dissatisfied with the practices of these officials. He also mentioned with Du Lin that he had an idea and wanted to legislate to constrain the issue of too close contact between officials and capitalists. At that time, Du Lin put forward an idea, set up a new department, and legislated to pave the way for this department. The ultimate goal was to find those bastard officials who would not hesitate to sell national interests and people's interests for the benefit and put them in jail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus also smiled and said that not only officials must catch, but those who deliver benefits should also catch... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
