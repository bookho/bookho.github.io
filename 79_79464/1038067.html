			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federer’s press conference played a key role, especially at the launch of a real victim, Amon, who talked about himself. The encounter has put the whole world in an anger state. It is already in the ninth century AD. The whole world has almost entered the civilized society. Actually, there are so despicable things that can really shake the society. The industrial sector shares on Xie Lisi Street suffered the first drop in three years, and the Imperial Industrial Index fell more than 7%. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people refer to the current industrial sector as "blood flowers", that is, the blood of these slaves is poured out of the fast-growing bright flowers, in these colorful colors Under the intoxicating results, almost filled the bodies of slaves from all over the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The listed companies in the industrial sector continue to declare their innocence, but the community has begun to pay attention to this matter, it is not important to be innocent, important public opinion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is also someone who is sought after, that is Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first unbearable slavery in a modern civilized society, Mr. Doolin was the first mine owner to grant slave freedom in the West. The behavior and his noble morality are like the last piece of fig leaf of the empire, like the last decent of the whole society. In this barbaric society, at least one other person warms everyone like the light. This is a miracle and something that people need. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr. Doolin became the darling of public opinion again. Many people wanted to interview Mr. Doolin and asked him when he saw these slaves living in despair. What kind of feelings do they have in their hearts, and after such psychological struggles, they have made such a great move, even the church has ran out to give Du Lin a "Light of the Knights of the Cross" to recognize Du Lin in saving humanity. The outstanding contribution made on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is equal, I have not only said this once!", Du Lin talked about the camera, Nasha sat on him On the left hand side, this news is too big, so as the chairman of the leading group of Empire Star Media, a visual media group, Nasha came to the West to interview Du Lin with the film crew as the next empire star. The main content of the tape. After all, people are paying attention to this one now. No matter whether those customers really know what is going on inside, they all want to see Du Lin appear on the screen and listen to him to say something, so as not to let himself gradually in the mainstream society. Outdated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha Bilin last saw her more confidence, a woman or a man, and actually belonged to an "emotional" creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how good a man is, as long as he lacks self-confidence, he will give others a decadent feeling, just like the garbage on the roadside It seems a waste of time. People are always talking about inner beauty and spiritual beauty, but in this fast-paced modern society, everyone is overwhelmed by heavy burdens. Who still has time to pay attention to whether a person’s inner being is true? nice. They tend to simply evaluate a person through appearance, and then regard this evaluation as reasonable and respected to the people around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the inner beauty is in the face of a society that looks like a non-mainstream, this may also be an instinct for animals, simple and intuitive external Forever more than the "important" inside, when females choose mating objects, they will never consider whether the ugly males have inner beauty. They only need a male who looks majestic and can ride horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company’s increasing sales and its share of the various classes in society have made Nasha very angry. The little girl is a little older than Du Lin, wearing a neutral dress. It looks like a successful social celebrity. She is more dazzling than before, a confident smile is always the most perfect makeup, she grinned at Du Lin, smiled and nodded from time to time, as if every word Du Lin said is correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is of course, and Du Lin’s words are definitely correct, including Doolin’s own thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted his wrist and made a sliding little movement with his fingers, facing the camera without any market. "My father told me when I was young." To respect life, this is not a kind of etiquette, but an attitude of survival. When we respect others, we are respecting ourselves. There is nothing in this world that is more precious than life, and no one has the power to trample on it. The dignity and life of others, I don't want to see those suffering people continue to suffer in despair, so I broke the rules that have always existed in the West, and I stood up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I am not afraid of any challenges and treatments that are different from others, because I have been asking myself, torture my conscience...", Du Lin corrected his sitting position, his left hand pressed on his chest, he straight Looking at the camera, the expression is sacred and serious. "If I do this, I will not be able to eat, can't sleep? In the years to come, will my heart be suffering?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his arm and shook his index finger. "No, I think I am right, because I saved some people who should not be treated like this. If I don't do this, I will feel my heart is suffering. God always tells We should not hurt others for selfish purposes, we must learn tolerance and kindness. I feel that I have done it, and I have not violated my conscience. Making these things will make me feel happy. I think this is the revelation that God has given me. , tell me that I am not wrong!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The photographer is a believer in the church, and his assistant is also, at this time he looked up at the assistants around him, low Asked, "Does God say this? In the first few chapters, why don't I remember God saying this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His assistant After thinking for a while, then I opened the shrinking version of the holy instrument that I carried with me. I couldn’t find a similar word for a long time. He stuttered. "It may be that we usually read it carefully. After the recording is over, we can Ask the pastor "In fact, even if they did not go, because the pastor did not read these words from any one holy instruments, which is to say Turin. Nasha took a breath, she was watching Du Lin, she really learned a lot of things from Doolin, many things It is something she can't even learn in her books, such as shamelessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not Nasha’s curse on Du Lin in her heart. For any successful person, shamelessness is a must for them. Du Lin is not a shame. There is also an exaggerated appeal. When the shamelessness and appeal are reflected in one person, what he said, even if you feel very exaggerated, will unconsciously start to be suspicious, perhaps he is telling the truth. What about it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, now the whole society is paying attention to these tragedies in the west. What do you think we should do next, in order to be able to recover in some respects? Let us derogate from the decent and let the empire be shamed?", Nasha glanced at the Taiwanese in hand. These problems were all drafted before the recording. I originally needed Du Lin in this Taiwanese, but Du Lin told Nasha that she would not be able to deal with the problem of being too sharp and extreme. The rest of him could handle it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is perhaps another talent for Du Lin, who grew up with a mouth that can speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin squinted at the head and listened to Nasa’s question. He then slightly raised his hands and squeezed the sword collar of the dress. "Miss Nasha's question is very good. Even if you don't ask me, I will say it. Now we have three things to solve first. The first one is to investigate how many illegal implementations of slavery exist in the entire western region. The mining area, statistics show how many slaves still live in dark mines. We need to know how many people are between life and death. This is what we should do and our responsibility, not because it is a scandal. We will avoid it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
