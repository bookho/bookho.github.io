			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am making a hypothesis here, assuming that a family pays only a few dollars a month... seven dollars, you can enjoy a month without a whole day. Intermittent program pushes, from people who like to watch news programs, social programs to those that can make people happy, don't repeat, every day is different, what kind of experience is this? Just need a piece of tape to enjoy the money To dozens of discs or even hundreds of tapes, maybe people's entertainment will become easier?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doolin speaks, work People pushed a modified TV set to the stage, and people immediately attracted the TV. Du Lin went to the TV and turned on the switch. There was a silence in the display first, then a white point appeared, and it flashed until some white spots became blue, green, and red. . Then the screen flashed, and a hand-painted cartoon character with the same style as the protagonist in the short film sat on a sofa, facing a simple TV with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the cable lou, a distinctive and special meaning that can increase the audience while also allowing users to generate more Strong sense of belonging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Doolin twisted the knob on the decoder and snorted, and the crisp sound was transmitted through the microphone to the entire hall. Then people saw the screen appearing on the screen. It was the political talk show of this period of the Empire Star. Many people have already watched it. Then Du Lin twisted again. In the incredible exclamation of people, the series of the empire of the Star Empire appeared on the screen, twisted several times, and each time the knob was turned, different contents appeared. Many people are getting excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Du Lin’s words are true, it means they can enjoy more content with only a small amount of money. No one will think that saving is ugly, saving is a virtue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin walked away from the TV and walked to the edge of the host. "A TV, a signal line, no more than ten dollars a month." Even if you don’t cost more than seven dollars, you can enjoy the twenty-four-hour scrolling of ten channels with different content every day! If we calculate the maximum size of each tape for 45 minutes, every day. A TV will play the contents of three hundred and twenty tapes, and the content of nine hundred and six hundred tapes a month!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are priced for five dollars for these tapes, and the content of 48,000 pieces now costs only seven dollars." After Du Lin finished this sentence, everyone took a sigh of relief and they thought of the short end. That sentence, a cheap entertainment era, may have arrived due to the emergence of television. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others think more. If cable TV can do instant news delivery, then Du Lin’s subversion is not just as simple as a tape industry. Even the news industry will be completely subverted by the emergence of cable TV. Think about it. The news in the newspapers that people see now is almost the day before or the day before. The news broke out and was captured and then turned into text. The proofreading was printed into the hands of the newspapers, and it took at least one day. time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s seen in newspapers is actually old news, but if TV can broadcast the news directly in the shortest possible time, even if it’s just a dictation, it’s enough Let the newspaper industry shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, Du Lin personally created a mythical story of the tape industry, earned a lot of money with the Empire Star, and more importantly, he earned enough More political influence. Now, he personally subverted his pioneering industry and pushed the content forward many times. There is not only a mythical wealth, but also an unparalleled influence. When Doolin wants to express his opinions and opinions, as long as he wants, he can immediately let those who sit in front of the TV know that this influence and propaganda is terrible, and it is terrible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it’s time to ask questions, and what Du Lin needs to show is also shown, but there are definitely some details that I didn’t take care of. This is the necessity of the questioning session at the press conference. There are always some reporters who don't want to be good. You still have to bear your money to make it difficult for you, but it is precisely these people who can help the founders of the conference to find some details that they have not noticed. In fact, they also do Not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one to raise a hand is the journalist of the Irian Daily, which has almost become one of the unspoken rules in the industry. Respecting the local media will not cause journalists. Dissatisfied, but also get the goodwill of the local media. The reporter of the Irian Daily is a woman. The golden big wavy hair is one of the most popular hairstyles in recent years. The casual dress makes her look good and very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, according to what you just said, there will be three hundred and twenty rolls of tape content scrolling every day, I have a very curious here. The question, where did your content come from? Or how do you solve the problem of the content stock itself?", the female reporter raised a very sharp question, which also made other reporters temporarily close the mouth of communication. Start listening to Du Lin's answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People just looked at the exaggerated data given by Du Lin. Whatever a month, 48,000 pieces of content can be obtained for only seven dollars, completely immersed in this dreadful or exciting data, ignoring the other One thing - does Du Lin really have so much content available? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This female reporter asked a very critical question, if Du Lin could not provide so much content, then he just lied, although this will not It has any impact on the prospects of cable TV, but the wind review and image of Du Lin himself in front of the media will be seriously damaged. After all, Du Lin is an honest man who often tells the truth, this may be his first time lying! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pointed out that the female reporter was not nervous at all. "I have to say that you have raised a very critical question. I originally intended this question. I took it out and said it alone, but you came up, I explained it clearly here!", he waved at the backstage, Nasha and Jeff came out from the dark, smiled and walked On the stage, everyone who knew them showed a surprised expression. "I believe that some of you here must have known them. I am here to introduce you. This is Ms. Nasha, the Empire Star and the Empire of Stars. Chairman and largest shareholder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha owes a slight owe and then stands back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not surprisingly looks like a good person, Mr. Jeff, the sole shareholder of San Fernando boutique production company.", with Doolin Introduction, Jeff smiled slyly, and there were some whistles in the audience. The tape that prints a mountain peak and the sunken groove has always been a favorite thing for men. The price is not cheap, the content is very rich, and there are many fresh things every month, which are very popular among gentlemen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, some people have made a cry, after all, Jeff's products are not so friendly to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, hello, this is a very serious product launch. Didn’t you see that today’s protagonists are wearing formal attire and wearing a tie and collar?”, Du Lin emphasized it, but it was a pity that there was only a bigger laughter. His words were reminiscent of the protagonists who did not wear clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, okay!", he raised his hand and smiled and continued. "The lady just asked me if I have so much content. My answer is yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
