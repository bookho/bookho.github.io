			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man unconsciously took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket. Doolin’s words were not exaggerated. It’s true. This is also the current joint parliament and federation. The unanimous decision of the government, including the capitalists, consortia and even citizens in the federation, is eager to do what they can. When one thing is promoted by the whole people, the top of the tower can only design the direction and route, and cannot completely control the situation, because they can't control the spontaneous motivation of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 18th meeting of the past few years, although the content of the meeting was to discuss whether the sea area is part of the national territory, but also revealed a country from the side In the context of the entire international position, it did not play any role, even if the Empire and the Federation opposed it, and another 16 countries voted to pass the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter how strong the empire and the federation are, even if one can play ten, what about it? Others don't take you to play, isolate you, and finally don't want to bow down and take the initiative to integrate them into it? Moreover, the Federation has never implemented isolationism, and the general direction of the country has always been actively integrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discovering this, the federal policy direction and future route will begin to work harder in the international arena, and want to become super super Great powers, then there must be something that can make a difference and let others be convinced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Federation, what is something that others are not or not? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is simple, financial, and economic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the straightforward point, that is, there is money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation is the earliest open free trade market in the world and the most mature country in the financial system, which is related to the history of the Federation. Their systems and rules are far more effective and advanced than those of other countries. The powerful capital power is enough for the foreign trade of federal traders to spread all over the world. Under the premise of having such a very advantageous position, and the war in the world has gradually subsided, all countries have begun to develop the economy, and under the background of strengthening national strength, the federal government and the speaker suddenly found that they are playing with us. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, can we do the lead brothers of these backward developing countries in the world, tell them how to avoid possible mistakes in development and find the most suitable development? Ways, then let them become their younger brothers, let the federation become the "big brother" in the true sense? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once this idea was put forward, it took everyone's attention firmly. A lot of opinions from the consortium and the big capitalists came together. The federal government felt that they could try it. At the same time, they also noticed the problem of currency settlement in the process of foreign trade. The impact. If one day the countries of the world are using federal shield settlement, and even the federal shield is used in daily life, then these countries are not a problem with the federal state. ! By the time they use the federal currency, read federal books, and even feel that they are federal in their hearts... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it is exciting enough, even though this idealized solution has finally evolved into a more realistic and ironic realism plan that makes the world It is shrouded in the shadow of the federal financial order, but it is undeniable that neither idealism nor realism has anything to do with the federal government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then following the protests and voices of the "civilian" consortium, the federal government began to actively implement this plan. First, they need to resolve the contradiction between themselves and the empire. Restoring tariffs is only the first step, and then all aspects of cooperation, including financial aid for funds, are designed to solve the empire's hindrance in the process of federal system of global financial system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then after a round of development, the federal capitalists are active around the world, so that all countries in the world have learned the terrible and powerful foundation of the federal economy, and have produced Longing for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, there are indeed some things that are too smooth and expansive. However, under the joint efforts of the federal government, the joint parliament, the enthusiastic masses of the community, the big capitalists, and the big consortium, everyone does not think this will become a trouble. As long as the federal status in the international financial field is getting higher and higher, the federal government is becoming more and more important to the economic construction of each country. All the problems will not be a problem in the end, because there will be people to pay for the previous leaks. But now, a young man tells him that telling the developers and participants of this huge plan, things will not be as simple as he imagined, the old man falls into Contemplative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the cigarette in the hands of the old man was burned out. He squeezed his eyes and looked at the cigarette butt in his hand and inserted it into the ashtray. Then I looked at Doolin. "This is also the real purpose of your coming to the Federation, is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not lie, directly admitted, it was like It was when he chatted with Magus that he would not lie because he knew he could lie on Magus. The same is true for the old man. They stand at the top of the world for too long. They have encountered anything, lying and not lying. Even if they are uncertain, they will doubt it. This is not as generous as it is, but it is even more convincing to these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
