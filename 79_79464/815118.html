			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerez looked at the road to the farm and looked forward to Eastbour’s bastard coming over the truck quickly, but he did not notice, on the contrary There are four cars on the road that are coming fast. There are very few such teams on Louis Street, after all, it is a suburb. The reason why the streets in the suburbs will have names is because during the Great Patriotic War, a woman named Louis was sacrificed here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is definitely going to be dead, but this lady named Louis is not the same as the ordinary sacrificed citizen, when she was lying in the room with two wounded Imperial soldiers. She is treating the two soldiers. The federal search team searched here. Some people reported that the wounded were seen on this street. When she searched the home of Ms. Louis, she refused the federal search because she was a son-in-law at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All similar stories did not have a perfect ending, the lady was finally shot in public, and the two wounded soldiers did not escape the sacrifice. After the Great Patriotic War, in order to establish some typical examples, the empire named this unnamed street as Louis Street to pay homage and cherish the memory of those who once illumined the hearts of the people and their deeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the name of this street is, it is a remote place, there are no technical women in groups, and there is still no sweat in the cold winter. Constantly undressing sick girls, here is like the edge of all cities, poor, no one pays attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truck in the distance has already appeared, and Jerez breathed a sigh of relief and was safe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, behind him, there was a series of cars driving, and the moment when the four cars came together, Jerez’s companion suddenly Luis fell to the ground, and Piu’s message behind Jerez’s box swayed for a while before spraying the broken newspaper piece. A gunshot stunned the entire street. People who were not on the road immediately ran into the dwellings, closed the door, pulled down the curtains, and then silently waited for the gun to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the car is very fast, Jerez will rush back to the house while they hit it back, but even if there are still four men on the steps back to the house . Four cars parked outside the door of No. 71, the people in the car did not get off, they directly pulled the trigger directly against the house. The bullets easily penetrated the wooden walls that were not so thick, and the outer walls were big holes and small eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truck that was already close suddenly turned around and ran away from the outside of the city. At this time, the group of desperate people did not have the concept of "collective" and "honor". Saying that everything else is fake, only to keep your own life is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of gunshots rang, the wood chips on the outer wall of the house collapsed like snow. At the beginning, there were some counterattacks at the beginning, and soon there was no counterattack. At this time, the talents in the car quickly came down, carefully approached the house and surrounded the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat on another car parked across the road. He calmly watched the battle with a serious gap. Mengxi smiled contemptuously. "Mr. Du Lin, these civil armed forces are not our opponents at all. You don't have to take risks to the scene at all. Just look for a place to wait for the news." Major Mengxi was very happy. He found three of them yesterday. The girl of technology learned a lot of techniques, although the last slain was defeated, but the joy of the mind and the relaxation of the body made him smile a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just him, even the soldiers he brought out were the same. Don't talk about finding a woman in the military camp. It is enough to see a woman to let them relax for a few days. Whoever came up with a non-combat mission, can actually go ashore to find some girls to relax, talk about ideals and life, and get to know each other in depth, it is cool to burst! And they also understand that they can get such treatment, and all the expenses are from Mr. Doolin, so today they are also very hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time, there must be a second time, isn’t it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, a soldier ran over and told Monsi and Doolin in the car that they found it in the debris warehouse behind the house. Five bodies. Du Lin brows and immediately knows that his man was killed. He was a little annoyed with a cigarette, looking at the tentative attack and counterattacking the house, whispered, "burn the house, I will bear the trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monsi nodded and said, "Do as Mr. Doolin said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers immediately turned back, and soon they collected from the surroundings Some dry grass arrived, piled up together, and the fire began to spread immediately. The winter climate is dry, there is still a distance from the sea, and the Shanghai wind is constantly blowing, and the wooden houses are very easy to catch fire. In just ten minutes, the fire began to spread toward the house. The thick smoke spurted out of the window and ascended into the sky, like a straight stick hitting the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerez was hiding on the second floor. His smoked tears blew his face. He knew that if he didn't go out, he might be alive and dead. Anyway, it was a death. It would be better to rush out and say it. He took both pistols in his hands and took a deep breath, snorted and jumped out of the window on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he had not landed, he was hit several shots. After landing, he struggled a few times and gave up. Every time he breathed, his chest would be issued. The sound of the sputum is broken, and blood is also ejected from the nostrils. His lungs were broken down, and he could only die if he couldn't get a quick treatment. He was lying on the ground with powerlessness, looking at the sky, and regretting regrets. If you know that the group behind the idiots of Sebble is supported by the rich, he said nothing will work with Sebray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that he has been pitted by Sai Bray. This is absolutely innocent. He clearly did not offend anyone, but he was found by Sebble and then threw a thunder. Wrapped in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would like to see Seebray again, and ask if the bastard is so interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before he died, he turned his head to the side and saw a young man from the author in the car across the road. After the young man’s indifferent eyes touched his godless eyes, he moved away. He squeezed a weird smile and swallowed the last breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minutes, all Jerez’s associates jumped out of the house, the fire in the house was getting bigger and bigger, and it’s really only a dead end without going out, but It may not be alive if you rush out. The members of the smuggling gang, which successively rushed out, fell one by one on the ladder outside the gate. In less than a minute, the gunfire completely subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistle of the distant fire truck and the siren of the police car have already sounded, and soon five cars disappeared into the city, leaving only the body of one place. And a burning house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was such a bad case in the Montreux area that affected the stability of the city. The situation of tourists leaving early has already occurred. The City Hall requested that the case be thoroughly investigated immediately and as soon as possible. Solve the case. The clues collected by the police at the location of the crime and the information of the deceased, they are more inclined to be a gang of smuggling gangs. Jerez’s reputation is still loud in Montreux. The only uncertainty is that this guy is offended. Who, or who wants to get rid of him, has a hatred for the territory and resources in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
