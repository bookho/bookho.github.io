			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you are right, but some things are not so easy to do." Arthur took a sip of Buddha and gave him a happy land, immediately Realize that this may be the top goods, because he is inexplicably relaxed, and there are hundreds of pieces in this land. Although he can afford it, he can give it to others like this, he can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Buddha looks like a very, very rich family child, with a frivolous look, he lifts his chin slightly, bites the land with his teeth, sounds Squeezed out from the gap in the teeth. "What can't you do? You said that I told you yesterday? Hehe!" Hearing that he was laughing, Arthur could hear the contempt and contempt in laughter, which made He thought that he had treated people who were not as good as himself, and he was a little annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for Arthur to attack, all Buddhas continue to say: "If you don't believe it, it doesn't matter to you anyway."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, Arthur met with the Buddha, and all the Buddhas sent a bottle of wine for free. This kind of behavior deeply stimulated Arthur. I feel that I am the most dazzling Arthur in the field. How can I be willing to be trampled on my face? So he also sent a bottle of wine to each room at the table, even better than the Buddha's wine. Next, it seems to be an epic war for dignity and glory. In the end, the Buddha gave two free-skilled women to each table to compete for the winner and become the winner of the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally Arthur should be very angry, after all, a stranger stepping on his face in his most familiar entertainment venue became a "big celebrity", which is inexplicable He doesn't hate the Buddha, he even "likes" him - not the kind of love that goes beyond friendship, but he finally sees a ruin that is more defeated than himself, which makes him feel like he has encountered a rare Confidant, couldn't help but sit next to the Buddha with a glass of wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. John has always said that he is a ruined family, saying that he is not doing business, saying that he is a waste, saying that he is not even as good as waste. He will not do anything but spend money. But today he witnessed himself not the most garbage, because there is a person who is more junk than him. This kind of taste will definitely be wrong, this is also a garbage, a waste, a loser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two have the same taste, say luxury living, say how to spend money, talk about women, and finally they become good friends. When drinking and drinking half drunk, Arthur asked why Buddha would come to the emperor. He told him that he was doing something for his father, contacting some people, and loosening something by the way. In short, in Arthur’s view, this rubbish is really more rubbish than himself. What he can say can’t be said. What makes him feel cold and sweaty is the “Joe” and his family. I plan to contact more. The power of the capital took a piece of meat from the George family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there was everything that happened during the day, Arthur was really anxious, and there was a sense of urgency in which he had mastered the secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Arthur was soft on the sofa, smiling silly, and spit a smog. "I wanted to tell you something, I didn't expect you to bring it." This thing, the atmosphere has been destroyed by you.", his speech speed is not fast, a little fuzzy, and laughed after finishing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clear flash in the eyes of Buddha, the land of his hand is processed, only the first two are true parasitic, behind All are tobacco leaves. In this case, even if the paper is burned, Arthur will not notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say, let me be happy." From the way of speaking and expression, the Buddha seems to be as much as Arthur, even The reaction has become full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left can create a happy mood, let people ignore things, make thinking slower, and not let people lose even thinking and instinct. Arthur quickly told his Buddha about his distress in accordance with his lines and scripts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father is sick in bed, and his brothers and sisters in the family put their minds on the infighting, resulting in a decline in the performance of the family industry, if it can not be resolved This problem, then it is very likely that the family industry will go bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has shaped himself into the only person in the family, but even then he may have to live on the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to him, he asked him, "Do you love your father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Love?", Arthur's eyes appeared a brief confusion, and then nodded affirmatively, "I love him more than anything in this world!", what can be said, what can not be said, his heart is still very clearly. Although in the eyes of others, he is a loser, a waste, a garbage that only knows how to eat, drink, and play, but he does not perform well, at least often go to the manor to "see" Mr. John. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in front of this garbage that is more junk than himself, he can't show that he has scum ingredients, so he loves his father very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha raised his hand on his shoulder and put it in his ear, whispered: "That's good, I love me too." Father. Since you love your father, can you understand his current anger and pain? You should help him to get rid of all this, whether it is anger or pain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The next time, the Buddha was playing on the side, Arthur frowned and sat in the corner, and the land was thrown by him and threw it on the table. The words of the Buddha are like the magic sounds from hell, and they have been echoing in his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first he didn’t understand what Buddha meant and what was liberation, but with his serious thoughts, he finally understood. Unconsciously, he took off his jacket and felt the sultry heat in the room. He went to the balcony and opened the floor-to-ceiling window and walked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge neon lights flashed on his head, and the sound of pleasure was faintly heard in the surrounding windows. The sweat on his body was even more, and his face was also Become serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He realized that perhaps this is a very shit idea, but it is a bit more attractive. As the Buddha said, if Mr. John knows about him and his family's current situation, he must be angry. At the same time, he can't wake up. He can only suffer in the darkness and go to find a one that may never be exported. The end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him live so angry and painful, perhaps the best way to free him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have saved a part of the family business, and there is still a chance to reinvigorate, and Mr. John does not need to suffer any more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licked his fist and rubbed his palms on his trousers. After returning to the room, he did not alarm the Buddha. He went straight out of the door of the private room and returned to his villa after buying the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat on the sofa in the lobby, without turning on the light, surrounded by darkness, which gave him a feeling of fear. From the moment he was born, his life is full of light. He seems to feel that he can feel the feelings of Mr. John. In the face of the infinite endlessness of the darkness that surrounds and drowns himself, if someone can bring himself out of this world, he will be grateful to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur silently went to the study that had never been used in the business, pushed an organ, and stepped into the hidden cellar. He opened a suitcase in the rudiment cellar with a complete set of custom pistols. More bullets, more powerful, and more... nice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He skillfully picked up the accessories and assembled them silently. When he pushed the reaction chamber with the twin crystal into the pistol grip and opened the insurance, he felt the handle passed. After the heat came, he silently returned to the villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long dryness of the night, in the infinite darkness, he ushered in the first sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should do something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin got the feedback from Dufo and didn’t care about it anymore. He still needs to sit in the city of Otis to prevent some people from doing what they should not have. thought. As Alice said, this is a city full of criminals, but the criminals put on formal suits under the deterrent power of Doolin, tied the tie, carrying a briefcase like a successful person. Get off work. But once these people are sure that Du Lin can't take care of it, they will definitely tear off all the disguise and change back to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rules have not yet stood up, they still have a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty days have passed since the assassination, the hymn consortium has sent a few photos for Du Lin, the one in the photo was driven out of the office by himself. The guy was lying on the ground and dying, shooting from multiple angles, and in the letters that came with the photos, the family of the Cape family expressed deep apologies to Du Lin. He told Doolin in the letter that the person who had broken their relationship had received the punishment he deserved, and hoped that Du Lin would let go of the matter and talk about the casino again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cape family and the hymn consortium seem to be in a position to win the game. Originally, Doolin still didn’t understand that a powerful consortium like this did not need a casino to add to them. So why do they fancy this casino so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, Mr. Jack confuses him. The hymn consortium needs casinos to launder money, so they must have a full license to be able to put their own money. After washing, put it in your pocket. Like the empire, there are a lot of money in the hands of these nobility consortia. As for why it is not clean, why is it not clean, Mr. Jack did not say, perhaps this is the industry ethics he has always emphasized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Mr. Jack’s reminder, Du Lin understood that the owner of the Cape family wrote a letter to want a casino. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is impossible. Even the poker team has only 5 percent cross-shareholding. Why can they get an entire casino? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shredded the letter and threw it into the trash, and then took the photo up. These are "criminals." No matter if the guy is really dead, he must "die". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
