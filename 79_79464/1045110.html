			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 9 o'clock in the evening, Du Lin met Sandra, who had to talk, and the two opened a business suite at the Holiday Inn Van Lill, let the hotel waiter Sending some to eat and drink, Du Lin is a little hungry. Du Lin had planned to rest early at night, so he didn't eat much. He listened to Angela saying that eating too much dinner would affect the sleep of one night, so Du Lin only had six minutes to eat at night. There are still things in the evening, and it seems that I may not be able to sleep before ten o'clock. It is better to eat something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, it took some time." At 9:20, Du Lin picked up the napkin and stained the oil on her lips and threw the napkin. After the dining car went out of the restaurant and sat on the sofa in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlier is close to the middle of the empire and borders the south. It is also a city with more tourists. The usual tourist status is high and low, and the types of rooms are also More complete. From the top-level royal suites to the standard standard rooms, you can see them elsewhere, as well as here. In order to better talk about things, Du Lin asked for a business suite. This room has a total of three bedrooms, a restaurant, two living rooms similar to the study and living room, mainly for those business elites. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want a standard room in general..., sitting in the bedroom and talking about things, there is always something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra didn’t smile, but she didn’t have anything at night, the night in the west was really boring, and there were only five left in the red wine on the coffee table. About a quarter of the red wine, her face is more and more rosy. Her fingers licked her hair between her hair and her neck, leaned back and pressed her legs against the sofa. "Nothing, I just need to think about other things."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the woman wait for a gentleman to do, but the gentleman will also have a hungry time.", Du Lin said with a smile, and then began to pick up The topic that came down, "Ms. Sandra, don't know what you have to say tonight? I honestly just got back from the emperor's steam locomotive. If you can, let us say what we are going to say is simple. Some."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra squinted a little and made a movement that was inconsistent with her years. She actually spit her tongue, though only Showing a little bit of tongue, but Doolin thinks she is drinking too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, in fact, it is not a big deal. In the afternoon, Mennon invited Carlos, Clilan and I to the venue of the West Mine. He planned to manage the rest of the West Mine and also to develop around. The land is going to build a high-end commercial center centered on that land." Sandra said that she listened to it. She has been observing Du Lin’s expression, but unfortunately, Du Lin’s face sat down. There has been no change since the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He wants us to invest and offer us a low-interest loan of $1.5 million each, and I refused."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Carlos and Clilan agreed, and they are willing to continue working with the farmers to develop the project."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Du Lin’s face has always been a very serious expression. He nodded. “The idea of ​​Mennon is very good. I have been there in that place. The location is very good, and the whole plot is very large. In Fanli. Before it was built, it was actually a rural area. The people of the West Mines accounted for a lot of cheap. Now it’s cheaper and cheaper. This is a good investment project, Ms. Sandra, why should you refuse? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a good opportunity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice for Carlos and Clilan Du Lin did not pay attention to it. The capitalist always pursued the interest. From the day when the doorman was "forgiven", he knew the country club. Collective certainly be a problem. To put it simply, these people have already spent a lot of money, using a lot of connections and people's cards on the door farmers. They are certainly not supporters of the farmers. They exchanged the way for them in this way. Business support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, the chemical plant in Bondica has almost moved to the west, why? Because other places do not allow them to establish chemical plants, or they need to build more complex and expensive waste treatment plants. It seems that three years ago or four years ago, a chemical plant started to discharge industrial sewage directly into the groundwater system, causing multi-person poisoning in nearby towns, which led to a large-scale demonstration and controversy. The Imperial Environment Agency also began to work. Legislate on the standards of the ecological environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the west, this is not a problem, the farmers have solved all their worries for them, they are said to have a set of "dry throwing" waste disposal The method is to let the chemical fertilizer and sewage evaporate at a high temperature in the pool, and finally leave the solid powder particles, and then pack the powder particles and bury them in the wilderness in the west. If it is not specifically troublesome, it may take decades or even hundreds of years to expose these things when the West is also fully developed. As for the gases that may be poisonous, they are scattered by the wind on the West Coast. As long as there are no dead people... even if they are dead, the doormen can also be crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have already invested a lot of resources in the doormen. Now that the farmers have been lifted, they will naturally not "re-build" and re-invest in Du Lin or the next successor. Their own hearts for the pursuit of interests are not allowed, and the board of directors and chairman of them are not allowed. In addition, the Mennon side is very stable, even Powell has called him personally. What else is not at ease? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing that makes Dolin feel strange is that Sandra didn’t continue to work with the farmers. This is a strange thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra smiled and shook her head. She did not answer Du Lin’s question. Instead, she talked about things that have nothing to do with it. “I have many brothers and sisters! "Sandra pulled the glass and swayed. The red liquid swayed in the glass, and it was circled again and again. The liquid that had just hanged down the wall had not yet fallen to the bottom, and was flooded by the new wave. She took a sip and looked at Du Lin's smile and said, "I am not exaggerating the concept of 'multi'. It is really a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "As far as I know, on the evening of the New Year, there are about 50 brothers and sisters who are eligible to enter the manor restaurant to sit down and dine. There are still many people who are not qualified to sit at the table. Or it is not eligible to return to the manor for the New Year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I was young, I never understood why this is why I have so many brothers and sisters, why are there? So many brothers and sisters stand on the edge of the restaurant wall, envious, jealous, hateful, mocking , sarcasm and even vicious eyes look at us sitting. I think they are very poor, but I don't know how to change this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One year "I am about nine years old?", Sandra put the glass back on the coffee table, picked up the bottle and poured it again. She squinted and recalled for a while. "About 19 to 10 years old, still from the New Year. For three days, my grandfather, the grandfather of most of the children, brought us together, about a hundred children, and he gave us a question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The topic is very simple. If you have ten dollars on the ground, what do you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After that night, many brothers and sisters never have When they have appeared, they have returned to their families and become ordinary people. Like most ordinary people in this society, they need to work hard to get a promotion and raise salary. They need to worry about some small amount of money. Things are asking for people. They are deprived of the power to use family names, not allowed V. Any person something about their origin, they are not even allowed to take the initiative in front of family members "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
