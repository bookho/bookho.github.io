			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men sitting here are not fools, maybe because of the experience and vision they have experienced, they have different views on the further development of the situation. But in reading something that has already been ripe, its core is basically the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just said these words, it has already caused Ernst’s attention, and it is enough to let them know that Du Lin really understands Nair City's rules of the game. The big men who are tall are like lying in the clouds, playing the chess pieces with the city of Tener. They don't want to see an over-integrated group of people with the ability to compete against themselves and even challenge themselves. At the same time, they do not like the fierce competition between them to promote their ultimate evolution, so they have developed a competition system within a controllable range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this system, every person in the city, every force will be installed in this machine called Ternell as a strictly measured spare parts. No, any internal faults will occur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s idea is very simple. In the current situation, eggs can’t break through the control from the top, so why not follow them and make another Path, use another method to get out of a different path? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Doolin's next statement, he believes that within the city of Tener, the three parties can still compete with each other by means of rules. But outside the city of Tener, everyone should unite and plunder wealth in other, more affluent places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private wine is like an alternative materialized currency, anytime, anywhere, as long as you have a bottle of smuggled wine in your hand, completely You can change your money in the vicinity. As long as the moments of the slightly irritating liquid are put into the bottle, there is no need to consider it for sale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people set up a brand new company to specialize in "outside" trade, at this point, whether it is Ensert or Karur, they listen very carefully. I also agree with Du Lin’s idea. Once the private wine in their hands is spread across Cannes, they will gain an unimaginable wealth. Of course, there are some risks when getting anything, which is directly related to how much you get. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the bankers in the field, they are certainly not willing to see new products appearing in their already stable market. This is not a battle between three and five. This is a commercial war of 10,000. Under Doolin’s lobbying, the other two parties are willing to pay a portion of the money and some people as a guarantee to enter other markets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one thing is not to talk about, that is the composition of the stock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Doolin, he wants to occupy at least 51% of the trading company. He does not care about absolute control. This is not What legal sales, whoever occupies more shares, will be unlucky in the future if the general ledger is to be counted one day. He just optimized the current market share, and raised the idea, who made his goods sell the best, the market share is the highest? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a firm opposition to Karur, because in the shareholding plan, Doolin took 51%, Ernst Going 30%, leaving him only 19%, this is why he is unacceptable. I don't have reason to do everything together, I will take the least? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Ernst expressed silence, he believes that he can eat 30% is already earned, and he is now the biggest head of income Not on private wine. As I said before, no one is indifferent to wealth, and Ernst is also. This is a very fast and profitable business. Although it is not his main source of income, it is also an aspect that cannot be ignored, so even if he only has 30% of shares, he has no complaints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that is not satisfied is Karur, but he may not understand it. Sometimes the voice of a voice is not directly related to the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heated discussion gave Du Lin a bit of hunger. After all, he was still a half-sized kid. When he was a long body, a steak might fill It’s the adult belly of Ernst or Karur, but for young people who have a more persistent pursuit of nutrition and satiety, a steak is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give me another one, just the steak." Du Lin looked at the attendant with a slight head and snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second he grabbed the bow tie of the attendant, and pulled down the force of the squatting, the head of the attendant and the plate on the table that had not yet been packed. An intimate contact. A bang, the fine porcelain plates were broken into pieces, some of which stabbed his cheeks and some blood on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like your eyes." Du Lin reached out and held the fork on the table in his hand. "I know what you are thinking," But I don't like your thoughts, and I don't like your eyes. You should hide those things that are not discovered by me, but you didn't do it!" The next moment, the fork of the fork was inserted into the shoulder of the attendant. The attendant closed his mouth and his body trembled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
