			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer’s attitude of eating soft and not eating makes Manin very angry. He can see that this lawyer is not really a person who is not afraid of death. He believes that In the afternoon, the lawyer was able to make clear what he had done in the bed last night, but he also knows the truth, time is not waiting for people. At this time, Mann was a little embarrassed. Fortunately, the team leader of the Imperial Capital had already seen some of the things inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rogue lawyers don’t have any official people who like them. They are monsters that they can never eat enough. Just give them money, they get the money. You can sue your family in a moment, even sue yourself, and send yourself to jail – as long as the money is given to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Mann started to work, everyone didn’t make a sound. It’s certainly the best result to be able to scare this guy. If you can’t scare, there’s another one. Individuals come out to play round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who played the round field was the leader of the investigation team. He knocked on the table with his finger joints, and the finger that Manin had touched the trigger was also received. Come back, "Well, Colonel Mann. I know that you are very urgent, but we are all civilized people, we should use a more civilized way to resolve the current differences." He said that he pulled out a pocket from his chest. Pen, signed the document, and let people send it in the past, "If you wish, I issued this pardon on behalf of the cabinet, as long as you did not kill someone, then other minor charges will be immediately forgiven, and It also provides excellent protection to protect your life before the case is closed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer glanced at the signature on the document and he was satisfied with the official document. In the bag. As a good wandering lawyer, you will definitely have your own circle, and at the same time be the best lawyer in the empire, and their circle will be even smaller. In the top circle of the lawyer industry, there is a very special name, because every circle has his existence, his name is Kevin. The cases that Kevin had previously represented are now going to become typical textbooks for the judicial professions in major universities. One seemingly impossible case has become eclipsed in his hands, which is really eye-opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even many lawyers are also studying Kevin’s case, and this one in the room is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is an admirer of Kevin, who madly admires all of Kevin’s cases and uses Kevin as his goal in the legal profession. So he also joined some circles, and he has a common friendship with Kevin. Kevin gave him a call more than two months ago and needed him to help him do something. He agreed. This has nothing to do with friendship or worship. In place of Kevin, the person who talks with him has a price of one million. After the tax, one million does not need to go through a law firm. All the money will be directly credited to his designated account. He only needs to do a little thing to sell the doorman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Accurately, he was challenged by imperial law and justice. He could not watch a person who harmed the security and interests of the empire and evaded the law with ulterior motives. He is willing to bear the notoriety of selling customers, but also bravely stand up and open the curtain of darkness. What a noble spirit this is, how pure this character is, he simply sang the heroic and tragic song of generosity for this era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, some people are unlucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gentlemen, the people you are looking for have left the West, and have even left the empire. They may have embarked on the federal land now and changed their names. Into the federal society. I know what you want to ask, the person who made all these decisions, Mr. Mennon, Mr. Mennon asked me to make a few calls, said some sentences that I don’t quite understand, and then They sent these four people out." The lawyers cooperated very well with the things that people were interested in, and everyone's expressions became dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I have a little thing here, maybe I can provide some help.", he said that he put a tape on the table, inside There was a conversation between him and the doorman. Of course, after some modifications, even the voice of the doorman was not what the doorman himself said. Yes, this is a perjury that was created because of the need. At this time, the evidence is not forged. It is not so important to have legal benefits. What is important is that everyone has found what they want. That is the whereabouts of the four people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the four most important people left the West and even left the empire, it’s not a thing to arrest them and find everything clear. It's easy. For those who have a high social status and prestige like this, the federation will like them very much and will provide them with corresponding protection measures. These people may not be able to appear in front of the public for a lifetime, but when they need to appear, they will inevitably put the empire in a passive position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if they can't do that, it's good to use them to disgust and disgust the imperial people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Mann frowned, he shook his head and said, "This is impossible. The people we follow them watched them participate in a dance party. At the same time, we have begun to block all the roads that Vanlier has left the city, including those that may or may not exist. They are all stationed. They cannot escape the empire in such a short time, you lie!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer was not worried about Colonel Mann’s doubts. He smiled as always, and even nodded slightly. “Yes, according to Colonel Mann’s general approach, the city is indeed inseparable, but if "When it comes to the lawyers here, the lawyer laughs heartily and keeps eyeing at Colonel Mann. "But if they change their appearance, they are driving military vehicles in the military uniform to leave the city?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of those people in the room suddenly focused on Colonel Mann’s face, and the lethality of this sentence caused Colonel Mann’s head to suddenly have a sweat. They did not inspect and intercept the military vehicles at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the investigation team glanced at Colonel Mann, who could not argue with it, and slowly stood up. "Chanman Colonel, I need you to submit a report to I, about why the Imperial Army equipment is so easy to appear in the hands of people who should not have, the Western Military District is too disappointing, to get things clear as soon as possible, and then tell me the results."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the departure of the investigation team leader, Colonel Manin had a cigarette on the wall, his eyes were as violent as the injured beast, and the female watch had been raised since he left the military area. There was nothing that was going to make people happy, but the bad things lined up to hit his face. He needed to be quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team leader who just stepped out of the door immediately began to arrange work. Since the four people are no longer in the empire, there is no need to continue searching for them. The thing is to arrest the doorman immediately and prevent him from absconding. At the same time, he must get the exact testimony from the mouth of the doorman, let him tell him what he is doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in the deepest part of the investigation team leader, he felt very relaxed. So far, there are still many things in the West that are not clear. For example, who assassinated Doolin, who assassinated the Mennon, who assassinated the executives of the Western Mining Association. At this time, guessing alone is meaningless. No matter who he thinks is made, he must come up with enough evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter whether Du Lin or the door peasant is not comparable to the little lawyer in the room, if you want to move these big people, you must have enough evidence, even if It is false evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the situation is very good now, the four executives of the West Mine have already absconded, and all the unclear things can be pushed to their heads. It was determined that they were made by four of them. If someone thinks it is not, then you can go and ask for it yourself. People have already ran, and they have the ability to chase them back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
