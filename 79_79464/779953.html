			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half a million? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many, how many ordinary families don’t say a lifetime, that is, they have lost less than half a million in three lifetimes. But this money is not much in Luke's eyes. His mining area only needs more than two months to produce all kinds of ore with a total value of about 500,000. Although 500,000 is not much for him, it represents his face. He is not the money, but the decent face that Du Lin has swept. So he brought people to Irian in person, just to get back his own decent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He considered that Irian was not his own little kingdom after all, and he was too aggressive to say that the city hall would interfere, so his idea was very simple, as long as Du Lin was in public. Even if the apology is over, even the 500,000 he has no plans to pass. As for this request, he also considered it. After all, he was the victim of the incident. It was the other party’s direct use of despicable means to attack the crew members, which caused the film to lose its original meaning, so his request. Very reasonable, at least he thinks so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he didn’t think was that this guy named Doolin was running such a big project, and Luke couldn’t help but think of the word trust. stand up. The more powerful movies, the more famous women, the bigger box office income, are never as influential and social status as the identity of a trust partner! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to buy shares, he has never been so determined to do something, now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Luke’s request, Du Lin’s quietly leaning on the sofa, looking up at the beautiful chandelier hanging on the ceiling, looks He was thinking, and it was very unpleasant to think. Luke vaguely saw that his eyelids were twitching. But only Du Lin knew that he was doing this to hold back his laugh, so that his face would not be able to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never heard of someone who ran thousands of miles in order to go bankrupt. If the world’s rich have this determination and perseverance, why can’t build a What philosophers say in the mouth of Utopia? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, he only stunned his face and looked down at Luke. There was a dangerous luster in his eyes. This kind of gaze is familiar to Luke. He has also had it himself. He had also considered that if Doolin refused to buy shares, he would use some means that didn't get a countertop to let Du Lin compromise, but when he saw this look, he knew that things were not as simple as he imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is true that the rich who dare to directly create a car accident to send their "competitors" to hospital, is definitely not a fuel-efficient lamp. He had a headache at this time. If he knew that there was such a good project in Du Lin’s hand, he would not have come to the fair with a strong team like today. He should be sincere. Come through this little misunderstanding and dulin's gang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Luke thought that Du Lin would reject his proposal, Du Lin frowned and said something that made him happy. "I invested in the previous period." There are a lot of money, if you want to mix in, not three or five thousand is enough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this sentence Luke almost happy to pick it up His face suddenly showed an exaggerated smile, and he took the initiative to move his ass to Du Lin. "I have a little understanding of what you are doing. How much do you think is appropriate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a "upstart", Luke has got rid of the initial obsession with money, and even in his underground kingdom, he does not know how much wealth he has. Waiting for the workers to dig, for now, in his concept, money is equal to time. As long as there is sufficient time, there will be sufficient money. What he lacks is not money, it is status! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not answer this question and asked: "Mr. Luke, how much do you think you should pay? I always have an envelope, how much is there? How much to do, it all depends on you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke’s face is a bit serious, he puts his hand on his lap, and his scum smells almost Come. He slowly nodded his head, thinking about how much of his current assets and flowing funds. What Du Lin said is very clear. He will be small when he has less money and he will be bigger when he has more money. This is definitely a golden opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good projects often have, but the problem is that those who own those projects don’t necessarily take you to play, Luke has considered it for a long time, giving a self that is currently acceptable The answer - six million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not his whole, but it is already a big part of liquidity. He has made a lot of money through mining in the past few years, and this money was spent on the infrastructure of the small kingdom in the early days. Later, it was used for his personal squandering. Until now, the liquidity in his hands is actually six or seven million. The fact that he has taken so much at a time means that there will be a lack of funds for a long time in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it doesn't matter. Once Doolin's work is done, it means that he has created a gold mine that he will never dig! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is worth it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not expect Luke to dare to vote so much, knowing that they are not familiar with each other, this is the first time to meet, even There were still some contradictions and conflicts between the two before. In such a situation, Luke dared to come up with so much money, nothing more than two points. First, he is not afraid of swallowing the money to run the road; second, he attaches great importance to status and prestige, and its degree has exceeded the emphasis on money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t understand why Luke’s reputation and status are so important, but he is so generous, it makes Du Lin feel a little troublesome. No matter how much these rich people don’t value the value of money, they will not let others squander their wealth. After so much money comes in, they will definitely arrange a series of personnel relations to stare at the use of this money. I will also stare at the next work of Doolin. If you let him discover that he is actually pretending to be pretending, the problem is serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it’s Du Lin’s turn to meditate, do you want to reject him? At first, he thought that Luke could only come up with one million and two million. He could completely refuse to participate in the company's operations on the grounds of trade secrets. But this money has reached a certain number, he can't open this mouth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was thinking, Luke was a bit nervous, he did not think that he had to contact Duo Lin himself directly with the George family. After all, this is a brand new project, no Is it only allowed to allow these three to enter the market? After he came back, he tried to call Ms. Chris, and Chris also called, but the answer made him speechless. The other party said that if he has this idea, please contact the George family directly... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contact who? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These capitalists are really not good things! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a long time, Du Lin’s face finally showed a smile, he stood up, Luke followed up and stood up, Du Lin reached out and said with a smile. "Why do you want to refuse? This is very beneficial to you for me. Capital is more abundant means that we can do more things and take a more active position in the face of the George family. It is a good thing to win more benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke immediately grinned and held out his hands and dulined tightly, and shook it with force. "This is exactly what I want to say!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The two released their hands, and Du Lin did not do it. He took out a cigarette directly on his mouth. The dogleg butcher behind Luke immediately ran over and gave Duolin a fire. I took a cigarette and the smoke passed through the lungs. Du Lin’s thoughts became clearer. “Since we decided to cooperate, then there was no need for this company. You invested in a new company. The capital injection is filled according to what you said is six million, and I use the assets of the company I own now as funds to be incorporated into your company. According to the ratio of capital injection by both parties, what do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke nodded hard, "I think so too!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" OK, as soon as possible Contact your personal legal counsel and financial advisor. If there are no other objections, we will sign the agreement the next morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke got up and sent Du Lin, while walking As I said, "There is no problem at all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two shook hands outside the villa, the atmosphere was very harmonious, Luke even asked to ask Du Lin to find a A wonderful place to relax, but Du Lin has other things. After watching Du Lin’s car leave, Luke slammed his fist and his face showed an excited smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows about it, or listen to his friend. In the morning, he swept the woman named Freina and left the scene of the food festival. When he came back, the gas had almost disappeared. Although he is sometimes impulsive and very rash, it does not mean that he has no brain. Originally he was a party to the rationale, but because he did a temper to do something that he thought was not a great move, the result made him a little unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finding a friend and having a more detailed understanding of Doolin, he found that he almost missed one of the biggest opportunities in life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a movie? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a female celebrity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, give it to him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
