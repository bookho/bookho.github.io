			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin had the mood to talk to the reporters for the first time. He did not say how he changed the industry. But this does not prevent reporters from starting their own smart dog brain to guess from what Du Lin just said. Looking at Du Lin's back disappeared into the door of the court, these reporters began to check the transcripts of the interviews in the group, and also exchanged what he meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the very unique reporter, surrounded by more people, he did not appear to be inferior because of his different looks, the reporter’s line There is no character with inferiority. He leaned his head slightly, as if he was asking God to let himself come to the world. Why wasn't the first kiss of the mother, but the kiss of the earth? His voice was very loud, and he said his own guess. "Mr. Du Lin said that people who can't move the camera in the future can't be a reporter. Maybe we can continue to guess from here, how to use the camera and how to use it. A good-looking company?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't need someone to answer him, he just said his thoughts directly, "Must be through the intuitive way, but I I feel that there is another problem. The high price and production cycle of the tape can't meet the real-time demand of the news hotspots. Is there a roll of tape every day? I am afraid that only one percent of the entire empire can afford it!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven-neck tape is issued one volume a day, and it is more than two hundred dollars a month. Can it be seen by only a small group of people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as these people are still guessing what Du Lin is suggesting, another car is parked under the steps, and the reporters are squeezing past .... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven't told me what to do." Sitting in the lounge, Freina whispered. In fact, they tried to invent a piston structure without a curved rod last night. The results of the final test prove that such a structure does not guarantee a long time of work. Once the work reaches a certain threshold, the work efficiency will be reduced. And there is a phenomenon that the piston power is missing and the plug is locked. Neither Du Lin nor Freena did mention this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With two minutes left, Du Lin explained it casually. "I got some patents that allowed every household to receive different content every day, and The tape is displayed directly in the form of a picture, so your work will be heavy in the beginning, and we will say it after the trial."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freina cleverly closed her mouth, but only the information revealed by Du Lin has already excited her to some slight tremors. She spent more than half a year at the Star of the Empire, and it is natural to know how amazing the TV is to present the picture and sound directly to the audience. If she can see different things every day, she can't imagine how this company will change the world. As the first executive director, she will become a topical figure and what kind of position she has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a minute or so after leaving the court, the agent of the Cape family appeared in the courtroom and he went straight to the judge’s lounge. Then came out again. He submitted a power of attorney, and Polly is now unable to come in person, so he authorized the lawyer to represent him and all the decisions of the Cape family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poly is currently fighting with his brother for the position of the owner. The old Cape died too suddenly, leaving no will, so two In order to compete for the position of the homeowner, the heirs have surfaced the contradictions and heated up. In addition to not using the means of assassination, it has already been in the family, which is one of the fuses of the division of the hymn consortium. Another reason is the death of the old cape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the most important part of the hymn consortium, the death of Old Cape and the current situation of the hymn consortium have already made many people have ideas. In addition, the Cape family has opened the infighting mode, and any mature capital will not allow such a situation to continue to cooperate with the Cape family. Recently, other members of the hymn consortium have begun to contact privately, and they intend to kick out Cape to the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I don’t know which one lacks loyalty to expose this thing. In short, it’s a mess now, and Polly has no intention to continue to argue with Du Lin. Who is wrong, he directly asked the lawyer to plead guilty, no matter whether Du Lin has any backhands, he must admit his crimes and solve the matter as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Justice just let everyone sit down, and Polly’s attorney stood up and said that Mr. Polly gave up his defense and was willing to plead guilty. This time, the plaintiff’s attorney did not jump out and shouted against it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing is the matter of Magus, and he has not much relationship with him. As for what the Cape family will end up with, Du Lin thinks that with the help of Magus's wrists and decisiveness, these people are afraid to be completely erased from the circle of imperial aristocracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that makes people "distressed" is Donald, who seems to be the "only" victim. The defense lawyer of the defendant presented two death certificates to the judge after the judge announced the results of the trial, proving that Soro and his grandson had died and could not continue to execute the punishment imposed on them by the court. As a result, the case is over now. It is very loud at first, and the result is a bit hasty. It is really unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is mainly to blame the old and old Cappe died too early, this unlucky guy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, Du Lin had a meal with Freina, and after she had some ideas and plans about the new company, she was asked to go back. In the afternoon, he would To see Magus, this occasion is not suitable for taking other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two hours of rest, Doolin walked outside the villa of Magus, and when he entered the study room of Magus, he was surprised. I saw two people who should not have appeared here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is Donald, and there is something similar to his appearance, but older, it should be Donald's father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the subsequent introduction of Magus, Verin’s speculation was verified. This older one is Donald’s father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a little accident?", Magus asked with a smile, and he stood up and walked over to the sofa where Du Lin was sitting. Go on. The old guy looks more slim than the last time Du Lin saw him, but his head is very good, his eyes are as warm as ever. "In fact, I have never told you that Donald is his own." He said this sentence. I have been observing Du Lin’s expression. Du Lin’s face has not changed significantly. “I wanted to tell you earlier, but this may affect our next plan, but I didn’t think that old thing is so Fortunately, the first step back to the embrace of God, so this plan can only be said to be halfway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded quietly, said in his heart Surprised, it may not be surprising. In fact, he can feel the sudden change of Donald's style before and after. He also thought that this guy might have been too embarrassed by himself and rebounded immediately after he left. But he soon realized the mistake of this idea, because Donald is a nobleman, he also has a father of a new party. If he dares to sell the interests of the new party in a big way, not only will he be unlucky, but his father will also be unlucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he did not replace his father as the lonely owner of the fallen aristocracy, he must obey the will of the current homeowner. This is a serious fact that cannot be changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he feels that there may be other changes in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus watched Dulliner silently, he had to explain it, he explained that the inside story was not explained for Du Lin, he believed Du Lin Can understand some of these changes. The purpose of his explanation of the origin of the matter was actually to follow the father and son of Donald, let them see that they had already told Du Lin about the cause of the matter, so that they did not need to worry anymore, and Du Lin also cooperated very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Dulin was dismissed from the mayor of Otis in an accident, the focus of the Cape family was placed in conjunction with the Fatima family to develop the Southern Special Zone. There is no thought at all to continue to attack the city of Otis. In such a situation, there are only two options for the Kape family to operate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to find a force point from the southern SAR to pull the Cape family into the water. However, the danger and unpredictability of this approach is too great. The absolute dominance of the Fatima family in the northern aristocracy circle is not a joke. Once the sacred woman is unable to hold his own temper, he will fight. The consequences are too serious. So Magus chose to give up on this idea and chose the second method, which is to pull the Cape family back into their trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to do this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This requires a "little friend", a child with a brick in hand and swaying through the city, Donald is very suitable. With the help of Marquez, Donald tried to win over Polly and completed the account of Magus. Of course, there were some sharp contradictions with Du Lin. Now that the matter is over, Magus must resolve this contradiction, and it is in the face of Donald and his father, otherwise it will inevitably lead some people to have some strange thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Magus explained, Du Lin had a smile on his face, as if he really knew why these unpleasant things happened, he even took the initiative. I walked up to the front of Donald and the father, and extended a hand representing friendship, and shook hands with the two. "I have never been concerned about those things in the past, and will not be in the future. We are all working hard for the same goal." People should trust and help each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
