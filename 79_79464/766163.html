			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin met the old Fowlers at the last banquet, but did not say anything. Old Forrests was the first real estate developer in Irian, who hoarded a lot of land when the land was extremely cheap. After Irian developed, he built a lot of shopping malls and houses on those plots and ate it in one go. Become a fat man. This kind of person is not investing, but is speculating. They are betting that Irian can develop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every speculator can get rich overnight, most speculators may end up with nothing, but dozens of times, dozens of times of profits are still attracting many Speculators are desperate to invest all their assets in a certain area, in a certain field. This kind of person is not a minority, for example, the couple of farms in the neighboring state, are they not speculators? Only their speculation failed, and they bought a lot of cheap land but did not wait for the rapid development of the city. As a result, they turned themselves into rich farmers, merchants, and students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For them they are lucky because they are not bankrupt, at least the land is still their own. Maybe one day the city will gradually catch up with other regions, and the farms in their hands will become a huge gold mine, but no one knows when the day will come back, they may not wait, and their children may wait. If not, let their grandchildren and descendants sigh the ancestors' "smart" decision-making and "long-term" gaze! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More information about Fowlers and his son will soon be available. Irian’s intelligence network Bit Nair’s intelligence network is fast and fast, Du Lin carefully Looking at the intelligence in his hand, he has not let go for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Forrests is indeed a far-sighted speculator who bought a large piece of land when Irian had not made a fortune. His idea is that Ilyan, one of the three deep-water ports of the empire, will have a huge change, so he sold all the assets he could sell, carrying a box of money from the bustling city to the poor and backward Irian. I bought all the land I could buy in Irian. He built a house here, and his wife became the same farmer as the old couple in the next city, and then waited for great development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mortgaged some of these skins to the bank, borrowed money from the bank, and built nearly one-third of the buildings in the first district. Things. Relying on this huge income, he quickly filled his land with shopping malls, houses and other facilities. After becoming a rich man, Old Forrests seems to have no courage and ambition to continue to expand and continue to speculate. He is willing to live a luxurious life here, indulging in daily social and entertainment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His son naturally learned the attitude of Old Forrest on life, only pursued enjoyment, never considered what he should do. Already eighteen years old, in addition to being fooled around with women everywhere, is to get drunk with a group of wine friends. For his son’s negative attitude towards life, Old Fuller is not very concerned. He laughed more than once and said that his money is enough for him and his son, his grandson and more descendants to live a profligate life. There is no need to Let your children go for life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Little Forrest being the only child of Old Forrest, he must have spoiled him, no matter what he wants or does, he has an old Flews cleaned up the mess for him. Some people used to take the opportunity to extort the old Fuller, some succeeded, and some failed. Although Old Forrests did not have further ambitions, his wealth is destined to make him a famous figure in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a very broad network of contacts and wealth, there are very few things that he is not doing. For him, everything is actually one thing, nothing more than spending money. Only! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a very interesting piece of information. In order to be angry with people, Little Forrests has self-directed a farce and kidnapped himself and succeeded. I swindled 100,000 pieces from Old Forrest. Later, Old Fuller knew about it and didn't say much. He even thought that Little Fleurs was really smart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellent life makes his former lion lose sharp claws, sharp teeth, his life, his life and everything he has Full of decaying taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Fules, who holds a large amount of real estate and real estate, can extract an amazing rental fee every month. He is the real "rich family" "! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether or not he could withdraw a little money from his pocket through this matter, Du Lin considered it, but finally gave up. What he wants in this matter is "name", not "profit." Only the Guarts learned about the existence of him and his fellow countrymen, and recognized him as the president. The following things will develop. If you want money, Juan will give him a lot of money, and there are others who will give him a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is actually another important factor, that is, the money is not so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Fowlers has only one sister, but has not been contacted for a long time, since he sold all his family to Ilyan as a farmer, there is no I have contacted and I have lost contact. There seems to be no one in his wife who still keeps in touch. No one has visited their husband and wife during these years. The only ones who have a relationship with them are their sons. Old Fowlers will definitely break out when their son dies, no matter what the final result, his property and his money can only be cheaper to the City Hall and the Imperial Bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is too difficult to insert a hand, and time is not allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to arrange this to make sure you can't leave any flaws, but let Old Forrest know." Du Lin put these information files A hand was given to the Buddha. He had no time to do this recently, and this little thing can be done very well. He is now going to execute the second step of the plan to see the girl, Nasha George. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doolin drove outside the hotel, the hotel’s concierge took the key from him and parked him in the garage. In the middle, then handed the key to the front desk. People may not know who Du Lin was before, but since that dinner, many people already know who Du Lin is, so don't worry that those people will mistake the keys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the elevator, Doolin passed the plan in his mind again. I came to see Nasa today... Accurately, I came to see Nasha’s secretary. The main purpose is to convince her that in the southern part of the empire, Doolin and Juan have taken the lead in starting the process of cutting out the Hu and expressing their ideas. Work with the George family. He does not need a small secretary to respond directly to his request, as long as the small secretary does not deny this matter is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the wealthy George family needs to be as cautious and careful as possible in the face of an industry layout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elevator opened with a slight vibration and immediately two men greeted. They wore very well-dressed suits, and one of them also showed a holster hanging on the strap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, this is currently a private territory. If you do not have an appointment, please leave now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the face of two door-like bodyguards, Doolin is not angry with anything. People can only praise and do their best, and he does not have to make mistakes. "I have reserved an appointment with Ms. Chris." I am Du Lin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if Du Lin’s name is particularly useful, or that appointment has worked, and two bodyguards have opened the aisle. One of them entered the suite at the end of the corridor in the first step of Doolin, and soon he came out again and invited Du Lin to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suite belongs to Chris, which is the little secretary. When Du Lin entered the room, she saw what Chris was recording on her desk. She didn't lift her head and pointed to the chair next to it. "I'm sorry, I still have a little more to review. You should sit for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
