			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intellect discussion, don't fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t think there is any problem with Mark’s death. There are 4 presidents who died in assassination in American history, and another 5 people almost died. Assassin's hands. Most of these assassins were guns by one person, wearing windbreakers and hats, and then pui in the crowd ended the president of a hegemonic empire. Then I want to ask a question here, how can a really powerful person die so simply? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political groups and mafia behind the killers don’t deal with them, why the consortiums that instigated the assassination don’t deal with them, the president should be shot and not dead for two days to stand up and These people have been fighting for three hundred rounds. How can they die so simply? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this, another question was raised. Mark did not bring a bodyguard. Why didn’t he have a bodyguard? This question is very troublesome to explain. If a reader has participated in a slightly higher level, the salon should understand that no one will bring a bodyguard like a bodyguard to go to that place. If I want to explain this matter clearly, let everyone know at a glance that even the brain does not need to tremble, it may take tens of thousands of words to describe, so stop by, stop saying more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violence is not the best way, but it is the most effective way in the other side of the ocean, because these presidents are not willing to compromise and bow, so they are finished. There may be a brief peace of mind confrontation, such as negotiations, negotiations, threats and the like. But after these ineffectiveness, those people chose the simplest means - to destroy the spirit from the physical level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a bodyguard, bodyguards are not fools can solve things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that a dead person will never bargain with you, won't make you angry, and you will only pay for one bullet, or a few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked myself not to say how good I was, but I can say that I am as close as possible to the style of that era, the attitude and means of certain forces in dealing with opponents. The aspect is horrifying and more exaggerated than what is described in my book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe some of the book's understanding of a particular era comes from some film and television works, such as the movies you said I have not seen. The purpose of film and television production is to show the money, so there are many things that will not be shown for everyone to watch, unless they do not want to release, do not want to make money, or even do not want to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
