			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the premeditated plan of the mastermind of this scam, Amp can’t help but admit that this guy is a rare "genius crime". It’s not that this person has thrown out the foolish move of Hodock’s death to stop the case. In many cases in the past, Amp has seen similar cases. For example, he once supervised a case of perverted murder. Every time when he was about to get close to the truth, there was always a guy who ran out of the head. These surrenderers were able to recap the process of committing crimes in detail, and they were even worse. Let Amp find some small details that he didn't find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is these people criminals? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously not, they are actually part of the victim, and then because of a particular psychological change, they have a cult of the perpetrator, crazy admiration The victim is willing to plead guilty for the perpetrator. Finally, Amp caught the guy, a pastor. The case was suppressed by the church, and the false identity of volunteers was used to inform the criminals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually not a clever trick, but some less savvy tricks can be an extremely important killer after using the right place! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of Hoodock is completely impossible to exert any influence on the investigation team from the perspective of obstructing the investigation, but he is there, the reason for that is not What he wants to do, how to block the direction of misinformation, but what the joint investigation team and the police investigation bureau and the city hall of the capital are doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of this financial fraud case is too bad. Over the past five days, more than 20 people have chosen to jump off the building to end their tragedy. The explosive emergence of such intensive suicides in such a short period of time all pointed to the DreamWorks financial fraud case, which had a terrible impact on society and the economy of the entire empire had declined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be said that the entire emperor and the small half of the empire are paying attention to this matter, and many people are under heavy pressure. If the case cannot be detected in the short term, even if there is a possibility of a short-term stagnation in the process, what will the officials responsible for this matter do in the face of such heavy and increasing pressure? The only idea they had at that time was to find a way that everyone could recognize and end the case as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hoodock is the best choice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this financial fraud case, the imperial administration did not suffer any economic losses, and the central bank of the largest economy of the empire did not suffer any substantial losses. The real losers are the investors on Xie Lisi Street and those investors and speculators. This is different from some cases where the government was deceived or the bank was defrauded. There is no strong promoter in this case. When the above-mentioned pressure is considered to be the end of the case, it will definitely End. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be follow-ups to continue, maybe it’s really here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Amp would think that the mastermind of this case must be very clever, and the analysis of the human heart is in place, and Hodork is the one he threw to those who can decide this. The fig leaf of the big men who made the final result of the case. Once the investigation is deadlocked, the role of Khodork can be reflected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time Amp has dealt with a smart criminal. He used to be handed over with many smart criminals. It turns out that he won, except for gold. Big robbery. But that was not the result of his investigation, but he was not a supervisor, but a consultant. If he is given enough time and manpower, he may not be able to catch the initiator of the Golden Robbery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pinched his nose and walked back to his "temporary office", looking at the clues and directions on the wall, and finally the next stage The main direction was placed on the six million that suddenly disappeared and disappeared. Perhaps the six million would bring him a new "face". There are not many "cards" in his hands. In this game, he still can't see the hope of victory. Only when there are enough cards, he can defeat his opponent in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bangbangbang’s knock on the door alerted the Amp who was thinking. He looked up and was a detective from the police investigation bureau. He Holding a document in his hand, Yang Yang, "The team leader, we just received an anonymous letter. After reading the team leader, Clarke thought that this might be a great help for solving the case. Let me send it to you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp said a thank you, took the document from the detective's hand and pulled out a slightly dusty letter. He rubbed some dust on his fingers and used it as a special powder for fingerprint collection. It is very delicate and has certain chemical properties. When these powders can be adsorbed on the residual substances without damaging the sweat and part of the fat remaining on the surface of the object, they can be completely shaped by spraying with a chemical. Some of the starch components, the fingerprint will be black after the stereotype, according to the process of special shooting, and then gently pressed with a transparent glass with semi-dry glue, take the complete fingerprint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This method has been passed from the federal government and has been used in large cities. The accuracy of fingerprints obtained is very high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his gaze to this anonymous letter again, like many anonymous letters he had contacted, the letter was plain, and the content was also in the newspaper that was cut. Printed pieces are pieced together. The content of this anonymous letter is not much, only two lines of words, one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that the DreamWorks stock fraud was operated by a man named Joshua, whose office is on the back of Xie Lisi Street. On the street, the name of the hirer is Nicole"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp went to the conference room immediately after the meeting and called the man, he sent the anonymous letter to Every detective watched carefully and finally returned to his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about fingerprint collection?" He looked at the agent who just sent him a letter. The agent shook his head and Amp was not disappointed. I also realized that this letter was most likely to be sent by the participants of the fraud case, even the mastermind. In many of the cases he cracked, the murderer and planner always had an inexplicable desire to challenge the police and get a more exciting thrill than committing the crime. He once captured a murderer. Before the capture of him, the murderer even went to the police station personally, and provided some important clues to Amp to the opposite side of the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that some of you want to find out the source of these pieces of paper, but it makes no sense. The Imperial City has a population of more than 18 million people. More than three million newspapers will be sold every day, even if you find the newspapers from which the papers come from. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will talk about my personal First, in this letter, the word 'I' has a larger font than other fonts. The person who writes this anonymous letter should be relatively strong, self-conscious, and attaches great importance to people's views on him. ...", Amp suddenly closed his mouth, a sitting detective raised his hand, and he raised his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Ampu, why is this person a very strong and self-contained person?", the agent raised a question, and other agents also They erect their ears and they are equally curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp did not yell at him, but patiently explained, "This 'I' used a larger font, which shows that he is emphasizing himself and His point of view is that such people are often very self-sufficient and conceited. People with this personality have certain paranoid obstacles. Anything he does will be considered correct, so he will be very embold and will perform. He used the phrase 'speaking' to represent a phrase of uncertainty, but there is detailed information later. This is a very euphemistic expression. He sees himself as standing taller than us. The position may be social class, or something else..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
