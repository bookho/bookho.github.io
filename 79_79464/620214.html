			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said his request after organizing the language. Mr. Kemer did not immediately agree to it, but instead looked at Du Lin curiously, just like It was the first time I saw Doolin, a "stranger." About half a minute, Mr. Kesma asked curiously: "Have you been studying recently? How do you know this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Linwei For a moment, he did not think that Mr. Kemer’s thinking jumped so strangely that he could not say that he could say that he had violated the requirements of imperial law. Instead, he asked him if he had studied. He soon returned to God and nodded. "Yes father, I will read books when I have time. In the city, I learned to read and write, and I also met a lawyer who was bad to the bottom of the foot. After he left Tyne to go to the capital, he threw down some unwanted things and handed it to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin did not carry those when he left A worthless professional book, for a lawyer he has signed in one of the largest law firms in the empire, he will solve any reasonable need for his lawyer, let alone provide him with a complete set of hardcover legal books. - In fact, many times these beautiful and heavy legal books are not for the lawyers of the law firm, but for those who come to consult and seek to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These books are like the indispensable decorations of the law firm. The more luxurious and beautiful, the more symbolic the inexplicable strength. So Kevin left these things, leaving with some pretty good clothes and some memorable things. Before he left, he gave Dulin the things he didn't need, and he had to read these books once he had time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Kevin’s original words, to succeed in this society, you first need to do “reasonable breaking”, followed by “reasonable avoidance”. "Only by doing these two things, will there be a chance that the ladder leading to the heavens will not fall out of the cloud because of an unremarkable pebbles that are out of balance." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin’s words Durin listened very seriously and kept it in mind, because he felt the omnipresent theocracy and empire through his relationship with Kevin. The shackles of law constitute restrictions on everyone, but at the same time some people can easily open these shackles and do some illegal things in a reasonable way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is great, isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding the sacred code in one hand and holding the weapon in the other hand... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So during this time, Du Lin will look at some as long as he has time, and this time his thoughts are also derived from the special According to the records in the Decree, and then according to Kevin's words, a reasonable loophole is drilled. He even sent a telegram to Kevin, who was already in the capital, and Kevin replied with only two words - "No problem." In fact, this is not the author's primary school mathematics did not learn well, nor did it drink too much eyes. In the writing format of Yaoxing Empire, there is no problem. The word has only two syllables. Of course, it can be interpreted as "can". This is two. Words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Du Lin nodded and admitted that there was a reading during this time, Mr. Ke Ma’s mouth slightly touched a slight arc and quickly converges back. He squinted his head slightly, and the palm of one hand pressed on the table, his fingers gently and rhythmically lit the table, making a squeaking sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, he nodded solemnly. "The old drunk is actually good with me, and the Guars in the town are not." Less, presumably such a hard 'work' is only available to us Guart." Mr. Kesma is very talkative, and his speech speed is getting faster. "And I don't think this money is needed. Take it out at once, let the boys act as volunteers, and then subsidize you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin really didn’t expect to be born from Mason this time. After that, Mr. Kesma, who had not left the town, actually had such an idea, which really made him somewhat unprepared. Perhaps it was the horror and incredulity in Du Lin’s eyes. Mr. Kemma’s stereotyped face finally had a smug smile. He picked up his eyebrows and pressed one hand on the 50-dollar bill. It’s up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vigorous and powerful hands are covered with wrinkles and calluses, but at this time the hands seem to have a magic that cannot be said. He put 5,000 pieces of such understatement into his pocket, walked to Doolin's side and patted him on the shoulder. "You bastard, still tender!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin can only nod and say that he is confused by the brain. In fact, Mr. Kemma said that he is going to say something, but Mr. Zema is the first to take the lead. He can't use his own money to be a town, to train seven elite military guards with good military abilities for the empire. He will send some people who are worth sending in as "committed players", that is, you will take care of you. "Responsible players" who drink but do not have a salary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
