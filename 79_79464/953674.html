			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the boys scatter, if they come again, kill them. This is the easiest way." Mr. Xmas does not have any for Anna. Fear, he can kill Anna once, then she will be able to kill her for the second time. From Walter's mouth, he has already guessed the fact that Anna may not have died at the time, and their God has favored her and given her a second life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she also ruined half of her face, so she needed to wear a mask. The only thing that makes Mr. Xerma strange is how Anna found it here. Did someone sell him and tell his message to Anna? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he doesn’t think so much, because if someone really sells him, it’s not Anna and a few soldiers, maybe a Army Division. The horror shadows that the bloody dawn caused in the aristocratic class were not completely dissipated until now. Those who couldn’t be jealous for countless nights thought about killing him. Some of them have become senior officials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna may only have a guess, but it is not very sure, so first explore the intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a look at Walter, an old thing that was filthy and smelly with a smell of alcohol. It’s totally different from the young man who was in the mood. Not coming out. As for the others, the scattered ones are scattered, and only some old folks have stayed and lived in the town. Now their appearance is completely different from the past, and many of them wear masks to protect their identity when they are not acting, for example, he himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma will never admit that the real purpose of wearing a mask at any time and place is to be cool, he just wants to protect himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this does not completely mean that Anna really does not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason walked over with a bottle of high-alcohol. Since Doolin started his private business, Mr. Xerma’s home is never lacking anytime, anywhere. A liquid that can be exchanged for money or enjoyment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the bottle and waved at Mason, and Mason was obediently obedient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has stipulated that the police chief will not be afraid of his old lady! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dulin's bastard is not there, so I will give it to you to do this, understand?", Mr. Kesma looked forward to Mason. He still has great expectations for his eldest son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason scratched his head, "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first day of the New Year, Doolin Was awakened by the phone ringing, he opened his eyes and looked at the beautiful crystal chandelier, slowly sat up. I patted my cheek and reached for the receiver from the bed. "It's me, say!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three short words are mixed with a very Strong momentum, sometimes many people feel that the momentum is a shit, but the momentum does exist. In particular, these superiors, they have the power, status, and wealth that allow them to ignore the rules of the world, even enough to allow them to openly trample on law and fairness, so when they speak, the kind is completely bursting. Self-confidence will become a kind of momentum that makes people bow their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there is also a kind of person who is not affected by this momentum at all, because they are the top of the real food chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you are very famous now, even the governor often goes to you, is it, Mayor Doolin?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;;;;;;;;;; of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the Kadima Party was once his father’s most despised follow-up. The best lawyer is actually a villain. The party leader of the New Party is actually a big aristocrat, even ready to become A capitalist, he also became a very great politician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t forget his father, a violent old man who can make the nobles sleep, thinking that killing the nobles can change the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also love the face of the horse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Listening to me, I have a lot of things lately, so I didn’t go back yesterday. At the end of this year, I promised that I would spend that day at home, and... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin’s words were not finished, they were interrupted by Mr. Kemma. “You don’t have to explain, I know that you are a jerk, so it’s most meaningful for the bastard not to come back and spend a year with the family. The day is a very normal thing." This sentence is very lethal, and directly makes Du Lin speechless. "Say something else, I heard that you know a lot of big people now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin had a bad feeling after listening, so he did not answer so sure, "Ah? Oh! It’s a little bit of understanding."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, I know that you are a big man, think of a way to help me ask the Imperial Intelligence Agency, is there a woman named Anna, you know, that woman is Walter in the past Wife, then she..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After thirty minutes, Du Lin hung up and looked up at the chandelier, and suddenly he felt like he got up to pick up this The phone is one of the most wrong moves. But he has already received it, and the content really makes him feel shocked. I didn’t expect the old man to be so crazy when he was young! This is not a decent thing, it is a thing that makes people feel excited and glorious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched his chin, it was not so easy to find out about this. At that time, Anna was able to be arranged by the empire to do such a top secret task, showing that she must have a deep Background, even if she is not, she can go through such a task and live to this day, her status is absolutely extraordinary. After all, according to Mr. Kesma, after the ambush, the bloody dawn lost too many members, and Mr. Kesma’s self-blame and low mood did not continue for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a Civil War broke out during this time, and the New Party appeared. In a sense, the ambush did not live the bloody dawn organization. The main backbone members have not captured or killed the soul of the bloody dawn, but the achievements are not at all. They indirectly let the bloody dawn exit the stage of history, although there are still some hand and tail, but it has not affected the merits of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe this Ms. Anna is now a member of the Imperial Intelligence Department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to know the details, you have to fall on Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus had called him yesterday, giving him time to go to the emperor’s capital in the first three days of the New Year. He had something to say to Du Lin. By the way, talk about it. Du Lin’s news of packaging the market in Otis was alarmed by the Prime Minister’s Prime Minister. When the Prime Minister knew this, he spent a long time talking about it, and then quickly fell into deep thought. Du Lin’s thoughts and actions are sometimes noisy, and there is something to ponder behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that Magus thought of was not the problem of making money. Instead, he used the method of city listing to pass on the risks and “pain” that need to be faced in the development of the city to the capitalists, while using the wealth and connections of the capitalists to quickly make the empire. Building a city and contributing to the recovery of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very feasible method, and it is also very binding on the capitalists. Once the capital forces excavate the potential of a city, first Unlucky ones will definitely not be ordinary people, and secondly will not be the city hall. The only thing that can be unlucky is their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term bankruptcy is often used in business, so can it be used in the city's finances? Once a city goes bankrupt, stocks are delisted, and the capitalist’s investment is equal to the loss of blood. Even if the knife is slaughtered, even those big consortiums may have to suffer from pain for many years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is really a young man with an idea, energetic, aggressive, persevering, and courageous. The only downside is his origin. If Doolin is a nobleman, Magus will now take Du Lin to his side and sincerely train him to the Prime Minister. Unfortunately, he is only the son of a farmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus can’t wait to see Du Lin, Du Lin originally planned to pass on the 3rd of January, and there will be many people coming to visit the first two days of the New Year. He has a lot of entertainment, but this matter is related to the safety of Mr. Zema. He has to change his itinerary and go to the Imperial Capital in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked Dove to inform the guests who had made an appointment to visit, while staring at the union branch and the Chamber of Commerce, the first few days of the year. It is the time when these organizations like to make trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked in the morning and arrived at the Imperial Capital in the morning. He contacted Magus in advance and went straight to his villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw Magus in the study, Du Lin said with a smile: "When I came, I heard people say that we have spies on the federal side." Was it caught?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus was also stunned by this opening statement. "I am not very clear, who did you listen to?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it?", Doolin sat on his chair across the Maggs table, "The two federals said, I really wanted to They have a meal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
