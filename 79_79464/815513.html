			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the house across the road from the hospital, Mr. Kesma seems to sit very calmly behind the table and smoke, and you can see that his body is being observed. Slightly jittery, occasionally able to hear the sound of wearing a heel from the table. When he knew that Alisa was taken to the hospital by ambulance, the whole person was anxious. He didn't feel so anxious when he gave birth to a child. But I don't know why when he felt that Alisa was going to be born, the third generation of Mr. Ma Ma was born, and the whole heart was raised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cigarettes were pumped one by one, the room was full of smoke, and Mr. Kemer never felt that life was so "heavy". The aristocrats who died in his hands did not say that there were one hundred or seventy or eighty. No matter men and women, young and old, he was like a precise and strict killing machine, constantly taking away the life of the nobility. In his cognition, life is not so heavy, he never fears life, he only takes life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, he breeds something that he did not notice when his wife produced it, surprise, shock, embarrassment, anxiety, as if these negative emotions The money is concentrated. Among the many negative emotions, there are also two positive emotions. He couldn't help but stand up again and walked to the window and looked at the hospital across the road across the glass. He knows how many wards Alisa is in, but it is invisible at this angle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he seems to be able to see, seeing a little green is growing vigorously. He lifted his wrist and glanced at the watch. It was only eight o'clock in the evening. At this time, people were still not in a deep sleep. He needs to wait at least six hours before he can see his grandson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sneaked a sneak peek, the next time he saw Du Lin, he must interrupt Du Lin’s leg. This mixed ball actually made himself so rude, he snorted and made the people in the room a little bit inexplicable. The great and proud Mr. Xerma disdain to explain his behavior, turned and went back to the table and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the room are changing clothes, night clothes, they are wearing several layers of underwear, then put on a gray coat, tightly wrapped around the body, no There is more than a piece of cloth. They also prepared a gray headgear and an exaggerated mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, they plan to rob the hospital at two o'clock in the middle of the night and take away the children belonging to Doolin. This child can only belong to the Kemas family, any No one can take him away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed by, and when the midnight bell struck, Mr. Xema also put on his clothes. He didn't trust this group of hairy feet to touch his noble grandson, this group of bastards, don't even think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Mr. Xema is also secretly guarding, and the group of guys who may have the same intentions may also appear today. Last time they found someone monitoring Alisa and then finding these people out, but unfortunately their mouths were very hard. One of them chose to jump off the building when they were helpless. The other two guys were also interrogated. For a while, I chose suicide when I couldn’t help myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives Mr. Xmas a vague familiarity. He is not sure who the other person is, but since the other chooses to monitor Alisa, then The other party's plan may be the same as him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is very relieved outside, he has a way to know the recent situation of Doolin, he thinks this may be arranged by the enemy of Doolin, the purpose is to pass Alisa and the child, to control Doolin. How can Mr. Xmasma allow such a situation to happen? His pride, his pride and his pride do not allow anyone to hurt his grandson, no matter what he does. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-barrel pistol, which is different from the ordinary pistol, was inserted in the gun bag behind him. The ivory and sterling silver were used as a decorative gun. The classical luxury of the stock, a cigarette on his mouth, took a deep breath, "Let the children guard the passage, the car is ready, we will return to the town overnight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The old man nodded and patted his eldest son as a small bucket. "Do you really understand the words of the old man? Go and do it!", he said that he also licked his son's calf, but he The force is like itching. The eldest son has a three-eyed squat on his back and jumped out from the window on the fourth floor. He hugged the branches of the big tree outside the window and quickly climbed up the trunk to the highest. At the place, hidden in the canopy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other boys have also left the final matter of preparation. Mr. Kemer has thrown his cigarette butt on the ground, lifted his foot and grinded it, and took out a cigarette. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time passed by, the fewer pedestrians on the road, the whole city was quiet. At that time, when the needle pointed to two points, Mr. Kemer changed a quilt and walked toward the door of the hospital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard has fallen asleep. Orodor is the capital of Cannes. Under the bold reform of the new governor, the law and order here is much better than expected, and no one will come to the hospital to make trouble. That is true. I don't want to be good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the hospitals are private, and the patients are not the patient and the family members have the final say. It is the hospital that has the final say. Come to the hospital to make trouble? Believe it or not, it is blacklisted and the entire hospital in Orodo will not receive it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma strode toward the main entrance of the hospital, and at the moment when his one foot entered the light, an exaggerated mask had been taken by him. Fixed to the face. Two guys with the same exaggerated mask followed him, the entire hospital was quiet, only three footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the information obtained by Mr. Xerma, he found the ward on the fourth floor and pushed the door open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a doctor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weak female voice makes Mr. Xerma’s pace a little Don, he went straight in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze was suddenly attracted to the baby in the cradle, completely disregarding the bed, which is reasonably the shock of his daughter-in-law, he gently The cradle lifted up and watched Alisa, who had just returned, shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you... let go of my child, I want to call people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma shook his head again. At this time, a doctor who had a round-the-clock ward rounded his head and looked at the information and walked in. He faintly felt the darkness of the front group and was immediately shocked. In the next second, a muzzle bent slightly outward, like a strange pistol pointed at his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the mask, a "beep" ban was heard, and he shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor slowly raised his hands and timidly retired. Mr. Kesma finally glanced at Alisa, who was biting her lip on the hospital bed. She was about to leave, and she spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the person of Doolin? That bastard! Give me my child back!", she struggled to get up, it seems that she is not afraid of this. Three people who are not good people at first glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Xerma frowned slightly, stepping over the leg and kicking it on Alisa's chin. The poor woman's brain shook and the body lost control and fell softly on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Xerma walked out of the room with the baby cradle, and he glanced at the doctor leaning against the wall of the corridor, slightly tilting his head. The doctor stunned and his face quickly revealed. He took off his eyes, turned around and pressed the wall against the wall to kiss the wall and the wall, and then slid to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a smart person, so Duling’s bastard should be a doctor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma’s whim, he quickly turned and left. Just as they had just left the hospital door, two cars with headlights suddenly appeared in the distance, and they drove quickly to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick man on the crown of the tree smiled and lifted the three-eyed scorpion. The gray-yellow gun has a layer of mysterious pattern on his body. A little behind the sight, aiming at the driver's seat of the first car, slowly pulled the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loud bang, a large piece of water vapor exploded in a moment, and he immediately slipped from the canopy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter is not good at all. This special shotgun produces a lot of water vapor and is too easy to expose itself. He blamed the old man for not wanting to follow his advice and slightly modified the gun. He re-selected a sniper position, swapped a sniper lens, and once again included the second car in sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver of the first car suddenly shocked, the whole cab was a bloody fog, the out of control car hit the outer wall of the hospital, completely broke down It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second car began to twist forward, and when it was not far from Mr. Zema, the loud noise came again, and the blood on the front windshield Pervasive, the driver looked down at the lower half of the body and could no longer lift his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma glanced at the crown of the tree across the road and looked at a camouflage person around him. "You son is good.", under the mask It was said that the little old man was full of smug laughter, but he couldn’t be beaten by Mr. Xerma in the next second. “I have my son ten...one percent.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
