			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thanked the commander for his kindness, and then left some of the local products to take the free front line and boarded the ship. There was a small accident during this period. At the moment of getting on the boat, Darcy might have realized that he was wrong. He wanted to escape and was shot by a soldier on his head. Immediately afterwards, a large piece of open insurance sounded, and Darcy, who had wanted to struggle, was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the training ship sailed out of the port, the waves and the undulating ships of the sea had already let these people completely confess, they were on the deck, a total of seventeen personal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When their hoods were taken off, almost everyone’s face showed a desperate look, and of course they knew they were not sailing in the Shudoun River. But on the sea. The gang on the East Coast has a word to complain about - don't provoke Du Lin on the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that Du Lin and the Navy were a traitor was an indisputable fact. The Navy loaded countless "legal" goods from the port of Irian into the transport ship and then sent it to the east. The port terminals around the coast are diverted to various places. As Du Lin has always done, both him and the Navy are legal. Because this is a legitimate business in itself, when does this business become illegal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these legitimate goods fall into the hands of illegal agents, this business becomes an illegal business, but this is with Du Lin. It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter to the navy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sale can continue until now, and there are already comprehensive countermeasures and contingency plans. No one wants to challenge Doolin’s business on the East Coast. It is a pity that they can't get more money to let the Navy betray Dulin, and they can't get rid of the fellowships in most cities. In the end, there will be no other endings except for the end of the death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the protection of the Navy, Doolin completely monopolized the private wine market on the East Coast, which is why people say that they should not provoke Du Lin on the sea. They can't beat the fellowship, and it's more likely to be the opponent of the navy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these people on the front line are now on the sea, in the sea of ​​Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat in a chair, and Thomas also made a parasol for him. In the shade of the parasol, Du Lin looked at Darcy. "I heard that you organized and planned the assassination for me. Is that true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darcy had a bit of a paste. He was just a humble little man. He was just a small person at the mercy of a big man. He didn't know how to answer Du Lin's question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second he will add a meal to the marine life of this sea fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that he has publicly admitted that there is no room for remorse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why he regrets after hanging up the phone. He is too weak, and there is no gap between the two behemoths. He thought that he was fast enough. If he could move to the mainland after Du Lin came to the east coast, he still had a chance to survive. After all, Du Lin and the Army are unfamiliar, and there is no such strong tyrannical strength and network in the Mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now everything is late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darcy smiled and looked up at Du Lin. "If I said that I am not voluntary, do you believe?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. "Letter, of course, I believe that the purpose of asking you today is that I want to know who ordered you to undertake this. There are no other people here. Live." As for not saying that there will be any Dulin not to say, Darcy must be very clear. Everyone who stunned Du Lin would end up dying in the end. The young man’s ironic wrist made him an underground emperor on the East Coast, and no one dared to offend him easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if you say it... Darcy is also desperate, he can't afford to punish Doolin. Is it a big man who offends him? ? No, he can't afford to be offended. Whether he confesses or doesn't explain it, he may end up in the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not explain, Du Lin will kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confessed, will let Du Lin and the big man and more people escalate the war, as he caused this to happen, there is no need to guess Very tragic end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many years ago, Darcy, who had just made a name for himself, thought about it too - what would he do in the face of the threat of death? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal is always beautiful, and how many people can face death calmly? His body was trembling slightly, his heart was struggling fiercely, and finally his eyes gradually became dim, as if he had lost his luster like a blind person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't say that his family still has a way to live, and it is really hard to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled miserably, looking at his companions, his lips shaking, and he said a "sorry" that he could hardly hear. He quickly bowed his head, and he could not face the surprised, angry, desperate eyes of his companions. He was a sinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin suddenly applauded, sparse applause made these people’s eyes fall on Doolin’s body, and some eyes filled with dead gray also flashed out. A glimpse of hope is full of hope. Perhaps the performance of Darcy touched Doolin, let the underground emperor touch his loyalty, so he would let them go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is actually just a trivial matter!" Du Lin’s tone seemed to be a bit wrong. There was some regret in it. He shook his head and hooked it to the side. I moved my finger. "In fact, this is really a trivial matter. You say what I need, and then I let you go. But why do some people want to complicate things? It is obvious that very simple things always have to be made. The accident came because I seem to be better talking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people were brought to the deck with a series of footsteps and wheezing, Darcy The whole person shook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have a wife and a child, three mistresses and two illegitimate children, your private life is very exciting!", Doolin praised As a matter of fact, "Now new choices are coming, survival or destruction are in your hands. You can choose to manage your mouth for someone who might marry you in some way, and then the family is neat together, too You can say it out quickly and find a way to compete for a chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Darcy, don’t want to die when you don’t die until the last person Come out, it will only make you more painful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darcy looked at those Duolin people who tied one heavy load to the feet of his woman and child. On the upper and lower waist, his eyes are about to come out of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Doolin’s use of his family as a means of threat, he can only give up all the insistence, “I say...”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just when Doolin left less than an hour, three boxes with the police investigation bureau logo appeared outside the gate of the police station. A guy with a face on the face of a man who was not allowed to enter was carrying four men. I stepped into the police station and found the police chief who was resting. "I want to take away the free frontline gang members suspected of assassinating senior Imperial officials. This is my document and the instructions for this action..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the police station waved his hand and did not borrow the documents and identity documents handed over by the agent. He said with a smile: "The Navy has taken those people away not long ago. Said that they may be suspected of committing a military crime."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man frowned. "I need to use the phone." After that, I kept staring at the police chief. The latter sighed a little, nodded, left his office, and deliberately closed the office door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this all about? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some unclear feeling on his face that turned into a severe expression at the moment he turned, and started a rare tour. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry is having some restlessness in the meeting. He even ignored the speech of a subordinate until his secretary coughed and he only returned to God. Come, "The results of this vote will be announced soon. I hope to see a good news. This has a direct relationship with your work during this time. If you do well, I will reward him and do bad people. There are also corresponding penalties." He raised his wrist and opened his sleeves, glanced at the arm on his wrist, and packed up the things on the table and stood up. "I have something at noon, today's meeting will be here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the secretary around him. "You put a record of today’s meeting and I will send it to my office." After that, he hurried. left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was near the office, he faintly heard the ringing of the phone ringing, speeding up the pace and pushing the office, and picked up the phone. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the No. 1 villa on Imperial Avenue, Magus is hosting a guest whose identity is so special that it is so special that Even he sat on the sofa instead of sitting in his chair in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time Soro did it too much, not only Solo, but others have been very over the past few years, no longer by them. Going on.", this guy looks like he is in his sixties, a silver hair, can't find a little bit of variegation. He is a little older, and he looks very spiritual and has a spiritual look than the average young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
