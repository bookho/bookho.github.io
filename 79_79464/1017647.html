			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small valley in the western wilderness, the lights are bright, there are large tents and people shaking. Here is one of the current positions of the Freedom Front. In the face of the active attack by the Western Military Region, they can only slow down their "liberation" cause and hide in the valley to wait for opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside a tent on the right in the middle of the valley, several men were drinking around a bonfire and eating barbecue. There is no shortage of food in the wilderness of the west. Both the hare and the coyotes can provide a large amount of ingredients to ensure that hunters with certain abilities do not starve to death on this land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know who is the richest?", speaking to a group of gold digger leaders who recently joined the Freedom Front, his name is Bresta, nickname "Sheriff." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold digger’s days in the west are not good, they don’t have enough capital to compete with the capitalists for mining rights, and they lack the plunder to mine the mines, but they Have a determination to die for money. They live in a variety of ways, most of the time playing a poor gold digger, and sometimes do not mind the identity of a robber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gold digger is not terrible, a group of gold digger is terrible, this is the experience of people in the wild to sum up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brest is such a person. He has helped others and has been helped by others. He is quite famous in the circle of gold diggers. Many people call him "Mr. Sheriff", saying that Mr. Brest, who is passionate and unrestrained, is always happy to help others. Some of the people who have received his help will follow him. Gradually Brest is surrounded by many gold diggers. They are self-contained. Although they are not listed in the west, they are in the circle of gold diggers. Still quite famous - the sheriff helped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just one aspect of Brest and the Sheriff’s help. They do help the gold digger, but how good they are for the gold digger, then How bad it is for people who are not gold digger. Robbery, theft, and looting are just things they have done. In the words of Sergeant Brest, the west should be the western part of the gold digger, a paradise for freedom. These capitalists used money to destroy their free country, and let the gold diggers who were once the masters of this free country, Became the bottom of the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he has no burden on the bad things that non-gold rushers have done, and sometimes he is proud of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time I heard that the slaves formed the Freedom Front to liberate the slaves in the mining area in the west. Brest thinks this is a very good opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, their goal is not a gold digger. For those mine owners and mine protection team Brest has absolutely no good feelings. Attacking them will not make him feel embarrassed. . Secondly, he also knows how many slaves are in the west. Even if only one-tenth of these slaves remain members of the Freedom Front Organization, the Freedom Front will leap to become the fourth force in the West and become the biggest winner in the West. One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a brief explanation of the nature of the gold digger. These people are coming to the west to explore the gold mine with the idea of ​​getting rich overnight. They are absolutely Not a good person standing on the moral mountain. For money, they can abandon their families and relatives to the west to fight and kill. This kind of person is not a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, their existence is for the sake of profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Freedom Front, Brest saw the benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the Freedom Front is too big, it will be difficult for the official to start with this organization because most of the organizations are slaves who have been deceived or kidnapped. Killing these people will trigger a frenzy of public opinion in the international arena, and at the same time, the relationship between the state and the country will deteriorate rapidly. Then when this group of people is unwilling to leave the West and to be rooted here, the official must recognize the organization and recognize the legal status of these people. At that time, it is when they harvest their interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speculators are never charitable, they are pursuing a dollar of investment, a return of 10,000. Once the Freedom Front is recognized, everyone is given equal treatment, they will win many mining areas, as a veteran figure, Brest will also live the life he wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pocket is full of money, continue to do his good deeds, do his bad things, and do the people he has never done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sentence made people around the campfire stunned. Who is the richest in the West? This is a question that does not have the correct answer, because not everyone I tell everyone how much money is in my pocket, how much money is in the bank, so I don't know how to answer it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around me were silent and couldn’t say the answer. Brest smiled. He shook his bottle and smiled. Looking at a few people on the side of the bonfire, "I want to say that the richest person is definitely the Dulin who has recently made a big splash." After he said that the mouth of the bottle was in his mouth, he poured a sigh of relief. Wine, Gudun Gudun's drink, Xiu's whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a good wine has to be sold at least 15 bottles or more in the bar. He can't afford it, but now he can drink unlimited amounts. In the battle a week ago, they levelled a remote mining area in the west. There was not much money, only a few thousand in cash, and there was a 100,000 bank ticket, but no one took it. That thing is to see at most, not to be taken seriously, whoever dares to go to the bank to withdraw money, who will certainly be caught. However, there are quite a few metal particles and metal powders that have been roughed, and they should be ready for trading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, the most rewarding is the living materials, as well as the wine. A total of fifty boxes, six hundred bottles of good wine, is said to be for the mine protection team and the supervisor to enjoy, just entered the goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These wines are now their drinks, so they can taste the good wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that after Du Lin’s name, he was still silent. Everyone was thinking about why Du Lin was the richest man in the West. After a while, Bray Ster spit out a drink and explained it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do I say that Du Lin is the richest person? Because Du Lin has just been defrauded by the West Mine’s group of shards. If it is You, how have you been deceived by more than 10 million people?", his problem is much simpler than the previous question. The people next to him immediately replied that they should kill the West Mine and everyone should also take one of them. Get back more than a million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded hard, poured another sip of wine, and then forced the wine and the bottle left in the bottle into the bonfire, and the flame swallowed. The moment of alcohol has some weakness, and it can be followed by a high flame. "Yes, kill them and get back their money. But do you know what Doolin did? He didn't do anything, this What does it mean? Explain that this more than 10 million is nothing to Du Lin!", he said a little embarrassed when he said this sentence, and under the bonfire, people looked at the bottom of the heart, "We are bitter." How many years have come to suffer, even the money to buy a bottle of wine is reluctant, and then look at those people, casually millions of tens of millions of money is like money is not out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This world is unfair, unfair!", he looked around the people, his chest was violently ups and downs, "Think about when we first came to the west, never slept A sense of stability, every day is fighting nature, fighting with each other, and those waving The ticket took away the capitalist fight in our mines. In the end, what did we get? Nothing, except for the scars and exhaustion of one, we have nothing!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"But they, but enjoy the life we ​​can't enjoy, it's not fair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side of the campfire, a guy with a cowboy hat is low Asked, "What are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brest smiled and he looked back at the tent in the camp and lowered his voice. "I heard some words that I shouldn't have heard when I went to pee yesterday. Amon and one person said that Doolin wants to see them recently. If Du Lin doesn't come, even if he comes, why don't we do one? Tickets? A Guar of a defeated country, it is not worth having so much wealth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people on his left suddenly became shocked, and also lowered the voice and looked around Go, "Would you like to leave here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave? Why? No!" Brest smiled twice. "We secretly did this." One vote, then continue to do our business here, when we have more money, here we will Enough to become a leading member, when the group of slaves of the Freedom Front is whitewashed, we should be human."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How, are there any? People are willing to follow me to do this vote?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonfire suddenly fell into a dead silence, after about three minutes, even Brest himself had a bit of retreat At the time, these people nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the tent that is only about 50 meters away from this group of people, Amon in the mouth of Brest is sitting in a chair. He is one of the ten warriors, a slave of Dulinte, Du The news that Lin wants to see them has already been known to the Ten Warriors, but now they also face a problem among the ten people, that is, the opinions are not uniform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people headed by Amon think they got Doolin’s pardon, and Doolin saved them, gave them new life and realized their lives. The opportunity of value should go to see Doolin and obey the will of Du Lin. But the four people led by Finlay have a very independent thought. Du Lin does have a favor for them. They will remember this, but what they have now is not what Du Lin gave them. They are through them. Hands, courage and even change with life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
