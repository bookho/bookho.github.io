			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things are like this, are you willing to take over?" Clark stood by the window and looked at the crowds on the street. These people were waving their hands. Not worth the stock certificate, waving his hands emotionally, snarling with red face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the DreamWorks suspension, these people were blocked at the door of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. They wanted the stockpile to give them a speech and give them a fair. These people have already counted their losses on the head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. Although the SFC does need to take certain responsibilities for this, it is not entirely responsible. Compared with the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the central bank’s trusteeship office should assume more responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp carefully looked at the information on the table. Every page of every page he looked very focused, it’s a good idea to miss any word, read it. Then he leaned back in the chair and thought about it, then shook his head, his expression and movements made Clark frown. Amp, who was introduced to him by the Imperial Police Preparedness Investigation Bureau, said that this person is very good at starting with details and then catching the criminals. In the case accepted by Amp, in addition to the gold robbery has not been detected, his broken case is 100%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the Teel Gold Robbery has not been successfully detected so far, its main responsibility should not be taken by Amp, this case is not his host He was only a consultant at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Golden Robbery, Amp spent four months cracking the Orodo metamorphosis serial killer and sent a teacher to the hanging This case was even included in the list of compulsory prosecutors. He was later transferred to the Imperial Capital, and some old cases were cracked. Now there is a very high popularity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp sighed. "I picked it up, but I have some requirements. If I can't, I can only say sorry."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say!" Clarke embraced Amp, who stood in the corner of the wall and looked at the sofa. He wanted to hear how big the prosecutor, known as the empire, was. ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First!", Amp wrote the numbers and contents on a blank piece of paper, and read it out, "All agencies must be unconditional." Cooperate with my work!", he looked up at Clark, who nodded. "Second, I need the imperial central bank to cooperate with our work. This requires coordination. You are looking for someone."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no problem with this article."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Third, I must protect my life until the end of the investigation."<br /><br />&nbsp Anpp sighed. The reason why he shook his head was that he smelled a dangerous atmosphere. This group of mad people squandered more than 70 million funds from the stock market. All kinds of channels may have flowed out of the country before entering the federal financial system. Perhaps this case is not only the participation of imperial people, but also forces from outside the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once they know someone is chasing after their ass, I am afraid they will immediately kill. The money is enough for a lot of people to be crazy and to kill or kill for the money. He is a prosecutor with a sense of justice and there is nothing wrong with it, but that does not mean that he will bury his own life for this case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark thought for a moment and finally nodded. "We will apply for professional soldiers to protect your safety."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp stood up helplessly, "If this case didn't attract me, I would never pick it up. Ok, let's get started!" He walked Next to the white wall, I took out a pen and drew it directly on the wall. While painting, I said that my expression was very focused. "In fact, the case can be simplified into two steps. The first step is to find clues. The first step is to crack the guess. The DreamWorks stock was originally set up to create a scam, so we need to find the first one to contact Fire Dragon Entertainment and buy the company!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent a simple head outline on the wall and then said hello inside, "The money to buy this company cannot be cash, no one will use it." Cash to buy a company, so we have to find the money The beginning of the source, whether the money was from domestic or from abroad, are sure there will be a detailed record. "He drew a wad of money and circle abstract a" 1 ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After DreamWorks was acquired, they took out some materials to prove that they own the industries. If this is not their fiction, they will leave enough clues. This is also very important. The key to the detection of many cases is to make breakthrough developments in such almost insignificant clues, to see if they have any cooperation objects, find these people!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark looked at Anpu's crazy "painting" on the wall like a master of painting. He finally understood the necessity and correctness of Anpu. Through the development of the relationship map drawn by Amp, Clark has already "knowed" how the case should be detected. Even he has a feeling that he can have this case as long as he has this painting. Broke it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this unrealistic idea was quickly thrown away by him. He knew that all this is the strength of Amp, simplifying but not simple. The process made Clark full of confidence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the federal seaside city of Florigos, Joshua was tired from the cruise and he legally stepped after checking his passport. Got the land of the federation. He seems calm at this time, but his heart is like a wave. With 71.41 million, the money passed through thousands of accounts and entered an unnamed account of the First Bank of the Commonwealth. For this reason, he will receive a large sum of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin said his ideas and plans, Joshua immediately agreed, and he knew that he could not return to this life. The empire goes, but he doesn't care. As for the hatred of the past, he also put it down, and even he can say that he is happy. Happy is not only the money that belongs to him in his account, but also this fraud case will become an important part of the imperial financial system, and will be continuously taken out by people as a lesson to pass on to the newcomers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very likely that the students in the future Imperial Finance Institute will know his name because his name will be printed on the book – the largest in the Imperial stock market. The scam page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the customs, I greeted a taxi. He had arranged all the things before, including buying a very luxurious set in Florigos. Villa. At the moment he got into the car, his inner ups and downs were slightly calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the Tianpingshan villa area!", he said a bit of awkward federal words and the driver said, the federation is more developed than the empire, to be advanced, once After the imperial emperor and the merchants' alliance that the aristocrats looked down gave them a heavy blow, they realized that the times have changed, and the world is no longer their final say. Joshua sighed as he looked at the vehicles on the street and the pedestrians on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where he will live and be old in the future... The air seems to be fragrant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
