			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has a lot of shortcomings, not a good person, but one thing he is still good, that is, does not destroy the family. He vowed that he had never done this man's wife, so he suspected that this guy had mistaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as I know, I have not maintained an abnormal relationship with any married woman. If you think that what happened to me and your wife, then It must be that you are looking for the wrong person." Du Lin just prepared to let Keelan loose the idiot, but suddenly he remembered something, "What is your wife?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The man spurred a name, a person that Du Lin knew, and rolled up sheets together last night - Natalie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin suddenly wanted to laugh when he heard the name, and then he made a call to Natalie and told her what was happening here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natalie didn’t know what happened when she got the call, when Doolin told her that there was a man who said she was her husband and was tracking her own At that time, Natalie remembered the actor who had become her nightmare and was a disgusting nightmare, and her ex-husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natalie and the guy named Danny did think Danny was a good person before the divorce, or before she found the man’s many shortcomings. Have a handsome appearance, but also very considerate and gentle, always let yourself feel that family life is much more happy than those sisters and sisters said. But since the rumors came out, she realized that Danny, whom he usually saw, played him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tracks himself, peeks at his diary and desk while he is at work, and messes up her underwear, in order to prove that she can rise The job is because of the sale of the body. In the end, the two men broke up. After breaking up, Danny everywhere promoted her sale of the hue. The boss was discovered by him, so he abandoned her. It seems that in order to prove that he is the victim, almost all of Natalie's relatives have been harassed by Danny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until she came to Otis in the same way, she got rid of the disgusting guy, but she didn’t think that Danny actually caught up here. Also committed in the hands of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explanation on the phone was unclear. Natalie quickly came to the warehouse behind the security company according to the address that Du Lin gave her, and saw herself holding herself. The broken palm of the palm of the four fingers broke. At the moment she saw him, Natalie felt an anger continually tearing her heart. She went to Du Lin's side with the anger of her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that I heard the sound of high-heeled shoes. Danny looked up and looked up. He saw Natalie’s moment and wanted to stand up, but he was pressed back by one hand and continued to kneel on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Natalie... Listen to me, tell them I don't want to do anything, I just want to see you, that's it.", As he pleaded, he moved his knees forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was frightened this time. He used to go to Natalie’s boss, but Natalie was not sure. This is also the real reason why Natalie was transferred to Otis, not because her boss wants to submerge her to be rejected by her, and when she is angry, she kicks her to the place where the bird does not pull. If you want to play with the female subordinates, you will be transferred. I am afraid that the majority of the employees of this official are men and cannot become an official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Private life is part of an official visit. Officials with a confusing private life and negative influences are not only unable to get promoted, but may also be cleared out of the ranks of officials. Of course, this refers to the underlying officials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Natalie’s boss, he not only provoked the man, but also insulted the other party, but the other party could not even put a fart, only Going back to the office and pretending to be inaudible, and then giving him some benefits in private. So he thinks that this young man who works in the city hall will not be as good as Natalie’s former boss, unless he does not want his job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal is always wonderful, the reality is often cruel, he not only kicked on the iron board, but also kicked in a car On the triangular iron of the head of the fast-moving steam locomotive, the body was broken and instantly broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are divorced..." Natalie lowered her head and explained, "This man has long had nothing to do with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. "I remember the last time you said it." Du Lin is really remembering this. After all, he just came to the city of Otis. At that time, there were just a few people in the entire city hall. He always wanted to know what the background of these limited people was, why he was transferred to the city of Otis, and Natalie was among those he knew. It’s just that he didn’t listen to Natalie’s, but listened to Thomson’s, so to save some unnecessary trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most troublesome thing to do in the official system is the gossip. Once something like this happens, a lot of work will be caused by hostility and distrust between each other. The extension is completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's better for us to listen to this...Danny's thoughts." Du Lin asked Natalie for advice and then asked: "Mr. Danny, what is your purpose in Otis? Nata Ms. Li has already said that you are divorced. In law, you are no longer a husband and wife, but two independent natural persons with complete powers. Please don’t deceive me. My temper is sometimes not so good.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny, who was scared early, said it in a brain. The purpose of his coming here is because he has no money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Natalie and his divorced, what was not taken away except for his own clothes and jewelry he bought, he was left to this man. . Sometimes people are like this, they are hurt to a certain extent, and they are willing to give up everything and just want to leave that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the divorce, Danny had a happy time. He was a victim and went to bed with several of Natalie’s former colleagues. This is actually not what strange things. He is very handsome in himself, and the kind of temperament that hurts and hurts can really attract the attention of some women. After spending the days of this romantic, he cohabited with a female colleague of Natalie and confirmed the relationship. It seems that the new life is beckoning to him, but he accidentally discovered his "fiancée" and his own A good friend got it together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This discovery made him extremely angry, he felt as if he had been deceived, so he beat the woman and paid the price for it - Three thousand pieces of compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the time he didn’t think about a stable life, he lived a long life in the bar, until one day, he and a technology After the night, the girl found his bank vouchers and all the valuable things in the house disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was deceived and deceived by a skilled woman. From this time on, this guy has inexplicably misunderstood a woman, gradually he The economy had problems. In the end, I had to sell the house to maintain my life. Until I finally used up the last bit of savings on my hand, I remembered that I might find a way to get money from Natalie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he went to find Natalie’s boss "theory", in order to avoid the expansion of the situation, his boss finally blocked his mouth with money. He thinks this may be a chance to make money. He has been in Otis for five days. In addition to starting to track Natalie to find her current home, she is staring at other people who may have a leg with his ex-wife until this morning. Dooling came out of Natalie's house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
