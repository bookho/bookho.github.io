			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the morning, Suri and Merlin got up and saw Duo Lin, who was a bit ugly, and several other middle-aged people. Last night, Du Lin did not sleep for almost overnight, until all the relationships and cooperation methods were completely settled after the day was already bright. As the initiator of this matter, Du Lin had two kings and queens to protect him. The Chamber of Commerce also stood on Doolin. Harry and Maggs expressed their waiver. Finally, Du Lin took the advantage of being a good one. The dominance of this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The necessary supervision is definitely there. Do not necessarily do anything to do it yourself. Du Lin only needs to take charge of a general direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breakfast is a buffet. Watching up to forty kinds of fine food on the long table, Suri’s only feeling is that the stomach is too small. The skin is also thinner. During the meal, Suri has been carefully reminding me of what Merlin should be, not being able to do anything to be rude. The clever girl has not experienced such a squad in person, but she is very familiar with this set of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s eyes are also mild to her, and Merlin’s knowledge and familiarity with this society is still far from enough, and one needs to be reminded by one person. What is his world like? Originally this job should be him, or Mason to complete, but two people are very busy and have no such time, but fortunately there is such a role in Merlin's side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin can easily see that this is a girl who worships gold. He does not dislike such a girl. He pursues the life he wants and has no relationship with others. Need to be accused and harsh from society. It's like most men like young girls. It's a kind of behavior similar to “golden” for girls. Men can show off power besides money, and girls can show off besides beautiful. The face is also only a moving body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why do men like young and beautiful girls and pursue these things, but girls can’t like men who have money or power? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not fair! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, Du Lin feels that as long as he can maintain his current status, Suri will not do anything to hurt Merlin - because only hold Merlin tightly. She has the opportunity to enter the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a blank business card holder, pulled out a small card with some black patterns, wrote a phone number, and signed his name and handed it to Su Rui. "This is me." Now, if you have any problems that you can't solve, you can call me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surrey’s treasure will put Du Lin’s business card on her. Into the pocket, grinning and nodding, the tears of excitement are coming out. She has realized that an unprecedented door is opening to her. She just has to do what she is supposed to do, and she may have the opportunity to enter the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This door is called "the giants" in the world of ordinary people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin looked strangely at Dooling, and Du Lin picked up the empty plate as if he didn’t see the question hidden in Merlin’s eyes, and said with a smile: “The lobster is good, Very fresh, do you want to try it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some things will never be forgotten once they are engraved in the bones, erased, three brothers at home" The tacit understanding fostered by the tyranny of Mr. Xerma is absolutely difficult to replicate. Merlin also stood up and stood up, and the two went to the food station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little distance from the table, Merlin whispered, "Do you think she is good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Du Lin didn't look at him, but focused on picking food, his lips moving slightly. "She can help you get to know the upper class faster and join in. I don't think there is anything wrong with this. In fact, it is very simple. She only wants a rich life, and will maintain this enjoyment of unlimited tolerance. You will understand everything after a while. If you meet other women you like later. I don't need to get rid of her, just need to do it myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't deceive Merlin in this regard, from the reaction of the housekeeper And Du Lin’s observation, this girl who marries the rich is actually very suitable as a marriage partner. Of course, all of this has a premise, the man must be strong enough, and the girl will never touch it. The upper limit. Before they still know how high the sky is, they will plead for all the injustices to maintain this feeling and life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the world of rich people is really good! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you know a woman well?” Merlin glanced at the lobster on the table, about a foot long. The shrimp shell was a cooked shrimp ball. He put a lot of it in the plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Understanding, I don't know women, but people!" Du Lin smiled and picked some dishes back to the table. He glanced at the heap of food in the Merlin plate and couldn't help but smile. "Your expression tells me that you have a different opinion about this because she is not the first time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin didn’t talk, and Du Lin shook his head and said, “A layer of skin is just a matter of time. After that, you will understand that some things don’t have any practical meaning or value.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a hard time believing that my younger brother who has lived together for more than a decade is now value and interest. Are you Dulin I know?" Merlin asked a question, although his words are not many, but sometimes it is difficult to make people fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders and stared at his brother. "Life has changed me and will change you. I firmly believe this!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two returned to the table to continue dining, and the excited Suri did not notice that someone was standing by their table, and she was a little bit when the other person spoke. Raised his head and then widened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry drove up late yesterday night, this matter is too important after all, the political events and interests involved are too many, his nephew can not represent him at all, This big thing. Therefore, he must be present in person, and also represents the position and interests of Magus in the negotiations and meetings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also a listless look at this time, working for a day to drive a few dozen kilometers of cars and staying up late to discuss the details, so that he can not afford to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you mind if I sit down?", the plate he was holding had only a few slices of bread and cheese, and a cup of packaged juice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin let a little space open, Harry sat down, and he yawned and complained, "You should inform me earlier, so I can Pushing away other things, you don't know that in the middle of the night, I have shit in my head and almost fell asleep!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such an unsightly vocabulary as the great man of the governor, Suri confirmed that she had come into contact with the life she had dreamed of. Harry looked at Suri and Merlin and said hello, while eating something, said: "Is the thing on your side already spread out?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I have already arranged for someone to do it. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "I?", Harry couldn't help but smile. "I don't have any idea, but someone will definitely have an idea." He thought that the ugly face of the guy last night couldn't help but smile. "You have a very good plan. Really."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Harry finished eating, he asked Mr. Jack to ask for a driver. He had to rush back to canvass for the election. He was able to sleep on the road. meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things that have been finished are also finished. A big person who Suri knows or doesn’t know and Du Lin’s farewell leave, which makes Du Lin’s Her position is higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also needs to rush back to Otis, Mr. Jack arranged for the vehicle to leave them, and watched the train carrying Doolin leave the platform, Su Rui and Mei Lincai go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin is thinking about what Du Lin said to him, will life change him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not very clear, if he will, he hopes that he can become better, if it is not actually good, then he is real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suri around him is thinking about other things, besides showing off with the little sisters, she is thinking about whether to resign and concentrate on doing a good job. Merlin's work here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, work is better than marrying a giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing big happened in the next few days until something unexpected happened suddenly, and something changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Colliers would help Du Lin get through the mountains and east of the east and west, build a railway, but when the project was still in design, Colliers suddenly Lost consciousness fainted in the company. The whole company suddenly became a mess, and even more troublesome was that during his coma, the doctor gave a pessimistic diagnosis report, and family members began to fight for power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
