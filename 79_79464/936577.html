			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we do something with Doolin's work some time ago?", Solo sat in the magnificent room, everything here was full A distinguished atmosphere. The walls are all gold and red. It is said that these golden colors are not mineral dyes. They are the best goldsmiths in the empire. They knock the gold into gold foil thinner than paper and then paste it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a manual fee, it costs tens of thousands of super-high rewards, not to mention the gold foil and the expensive art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the residence of Prince Komos, and later Prince Komoz was "by" yin chaos after the palace was hanged with the empress, Prince Komos The mansion was taken over by the royal family, including all the property of Prince Komos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the Empire’s Imperial Judicial Interpretation Office distorted some laws and common sense, and made the death of Prince Komorz unclear, although it may be It was a royal scandal and the biggest false and wrong case in the history of the empire, but the imperial royal family removed the last non- royalty prince and stabilized all power. From a political point of view, this has nothing to do with the development of the entire empire and the rule of the royal family. As for the shame of the judiciary, it has nothing to do with the royal family. After all, the emperor is also a person who abides by the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new party coming to power, the treasury that originally belonged to the imperial royal family became the national treasury of the entire empire. After losing this important treasury, the royal family could not maintain a luxurious life. Like many emperors at the end of the dynasty, the emperor is now starting to become a seller to maintain his decent life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residence of Prince Komos is one of the first assets to be sold, and the Duke of the North, who guards the North, paid for the manor. And the money that was taken is twice the price of the royal family. His Majesty also rewarded the North Dagong with a “Holy Gold Medal” in recognition of her loyalty to the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, of course, there is no big man. The army of the nobility has been incorporated into the army by the new regime and transferred to the south to avoid any possibility. Restoration and riots. The estate is now a private property of the “Fatima family” and is the headquarters of the Fatima Group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the North Dagong is a woman who once fell down at the age of seventeen in the riots of the old era to suppress the free people. One hundred and seventy-four heads shocked the entire empire, and it was also called "the holy woman holding the flame". The "Saint Virgin" is now 69 years old, but the body is still very tough and the owner of the Fatima Group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soro appeared here for the family business, and the chorus consortium intends to join forces with the Fatima Group to create a brand new one that catches up with the Otis city. At this point, they have already heard some rumors from Magus. The city of Otis has more than 10 million taxes per month. This has greatly stimulated the top of the new party. They don’t need to find money from anywhere. Brains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of the empire is vast and innocent, a SAR can never satisfy the consumer group of the entire empire, and even a 10% consumer group may not be able to get it. More than three, even if more than five will not have much impact on the city of Otis, but each month has tens of millions of profits and taxes. The money can be used in a very large number of places, and some plans that have been put on hold can continue. It is said that several secret projects in the military have already begun to apply for further research and development funds, and it may be because of this matter that Maggs looks like this. Make a hasty decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Magus intends to open three more SARs, the consortiums who have already seen the benefits of the SAR will not stand on the sidelines as before. I missed the best opportunity to enter, so that Du Lin quickly grew up so much that they couldn't even intervene if they wanted to intervene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Fatima family is willing to work with the hymn consortium or with the Cape family, they are very likely to be able to win a major SAR Most of the management rights, resulting in huge profits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are smart, Doolin can pay 10 million taxes a month, which means he can have at least two to three million to three Five million yuan of income, those businessmen can also get enough profit, these data analysis until the last home of the Cape family is tempted, and then promoted this trip, let Solo come to talk with the biggest forces in the North Let me talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, everyone belongs to the old aristocrats of the North and should be able to have a harmonious atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting for the heirs of this generation of Fatima family, Soro talked about this with Ornes in the lounge. Dooling was the stain that he couldn't erase in his life, let him lose his face, and some people in the family were watching his jokes and watching the jokes of the old master. After all, the old master volunteered to talk to Du Lin, but Du Lin refused his proposal, so that his face could not come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that Soro has a chance to appear here. Mr. Cape now knows that Solo will not be convinced. He uses Soro's dissatisfaction to let him do his best to promote this matter and prove his ability to "revenge" Dolin's past hatred. It's better to have more power than no power, and it's this extra power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ornes raised his hand to cover his mouth and nose. The ghost knew that no one was listening to them. He stared at the door and whispered, "I feel that the conscience reporters are going to trace a wave, then Exposing Du Lin to the exposure, and then launching a public opinion attack, let him be discredited. At that time, even if Magus wanted to keep him, it was a very difficult thing, he could only choose to transfer him to other places, a section of snow. Time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the limelight has passed, they will consider reviving Doolin. The mayor of Otis has the possibility of operating during the vacuum period. The Donald's member is very kind to us. We can instigate some of the power to take him to the mayor's position and then serve us. As long as he can come to power, plus our prestige and cooperation with the Fatima family. The effect, the city of Otis will change its position in an instant..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ouines put down his hand and stood up, and Soro also followed. Get up, bring the perfect smile, and greet the door . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl who looks only 17 or 18 years old, with white gold hair reflecting the chandelier’s radiance, and some soft colors on the silk Decorations. She wore a deep purple dress and there was an inexplicable gas field when she appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The graceful and elegant girl’s liveliness, and the illusion of being self-defeating, as if she is perfect, everything is perfect, including one The white gold curled body hair hidden under the clothes is also perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on her face soon bloomed, and the awe-inspiring atmosphere in the room came from the harsh winter to the summer when everything recovered, and also made Soro and Ernest loose. Take a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sneak a sneak peek at the heart, and the emotions and amazements in their hearts do not need to be said. People say that in the north, the Fatima family is the king here, and it seems that it is not fake. Such an imposing Soro has only been seen in the immediate royal family at the time of the adult rite! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, Soro fainted, and Ornes had already bent down, "Miss Felicia..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felika, that is, the girl outside the door speeded up a bit, walked to the front of Solo and gently supported his arm, the sound is like a lark flying from heaven to earth. Clear and translucent, "Mr. Soro, you are too polite, I should also call you Uncle Soro according to the seniority."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
