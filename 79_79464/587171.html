			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think so.", Chowdor walked up and down in the room, he blinked, wondering why the eyelids had been Jumping. He has been thinking about a problem, Cod, Ken, where are they going? He has already launched all his power to find them where they can be found, but they are just like missing, disappearing silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed Prando’s arrangement and found three uncomfortable guys from the bottom of the gang, promising to give them up once they came out. Captain, give them a sum of money. He also followed the request of Prando to shape the three uncles, and there has been no bad news until now. He and Prando are a group. If he wants to be unlucky, Prando can't run away. Without his cooperation, Gotall can't be fooled by three plausible people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that he always feels that something is not quite right, but he can’t think of so many things in his mind, he can only become more and more annoyed. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to ask Wood, but he thinks that Prando said to him privately, and denied the idea. Wood has been "eliminated". In fact, he has been eliminated since he could not solve this problem very well. The people behind him can't help a person who can't do even a small thing. What the big men need is a good tool, not a tool to trouble themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedore has been able to go smoothly this way for many years, in addition to his own efforts, as well as the above boss appreciation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time he was just the lowest level of the gang, and several equally young teenagers parked outside the theater for the big guys, watching cars and washing horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a rainy day, a big man came out of the carriage, a servant opened a black umbrella for him, covering his face Strict and solid. He only saw the beautiful suit on his partner, the shiny boots at his feet, and the white scarf hanging around his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big man trampled on a pool of water when he got off the carriage, and the turbid sewage left some stains on his beautiful high-end leather boots. Just when others didn't know what to do, Codor had a chance to move. He was kneeling at the foot of the big man, braving the rain, lowered his head, and wiped the other's leather boots with his sleeves. When he looked up, there was only a slightly hoarse voice in his ear asking him - what is your name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed his ecstasy in his heart and revealed a smile that he thought was the most perfect. He returned to him - Codor, my name is Codor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big man walked directly into the theater in his sly expression, as if it was just a boring time in his life that was not worth the trouble of leaving in his mind. In the face of the strange vision of his companions, Godor just walked back to the eaves at the entrance of the theater from the heavy rain, waiting silently for his next opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the ninth day, a guy in a windbreaker with a courtesy found him and asked him a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you dare to kill?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon nodded hard, "Dare, Use a knife to lick it here and die!" He reached out and put a finger on his chest. The man gave him a note with two names, an address and time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only thirteen-year-old Gotol cast the only kitchen knife that can be used to cut vegetables and wear very seriously. One person is next to the well behind the house. , grinding the knife for the night. The next day he did not rest, went directly to the place on the note, and then quietly waited for two people to change their own destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that day on, Codor has a backing and has his achievements today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a good-natured person, but he is definitely the best knife for those big guys. His boss told him that if there were no surprises, he would support Gotall as the director of the Tenel Regional Police Department after two years of elections, but before that he had to let himself clean the dirty things on his body. Then pick out an inheritor who is equally obedient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not good at brainstorming, so most of what he needs to do is obey and follow. After thinking about it, he decided to ask the boss for his opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unremarkable car slowly stopped in a lane, and the two patrolmen were just about to come over and tell the driver that they could not park here, they saw the car. The sign, very wise choice to shut up, silently walk away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Godall walked through the alley, walked two streets, and walked outside a house not far from the city hall, knocking on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
