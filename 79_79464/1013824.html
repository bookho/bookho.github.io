			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I went to work in the morning, the doorman called to meet an executive member of the West Mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest level of the organization of the Western Mining Association is the "Western Mining Development Committee Executive Committee", consisting of a total of seven executive members, these executive members are from the West Mine The secondary structure of the meeting, the “Western Mining Committee”, was elected, followed by members and associate members. Strictly speaking, there were only three levels, and the boundaries between members and associate members have long become blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven executive members of the Executive Committee are responsible for the daily work arrangements and operations of the Western Mining Association. They formulate relevant planning objectives and then hand them over to the Western Mining Commission. Execution and implementation, it seems that the well-structured and well-regulated West Mine has a very serious problem, that is, the executives are over-powered. At the beginning of the establishment of the Western Mines, they adopted some institutions and regulations from the federal government, but these things may be useful in the federal, but not necessarily useful in the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplest, according to the regulations, every four years, the West Mine will have a general election, but in fact, those executives have not Changed because they have too much power and resources in their hands. At its simplest point, almost all of the important resource connections of companies and mine owners who have been successfully traded by the West Mine will be in the hands of the executive committee. It is not that the replacement of the executives will not be able to continue trading, but it will definitely be affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plus the executive committee and the committee, and gradually acquiesced to the fact that they are no longer willing to change the current situation easily. Let the West Mine regard the West as its own small kingdom. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The executive who met with the farmer called Matthew, forty-seven years old, holds five mining areas in his hand and is not an ordinary metal mine. He has a copper mine, a bauxite mine, two silver mines and a gold mine. It is said that the gold mine and a silver mine in his hand were not discovered by his own exploration team, but by the auction, the case of at least two mines being blood-washed may involve the big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew ranks fourth in the Executive Committee of the Western Mining Association, and the seemingly united West Mine will actually struggle internally. After all, the mines in the west More, it must be discovered by people. The existing mineral deposits are not enough to supply the entire empire, and every major empire will import a large amount of ore from other countries. Therefore, "mineral resources" is equal to money, power, and the more resources that can be allocated in the hands, the more straight the waist will be when the speaker speaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospective farmer was planning to meet two or three executive members, but unfortunately, the person he wanted to meet casually found some to hear that he was an excuse to refuse to come, and only one Matthew was coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Xiu wore a dark brown vest with a gray formal dress and a black courtesy. His face is very blunt, even if it is a smile, it will make people feel skeptical. This guy is from the heart who wants to laugh out, or in order to perfuse what can not be squeezed out of a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Mennon, good morning!", Matthew took the initiative to take off the gloves and put it on the table, reaching out and the doorman shook hands, then sat down. The exchange of the farmer, "I don't know if there is anything I need or what the West Mine will do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mennon laughs very happy, just like the West Mine has never The hard top made him not come to Taiwan. He also asked the secretary to make coffee for Matthew. "When I was in the hospital yesterday, I went to see Mr. Doolin. Mr. Doolin expressed a very strong indignation to me. He thought that the assassination. His assassin is likely to come from the West Mine, and also told me that he intends to get back the money he was cheated by you by prosecution, more than 11 million!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know who is wrong with this matter, I don't care too much about what this event will eventually become, but I must say the ugly words in front, if the West Mine will There was a very unfriendly friction between Mr. Doolin, so whoever has the loudest voice, I will catch anyone.", the tough words are finished The tone of the doorman has eased a lot. "Du Lin has proposed two solutions. First, you have apologized all over the country and paid for the loss suffered by Mr. Doolin. This is the end of the matter." (No typo In the form of a manuscript, an apology message was published in the national publication, so the draft was not a notice.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew snorted, "There is still a way? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is another way to decide how to resolve this dispute through litigation. But I don't think this is the best way. Lin Biao has never lost, and you will not only lose your decent face, but also lose your underwear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matthew couldn’t help but talk: "Please forgive me for being rude. I also express my sympathy for the things that happened to Mr. Doolin, but these things have nothing to do with the West Mine. This is his transaction with the mine owners. It has nothing to do with us. Mine is not We sold it to him, we are just responsible for the matchmaking. Bridge, and a sign of place, nothing more "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;! & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"And, I need to affirm that this incident was not passed on the Executive Committee. It is an independent act of a few people, not related to the West Mine, and they are already dead."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have reason to suspect that their death is related to Mr. Doolin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mennon has not been angered after being offended, he The smile said: "But Mr. Doolin still thinks that their death is related to the killing of the West Mine!", looking at what Matthew still wants to say, the doorman waved his hand. "Okay, I am only responsible for After all, this is happening in my city, I need to inform you and the West Mine. As for how to do it is your business, but there is one point, no force conflict is allowed, this is the bottom line!" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the farmer say that he has been mixed up in the political arena for several years, and he can’t understand anything, and Doolin’s words are that he wants him to go to the west. The mine will then do it from the hands and feet. The doorman has already seen Doolin, and that is a despicable and shameless villain. He always secretly seeks for his own interests after he has been involved in the competition. But this time, he will be disappointed, because the doorman does not intend to follow Du Lin's ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to burn the fire, not to burn the firewood, to provoke the nerves of the West Mine to let them fight with Du Lin, no matter who loses who wins There is no harm to the benefit of the doorman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Mine will lose, he will pick out a step on behalf of justice and fairness, so that the West Mine will never turn over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin lost, he continued to suppress the Western Mining Association with the image of the Western Mining Association’s “rudeness”, to gather their sphere of influence, and then to Du Lin Kick out the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only needs to watch quietly, and occasionally fill a firewood and throw it into the fire. Why bother to go down with these people? That is what rude people will do. He is a civilized person. He always tells himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew was mad at the departure from the City Hall. He did have some dissatisfaction with the other executives. He thought that everyone obviously put themselves in the distribution of rights and interests. Got a lower position. However, he also knows that the threat of internal struggle is far less than the attack from the outside. The internal struggle can be turned into a kind of positive and orderly competition. Everyone will have a limit, and it will be the next time. When you are interested, you should eat less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no limit to the threat from the outside. They will have the life of the West Mine. They will break up the West Mine and throw them into the trash to become the garbage of the era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of external threats such as Doolin and the Mennon, the West Mine will be very united inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew went back to the West Mine in the morning and told the doormen to tell him about the remaining four executives. Good method, because they did lose money this time. At the same time, he also misinterpreted Du Lin’s character. In their opinion, Du Lin’s person, even if he suffered a loss, would bite his teeth and add a job that he had just been dismissed because of an accident. The low tide period is a kind of bully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just didn’t expect him to scream out when he ate, which made people a little off guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are many group companies afraid to shout out? Because they can't afford the loss of image, this intangible asset is equivalent to money for all capitalists, and even more valuable than money. An excellent stockbroker will only tell his client how much he has earned for himself. He certainly will not take the initiative to say something stupid, "I let my client go bankrupt." Big companies, big capitalists are the same, they need to ensure that their image in front of people is perfect, full, and only then will people continue to believe that this is a good company and a group of outstanding leaders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people discussed the results of the morning and did not discuss the results. The only thing that can be said is that the mine owners will return the money to Doolin and apologize. It is absolutely impossible. And all of this must be done in private, not exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, they also analyzed the lively thoughts of the Mennon through analysis and swearing curses, they will not let the doormen's minds succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, Matthew and another executive ate a light meal in the restaurant of the West Mine, during which he cursed the doorman and ate it. After dinner, he will go to the City Hall and the Mennon to communicate and see if they can follow the idea of ​​them and find a way that everyone can accept to end this matter as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the doorman is not planning to be a middleman and rejects Matthew’s request, which makes Matthew’s departure from the City Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
