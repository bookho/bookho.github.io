			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new era, the empire has many problems, social problems, and institutional problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a problem unique to the empire. Almost all countries currently have many problems. The development of science and technology is too fast. It is the word of the country. In the international environment, it has become smaller, and more and more things that cannot keep up with the times have begun to become cumbersome. However, these cumbersome things are the most important things in each country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Empire, class solidification is the biggest problem, no one. When Magus came to power, he immediately abolished the class, no longer used a clear label to poke the seal of "class" on everyone's face, and divided people into three or six. People can't call a tramp a public, but the word "people" really disappeared from the hearts of the middle and upper classes of the empire because people didn't say it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course no, the class still exists, and in a more secret way, the society is divided into three or six, etc., and the people are divided into three or six. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are similar problems in the Union. In fact, their problems are more serious than the Empire, because they existed in the capitalist society from the beginning. With the deadly forest law effect, if you want to grow and want to grow, you must swallow the weak. The cruel competitiveness of the free market has made many big capitals stand out. They have become monsters. Whenever there are people or companies that may challenge their qualifications in the future, they will start the annexation process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquisition, or persecution, there is always one that suits them, either as part of the monster's body or disappearing into the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More trouble is that the top leaders of the federation, especially the parliamentary parliament, each of them is a consortium, each representing a huge capital force, they also In doing the same thing, they continue to swallow up businesses and consortia with potential or rapid growth to avoid risks, but in the years that followed, these tricks were less common. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too much young consortiums are rapidly expanding and expanding, and they are connected by associations, such as community organizations such as Golden Shield, which fight together The attacks from the giants on the top of the tower have now stood firm and have the potential to try to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the federal government to divide the entire government system into two is to prevent the penetration of capital by the government. In the past two hundred years, if the Speakers of the Joint Parliament did not have absolute control over the country, the Union may have been torn apart. The governors of each state are almost the heads of the new consortium. They are all locals, have huge industries, employ more workers, and they only support independent ideas. The following people will support them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the federal system has become two separate but intersecting systems in response to this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These problems don’t seem to be sharp enough now, and the contradictions are not fully revealed in front of people’s eyes, because in this new era, there are business opportunities everywhere. Everywhere is gold. The consortium within the federation focused its attention on economic interests, temporarily evading the collision with the traditional notification forces and continuing to accumulate strength. This is also why the unprecedented prosperity of the federal economy in these years, under the surface of these prosperity, is actually full of contradictions and differences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old rulers are reluctant to give up their power, and the new challengers are eyeing them, ready to go back and smash them into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war that was suddenly launched by the empire was a blend of contradictions and differences between the major forces within the Federation, and these conflicts were temporarily put out by exporting wars. I pressed it down, but this does not solve these problems, only to make everyone temporarily settle down. In the past few years, the contradictions have warmed up again. The federal government and consortiums have formulated new plans to temporarily press the current contradictions in the form of exporting "economic warfare", so that the federal shield becomes the world settlement currency. one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what should I do when the problem is reincarnation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contradiction has always existed and has been constantly put aside because various policies and actions have been put aside. This does not mean that contradictions will disappear. During this long period of time, these contradictions have been quietly fermenting. The new capital is full of ambition and desire. They will not be willing to be ruled by the so-called “building nation” of the federation. If they have enough strength, they must Will give the most deadly counterattack, turn these families who have control of the lifeblood of life for a lifetime, and then slam them into the most soft places, tear them into pieces and become their own nutrients! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
