			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Harry’s trip to Otis did not take place, because Du Lin returned to Nano Lindes to continue to “repair”, he is still a wounded, naturally should not Run around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The journey from Leeds to Nam Lindes is not far away, and it is said that the earliest empire intends to place the capital of Phillips in Nam Lindes, but later Considering that Nano Lindes is a transportation hub, the economy has a unique advantage, but there is a lack of culture, so the empire will arrange the capital of Phillips in Leeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a not very reliable statement. It is said that the nobles and long princesses of Lizhua had a leg, so the capital was settled in Leeds, The aristocrats of this nano-Lindes almost went to war with the little white-faced aristocrat of Leeds. Of course, all this is already in the past, the truth is buried deep in history, no one will pursue this thing for the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry rushed from Leeds to Nam Lindes at 10 am, he carried some fruit and some pastries, and then let the unrelated people leave the ward He needs to talk to Du Lin alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There may be some misunderstandings between us that affect our friendship, but Doolin should understand that I have never hurt you, and I have asked for your request." Trying to satisfy as much as possible, including the fact that you want to set up the SAR, I have also made a lot of effort." Harry looked at Du Lin very sincerely. He must now speak before Du Lin knows the truth. Reflecting your honesty, "So I don't want other things to deepen our misunderstandings again. I can guarantee that everything I have done has never thought of harming you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was silent for a moment, as Harry had guessed, Du Lin still didn't know if Darcy said it was true. But from the moment Harry entered the ward, Du Lin understood that Darcy did not lie to himself. The people who can command the new party’s high-level officials to do the dirty work can count the two hands of the entire empire. More than half of them are closely related to Magus. It is impossible for Magus’s political ambition to do such a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there must be a leader in this matter. At first, he suspected that the person in charge of the deputy director of the police chief was a member of the Cape family. But now he knows, this person is Harry. He looked at Harry and shrugged his shoulders. He did not immediately say that he could understand Harry's "bitterness" and instead asked: "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of stability!", Harry said that he couldn't help but take out the cigarette case. He realized that it was a ward when he took out the cigarette and prepared it. He said that he was sorry and he threw the cigarette in his mouth on the floor. Stepped on two feet, but saw Doolin himself took out a cigarette. He smiled and took another cigarette and took a sip. "Why do we have so many advantages and supporters that we can't put the old party on the ground without giving them a chance to resist?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the sky outside the window and said: "Because those consortia, because of those capitalists, almost all members of the old party are composed of nobles of all sizes and those associated with the nobility. People are born with great advantages, that is, they have money. Plus they have a wealthy means of accumulating wealth on their own sites, so that the old party has abundant resources that can be allocated. They can maintain their camp without wavering, as long as they use money. There is a consortium that will enable the people they rule to have a decent job."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The consortium, capital power, is too important for us. Far from Say, say your city of Otis, if there are not so many construction sites and projects in progress, do you think your policy can be successfully implemented in the city of Otis?" He shook his head and snorted, "No, No, you want to get people The support must first give them what they want. It is precisely because a large number of capital forces invest in the city of Otis, so people get real benefits, they will support you who bring capital power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned around and spread his arms. "And everything I do is for stability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The sacred consortium led by the Cape family has great prestige in the north. The north is the region with the largest empire and the most financially rich areas. Perhaps you can see from the financial statements that the economic construction in the south is fast. In the north, what you see is only what you can see, and there are many things that you can't see. We need the support of the northern nobility. Only when they support us will they not support the old party."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know the Mennon?" Du Lin nodded. Harvey pointed at himself casually. "This is a very ambitious guy. He is almost like this election. Can take down the entire site of Anhuai, whether it is The party is still the old party, and he has to be taken away by him. Do you know why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin slightly indulged and asked: "Because of his society Is there a guarantee opportunity?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, it’s because of this. This businessman with a stench of horse dung is very clever and collaborates with all the local capitalists. A way of deceiving ordinary people only deceives the imperial citizens of the entire state, so he got control of the entire state with a 73% average vote! This is the power of capital and the future of the country. Trends, without the support of consortia and capital forces, it is very difficult to make a difference in politics. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of problems in the Mennons program, but this guy doesn't know where to find a good think tank, and has an idea for him - public bombing, typical. In many local newspapers, it is always reported from time to time who and who entered the hospital because of the accident, and they hang on the line because they are not going to give up their lives. At this time, the Kadima Party paid the high-priced medical expenses for these people and saved their lives. Or the children who are the children of the goddess of the lucky goddess, admitted to the university, the city hall for him to bring out all the expenses he needs to finish his college. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a constant emergence of such news in the public opinion of the local people in the continuous bombing, and finally people have discovered that these people are involved in the door farmers' society Protection plan. Under the guidance of these lucky people like benchmarks, people are more eager to let this kind of security system be fully popularized. Each month, 5 to 7 percent of the income can be exchanged for them. Protection, an insurance, a benefit, they have no reason to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the cooperation of local capital forces and consortia - the effort to contribute and the employees who confuse the people, the doormen’s emergence in the mid-term elections has taken over the control of the entire state. Right, he is now not only the leader of the Kadima Party, but also the governor. He has even publicly announced that he will run for the next prime minister. If he can be selected, he will popularize the social security system throughout the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, with the support of capital and the big consortium, he can realize what he promised, once he really became the prime minister, he attracted more capital. The idea has even attracted many capital forces to start to waver, which is very dangerous for the new party and the old party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many wise people have seen some fatal flaws in the plan of the Mennon. Once his promises are not fulfilled, the Kadima Party is destined to become the history of the Empire. stain. But why are you still supporting him? Because the doorman is the most suitable partner for the capital, he has left all the responsibilities, and the capitalists only need to put the funds in the society into their pockets from people's pockets and bank accounts. Just fine. Together with his social security plan, he can still make a fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once there is a problem, the capital does not need to come to the black pot, there is only one person in the black pot, that is, the doorman, and his Kadima party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the future, governance is no longer a person, but money!" Harry said with great certainty, "Without money, even if we have very good Political thinking is always just thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe you will receive a call soon, but I am coming, with my sincerity and apology, I need to apologize to you, because Darcy is arranged by me, and my purpose is to ease you and the north. The contradiction between the nobility consortium. I have already passed the phone with Mr. Cape. He asked me to apologize to him for him and is willing to compensate you for all the losses. At the same time, I personally said that this should not be said. It’s not the decision of anyone, but the private decision of the guy who was driven out of the office.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If you wish, he will be very harsh Punishment is enough to make you unable to see him in this life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurrying around for a big circle, Harry still wraps the subject back,<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin, everything in the past, whether it is good or bad, let it pass! We are together, our goals and interests are also the same, we should Join hands to fight against our true enemies, rather than creating barriers and conflicts "Harry really looked at Du Lin, and looked apologetic. "I apologize for my past attitude, I hope you can accept it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin face The expression on the face softened again. He smiled and took the initiative. "I don't want to see that guy again in my life. I don't accept your apology...", Harry's face suddenly appeared amazed expression. Du Lin quickly let him understand. "We are all wrong, not just you, as you said, we should understand each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Harry stepped forward and reached out and held tightly with Du Lin’s hand. “Yes, we should understand each other!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry said something again In line with the gossip of the atmosphere, and Du Lin must be getting better soon, the city of Otis can not be separated from him, and also stated that the cost of his hospitalization will be borne by the state government, which is a lot of the state government’s apologies for him. . Laughing as Harry walked away, the smile on Du Lin’s face suddenly cooled down, and he snorted and twisted his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I ate such a big loss, I want to let him "understand" long live? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's impossible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry’s visit also made Du Lin confirmed that this guy and Magus are definitely not a heart, he is just a stupid target, one thinks that he It is the target of the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
