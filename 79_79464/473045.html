			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wild rose has so many goods at a time, I think there may be problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gera The husband stood by Du Lin and said what he thought of in his heart. He checked it. The wine was delivered three days ago. That is to say, it took only three days, and fifty boxes of wine were sold out. ! This is too fast, right? Perhaps it is because of the huge profits brought by the sale of highly private wine, so that Graf, a big guy like a bear, has become nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Graf’s concerns, Doolin has his own opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it cannot be said that it sold fifty boxes of wine in three days. This is a mistake. Because any mature businessman can't wait for the goods to be sold out completely, I think I have to continue to stock up, so there should be some stock in the Wild Rose Bar. There is a secret in the business circle that is not secret. When the inventory drops to 30%, it means that it can be purchased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to say, there should be more than a dozen boxes of wine in the wild rose bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Graf also said that the wrong thing, fifty boxes of wine belong to two different categories, can only be regarded as each twenty-five Box, a total of fifty boxes. Sales are also different depending on the audience. If we say that each wine has sold more than a dozen boxes in three days, it is not an exaggeration, but it is not impossible. Each one has an average of 30 to 40 bottles per day. A bottle is calculated according to five cups, no more than two hundred cups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many guests are received in the Wild Rose Bar every day, he is not very clear, some guests can drink a little, some guests have a little drink, according to two cups per person, as long as there is Two hundred guests choose the wine they supply, and the wild rose bar's purchase demand is not a big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This data does have a bit of exaggeration, but it is not impossible. Because the bar sells loose wine to the guests on the spot, it also sells the whole bottle of wine for the guests to take home. If someone really likes first love and snow elves, buy one or two bottles to take home, or to hold a party party, it is not impossible to buy more bottles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thoughts, the sales volume of the wild rose bar is not exaggerated, there is nothing wrong with it, at most, the wild rose bar is well positioned in the guest The audience for both types of wine is very broad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After explaining this big man with muscles in his head, Du Lin asked Graf to arrange the delivery. Du Lin believes that with the new taste of the high-quality wine in the process of market sales gradually chemical reaction with the guests, the supply will only be greater in the future, then the purchase of the truck must also be on the agenda. Can't you tell the kids to run two boxes and send them? Even with a cart or a carriage, there is a risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought for a while and knocked on the bell at the corner of the table on the right side of the table. The crisp ringtone was very penetrating, and the office door opened immediately. It is. It took three days to simply decorate the first floor of No. 117, so that there is a lot of commercial atmosphere here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha opened the door and explored a brain, "boss?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin recruited and waved, and all Buddhas pushed in and came back to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wild rose bar has a hundred boxes of goods, Graf feels that there is a problem, I let him go, but can not ignore his views, maybe As he guessed, this delivery may be a trap.” Du Lin thought about it and sorted out the idea. “The things we did hit the original market and will definitely lead to the rebound of other tycoons. In the evening, bring a little person, bring a weapon to follow them, if there is anything unexpected, solve it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo is now the only team leader in the association. So, if Du Lin has a name, he can only point to him. He takes so much more money than others, has a higher status than others, and of course he should have more to pay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha nodded hard and said that he knew. Before he left, Doolin made a few more words. Be careful. Don't take the initiative when you have no choice. But once you get started, you must be clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin does not have his own network of contacts. In the city of Tener, there is almost a black eye. The only one who can rely on is the Kevin guy. . He once said that he would introduce some connections to Doolin, but it will take a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thinking about this, Du Lin’s eyes gradually sagged and fell into the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Camille Prosecutor initiated a public prosecution against Nasha, a girl from a foreign country. He said there is strong evidence to prove that people are called 'leather pants'. Reese died of premeditated murder. This case has drawn attention from all walks of life in the city. After hearing this incident, Kevin, the future star of the lawyers, expressed strong indignation against Camille and the city court. Pointing out that Camille sued Nasha, the real reason is that he needs a successful lawsuit that can sensationalize the Empire and help him climb to the position of the state prosecutor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"For Camille, he violated professional ethics and facts and caused a second injury to girl Nasha. Kevin lawyer said that he was very angry. He has applied to the city court and will become a lawyer for Nasha. Get her back Kamil owes her justice and justice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the public notice of the city court, this Saturday at 9:20 am, will be City Court No. 3, the case is tried. If you want to watch the process of this trial, please arrive at Court No. 3 before 9:15..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Du Lin mouth a hook, this is Kevin's plan, they created a loophole in the scene, the purpose is to lead the prosecutor Camille, and then Kevin will step on him. In the legal profession, prosecutors are the enemies of lawyers' lives. They will question any opinions and evidence without any reason, and find ways to find the fatal flaws from the evidence and confessions submitted by lawyers and characterize the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Kevin has signed a contract with Weiner Law Firm, one of the three major law firms in the capital, he must be doing a beautiful job before he leaves. The case as his own answer sheet. For the capital lawyers who have already been above the top, let them know that even if Kevin is from a small city, these so-called barristers can not be underestimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is more suitable than this case, and there is no hope at all. Every piece of evidence points to the girl named Nasha who murdered Mo with others. The case of Rees turned over completely. Not only did he have a great chance to promote the state prosecutor’s Camille, but he was also able to gain support from society and public opinion, temporarily letting people forget his past work for the devil, which is his meticulous work for himself. A gift prepared by Dooling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once he flipped such a case, he gained respect in the high society of the city of Tener. The more magnificent the building, the more likely it is to hide it in an unknown corner. Are the glamorous tycoons really clean from top to bottom? No, no one is clean, so they also want to have a lawyer who is "all-powerful". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the support of public opinion, the support of the industry, and the support of the upper class, Kevin has the key to the peak of the business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he introduced Doolin to others, whether or not to maintain Kevin’s face, they would accept Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
