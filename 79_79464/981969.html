			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood up and walked to the girl's side, and he could clearly see that the girl's body was shaking violently. The gunshots that just sounded outside the house told the girl very clearly. Her brother, sister, and two mothers, maybe... No, they are definitely dead. She would like to accuse Du Lin of this swindler who is full of lies, actually making a speech that is not such a thing, but fear can dominate the girl's whole, so that she can not even breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin touched the girl’s supple hair. At the moment when his palm touched the girl’s hair, he felt the girl’s body suddenly shaken sharply. And then stabilized. The scalp under the hair is tightly stretched, and the girl has made great efforts to control her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't lie...", the girl's horrified eyes glanced at Doolin's eyes and looked away. Du Lin took back her hand and continued. Said: "I gave them the most complete freedom, let their souls free themselves from their own bodies, return to the embrace of God, get the perfect state. You should not be sad, you should bless them. Lost If you don't get strong protection from money and status, you will soon become the target of those 'predators'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have been Something else that others have done will be given back to you and tortured and humiliated you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said, am I doing the right thing?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl lowered her head and her body trembled slightly to make her look like a thunderstorm in the wilderness, and she spit out for a while. A syllable, "Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin laughed, "Look, look Make it clear that all misunderstandings will disappear. You have some use. If you do it well enough, you may suffer from this filthy and dirty world for a while! Good luck, girl!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the lawyer, and after he nodded, he left the room and the next lawyer would help him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true content of these documents is mostly the first heir, that is, Andorra’s original wife is willing to give up inheritance, and the youngest girl inherits all the property in the family. But because the girl is not yet 20 years old and has no adulthood, the property was temporarily handed over to a foundation called "Western Light" that Du Lin had just set up to manage the operation. One percent of all proceeds would be In cash, the girl is paid monthly for living expenses, and the rest will be returned after the girl’s 20th birthday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federer’s lawyer told Du Lin that if Andorra’s wife or his adult child signed a free transfer agreement and other exchanges and transaction agreements, it would have to go through the justice department and the imperial chamber of commerce, and both parties – - That is, the successor of Andorra and Du Lin went to the Chamber of Commerce to change the ownership of the branch in the west. There is a high probability of some uncontrollable possibilities in this process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Andorra’s family is very selfish, he ran off halfway, or shouted for help in some judicial departments and chambers of commerce, Du Lin It is impossible to kill them in public in front of many people. Killing people in the wild is completely different from the nature and concept of killing in cities and even in those functional organs. As far as the current law of the empire is concerned, eyewitnesses are enough to make a large number of changes in a case. So many witnesses, Du Lin, are absolutely subject to trial or even jail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safest way is to use a third party to take over the property, and then arrange a shackle that can be controlled for the time being, which is also the current big family of the empire. A way to use with big consortia. They need to control their own heirs' desire for consumption, and then give them a bright future, and further let them limit their behavior and urge themselves to advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big family did this in order to nurture and give a decent future to future generations without inheritance rights. Federer’s lawyer suggested that Du Lin did this, on the one hand Living in some people's mouths proves that Du Lin will not kill them. On the other hand, he takes care of the judicial system and the face of the Western rules, so that Du Lin's eating is not so ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is acting according to the rules, and there is nothing to say in this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is for you, you can’t grasp the property that you’ve been robbed, it’s just that you’re incompetent—no one will evaluate the girl’s and Doolin’s Force and energy, all they need is a beginning, process and ending they don't care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, most decent people are so hypocritical, they need someone else’s respect for them, and if those people are cursing them when they are greeting, Do you want to slap him when he turns around? That is the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the future, let's talk about it later! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andorra’s death has caused some mine owners to be wary of Doolin, even though Mr. Jack explained the reasons for the clients he introduced to Doolin. The customer also said that he suddenly did not want to sell the mine. He felt that he was suitable for death in the west in his life. Kaishan is their favorite, and mining makes them happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sell ​​your own happiness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, I can't do it, this is not a question of money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm of things was quickly overshadowed by another news, exactly two. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the western world, a huge storage of bauxite was discovered on the Yagur Mountains. The mining of bauxite is comparable to iron ore and silver. The mining of gold mines is much simpler. Experts in the field of empire geology are as excited as collective narcotics. Some experts claim that Yagur is the most abundant mineral resource on the planet. They even found a lot of evidence from some records in history. The handwritten notes from the origins made their arguments seem really reliable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Age of History once had a very brilliant civilization. The modern industrial and scientific foundations are based on some civilizations left over from the origins, so why is it awkward? Will civilization be destroyed? There are some handbooks of the origins that record some of the reasons that may have caused the destruction of the origin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two kinds of arguments, the ground crack and the sky crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a continent in which all continents, including the distant East, were once a whole, but with an unprecedented crustal movement, a super volcanic eruption The huge energy splits the entire land floor into a number of blocks. As the pressure inside the earth's crust finds a catharsis point, the huge planet energy pushes all the land to the super volcano as a dot, constantly moving to the outside, forming the present world. Terrain opera. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, geologists believe that the Yakul Mountains, a weathered mountain that has never been valued by people in the past, may be part of the super volcano at the time, a large number of The lava is ejected with abundant matter, and after many years of accumulation and sedimentation, it has formed a huge group of veins in the Yagur Mountains, and is rich in variety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement is currently the most mainstream statement on the market, and most people think that this statement is closest to the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bit of a fantasy in the sky, and the origin of this statement comes from the handwritten musical notes of some of the origins, which claim to be the Dragon King. In order to achieve immortality, the souls of all species in the entire empire were extracted, in exchange for their chance to be immortal. After his success, the god of the origins felt the evil from here, so he lowered a meteorite that destroyed the world, destroyed all the civilizations of the whole world, and everything was reset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
