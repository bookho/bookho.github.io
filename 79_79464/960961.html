			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the owner of the bar came in, he saw the tension of Zhang Jian, and the heart almost came out of his throat. After swallowing a sip, I thought that this bar could not only make a lot of money for him, but also had another important role. Finally, he held his hands on his scalp and slowly moved forward. "Du Lin Sir, I am the boss here, don't be angry...", he slowly walked to the place where Doolin could see him, and he was relieved to see that Dulin did not make any further moves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also knows Madur, after all, everyone is engaged in the "entertainment" industry, and some blame a look at Madur, the original hard-hearted horse. Dürr was so glanced at the bar owner, suddenly a bit inexplicable, and at the same time sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always thought that Doolin did not dare to kill him. His conviction was that this young man should be very aware of the cost of killing. This is not a premeditated plan. The murder was a murder that was unscrupulous and evasive in public. It was full of witnesses. He could not escape the arrest of the police and the investigation bureau. As for why he is so sure, in fact, from Freina's move, it can be seen that this strange Mr. Du Lin is not good enough, and he must be a bit tolerant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who have patience, such as him, think a lot when thinking about things, thinking is a good thing, it makes people sensible, it also makes people Lose courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bar owner’s move made him realize that Mr. Doolin might be a big man and he found out that he had done something stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big guys and the little guys are totally different in the face of this situation, because the big guys bear less responsibility and have less consequences, which is also It is said that Du Lin is really likely to kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, Madur’s stomach was a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not alive and tired, really wants to die, purely wants to give each other a kind of "I am not afraid of fear, you can kill me, but you also To pay the same price, such feelings, let the other side take the initiative to hesitate, or even take a step back. When the other side takes a step back, he can go further. How to deal with this matter is really hard to say. These people in the emperor are sometimes so unreasonable, so decisive and tough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at the bar owner, and the agent went to him and whispered a few words. He said "turn the light on." The bar owner immediately opened the lights of this private room. When the warm yellow light was in the whole room, Madur really saw all the "views" in the room, and also saw the two behind Du Lin. Individuals, agents, and branch members of the association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurately, these two people know that the agents in the Imperial City account for 40% of the market share of 50%, as Madur, who often needs social interaction, must know. Perhaps the relationship between them is not so familiar, but also a few words, especially what activities need to be held, when the wine is used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to occupy such a large market share of the Emperor, in addition to the quality of the private wine in hand, but also in this group of bastards dare to fight, all tough confrontation After some inexplicable visits to God, no one or force can incite their position in the capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other one knows more. The fellowship has developed into a large gang with religious nature and a large number of people in the eyes of some people. They are spread over more than 70 cities in the empire, and the total number has exceeded 410,000. This is the data registered by the Imperial Civil Society Administration. So there are some people who are not registered? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, the fellowship has made many people from disdain to surprise to fear, and behind them are standing alone. A man named Doolin, who is even more joking, is the Mr. Doolin or an imperial official, the mayor of Otis! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked directly at Madur and grinned. "I don't like to talk to people with my head up."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being killed by a young man named Turin or Du Li, young people may be brutally retaliated, but killed by a young mayor named Du Lin, dead It is also white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original canned box that can be kicked off on the roadside, I didn’t expect it to be a solid steel nail. The consequences of kicking this foot are too serious. Now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madur slightly bent over and sat on the coffee table, and his move made Du Lin somewhat surprised. Madur looked at Doolin and grinned and said, "You won, I am willing to pay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is certainly not the best choice, but Madur can only think of this solution to solve the current dilemma. Of course, he also played a small slick, he did not kneel or kneel, chose to sit on the table. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thinks this guy is very interesting. The bar owner whispered to Du Lin about the things about Madur. It’s a little unexpected for Du Lin. Dürr's popularity is actually quite good. At least he is very protective of his own craftsman, and for this reason he has resisted some big people, although it is very bad at the end. In fact, he also understands that the purpose of the bar owner is to let Dooling not to kill Madur, at least not to kill Madur in his bar, and Doolin has new ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science Island - This is his name for the research base. More than two million additional funds have been passed down. Those fucking scientists have solved the signal during transmission. The problem of attenuation, the research of signal decoding has also been promoted to a considerable extent, and he still has a great contribution to this. After all, he said a few words with a flash of light, so that Stan loves a new kind of idea with the help of this genius. Conception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, cable TV may have a breakthrough in a year or two, and at that time it only takes a few hundred pieces, so that it can only be played. The tape TV sets a new picture through a line, and the effect created is absolutely extraordinary, but it is a unique business! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a considerable degree of demand for the structure of the content, and it is not possible to spend hundreds of access lines and spend a certain amount of money each month. But can only watch for a few days? Originally, Du Lin’s plan was to transform the performance school into a “performance factory.” The appearance of Madur allowed him to see another road and annex it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the most important way for capital forces to go. The operation of capital has never been so painstakingly started from scratch, all through the way of hurting people. Constantly expand your own volume to achieve your own goals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin turned his wrist and took the pistol back into his pocket. He went to the sofa and sat down, pointing to the position next to him. Madur rubbed his cold sweat on his head and sat down. Du Lin’s next words almost made him pick up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I always believe in a truth, everyone has to pay for their actions, do you agree with this view?", Du Lin said Madur He nodded, he thought, and asked for money, he gave it, Du Lin said: "You want to buy a strong friend and sign my friend, it doesn't matter, I solved it, then now we follow you The script is repeated again, 100,000, I bought your company!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can call to find someone who you think can scare me to scare me. If I am scared, then this is the end. If you find someone who can't scare me, I am very sorry, then next I have the final say." Du Lin took out a cigarette in the cigarette case, tilted his leg and tipped his toes. "You can call.", said Du Lin looked at the bar owner. "Trouble you to find a lawyer, I don't have much time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barkeeper who is able to "peace" the conflict is already very satisfied, he Nodded and turned and left, ran to the office to call his lawyer, let him come over immediately. As for the fee, it is settled twice as usual. Lawyers who have a great passion for their work promised that they will arrive at the bar as quickly as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private room, Madur’s voice was a little hoarse, and Du Lin’s words would take away his dreams over the years and the ladder to heaven, but he could not do anything. He also felt a kind of funny that couldn't be said. He also did this to others in the previous second. In the next second, he also tasted the pain. "Can't you change the choice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Change?" Du Lin smiled and nodded. "Add one more option. You commit suicide here. I will take care of your family and your company. Can you choose now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not Madur’s use of a small trick, but other means... If it’s not Du Lin’s entry into the room, he still has some restraint, if not the contract on the coffee table. The content is "fair" than imagined, and Du Lin will not give him this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madur knows that he doesn’t make sense to say anything. When he gets up and goes to the private room, he needs to contact his partner. After all, this company is nominally It is a multi-person holding, he has to see if these friends have the means to help him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first called the friend who had a better relationship with him. The other party is a nobleman. He is currently running a family business, and his power is not small. Because it is a nobleman in the south, it is also called a new force. It is said that it is very good in the South, and many people sell his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Madur made this thing clear, the phone was silent for a moment, and the familiar voice was heard. "I don’t want money, tomorrow I I will ask my lawyer to send you an agreement that I will take the initiative to unconditionally give up the equity and transfer it to you. It will take effect without your signature.", and it was a short silence. "There is a chance to go to the federal side." Look, there are still many good opportunities there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
