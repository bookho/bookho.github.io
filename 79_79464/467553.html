			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Doolin brought the wine from the supplier, he only gave a deposit of one tenth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bars did not give the full amount, but according to the rules that Du Lin commissioned Graf, at least 30% of the deposit was paid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't worry about anyone who dares to pay, unless they don't want to sell these unusually high wines in the future. If they retire, Du Lin has a way to bring the money back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital is never a bright, not only ugly exploitation and oppression, but also bloody competition and repression. Competition can be civilized or barbaric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the girl’s lips trembled and said the day’s income figures, Graf licked her chest, and all the cigarettes that had just been in the hands of the Buddha fell. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the ones and the tens of decimals, 19,600. For this figure, Du Lin is still very satisfied, although the difference of 400 can break through the 20,000 mark, but this is already very amazing sales performance, and this is still a 30% deposit. Once the shipment is completed, it will be able to get back almost 66,000 yuan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This step is going out, the future can be expected! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Graf asked while holding his chest: "Dulin, is it... Does it mean that I can get thousands of pieces?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at him and looked at the Buddha. "Explain to this idiot and tell him how much he can get." The money certainly cannot be counted. It is a net profit, except for the cost and all necessary expenses and reserves, the net profit is about 15,000 yuan. Graf is 40%, which is 6,000 yuan, and the rest are Doolin's own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Dulin doesn’t plan to distribute it in the way he is in the present way. It’s not that he sees forgiveness, he feels that Graf is so uncomfortable, he doesn’t want it. Greed the money in the hands of Tugraf. A company, a company, and a small community want to thrive in healthy growth, development, and interests can never be concentrated in the hands of two people. It is necessary to let this part of the benefits go out and let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a saying that he feels right. In the dream, Daxie once communicated with the boss of a people's livelihood brand enterprise. The words that the boss said made Du Lin remember in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is very simple. To Dolin’s understanding is that if you want to get more, you will inevitably hurt those who do not have the risk of resistance and be forced to leave. . Doing business, doing community, doing everything well, all need people, and people's help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that no one can't do anything, but that no one can do nothing, so there is a wealth of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Du Lin wants to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get some dividend rights from Graf, and also take part of the dividend right here, and then let the money out, whether it is buying people's hearts, Still getting through the joints is far more meaningful than Du Linyi in his own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This society is like a huge net. You and me walking on the Internet, if you can't be a hunter, you can only become a prey. Being swallowed is not the wish of Doolin, so he wants to net, actively tie the net, and build a vast network! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all the money was in an iron box, Doolin stuffed the key into his pocket. He handed out a roll of cash, which was two small denominations of cash. I ordered twenty shots, let Dudu give the girls away, and then patted Graf, who had not returned to the soul, and turned to the other room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin closed the door with ease, the room had not had time to decorate, only a few ragged chairs, full of dust. He walked over to the window and took out a cigarette and handed it to Graff, a happy smile. He turned his hands and pressed it against the window sill, looking at the cars and pedestrians on the road. It seems that I noticed that Doolin had something to say, and Graf came over. He was facing the street and half sitting on the window sill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You look around." Du Lin raised his finger at the surrounding buildings, and Graf turned his eyes and turned, as Du Lin pointed The direction of the past is over. Although you can only see the buildings on both sides of the street and the people on the streets, it has already begun to prosper. Du Lin took back his arm and took a sip of smoke. While shaking his head, he sighed. "This is the country!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months ago, Du Lin had not thought about it. In his cognition, this is a big city and a bustling place. But now take a closer look, here is the country, the country to the place where you can no longer be in the country. The deserted streets, low buildings, slow pace of life are especially suitable for the elderly, but definitely not suitable for struggle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know big cities? Real big cities, capitals, capitals, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Graf thought for a moment, "I know, but I have never been there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin twisted his head and looked at him very seriously. "Want to go?" Go to the big city to have a look, look at the scenery there and see how the streets there are different from the streets here. I heard that there is a 38-story steel building in the capital, if you stand in that building. On the top of the building, will you see a different view of Peace Day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Travel?", Graf’s face raised a thick smile, generally speaking There is another word for this kind of thick smile, the laughter of a fool. He scratched his head and had a hint of hope in his eyes. "Yes, I always want to go to those places to play, but unfortunately I have no money before. Now I have a long time to see if I have money. Where are you going? Go A few days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin flew the cigarette butt, and he smiled twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tour?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is conquering!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin said these words, Graf suddenly felt the blood in the body rushing Up, an inexplicable force emerged from all parts of the body, filling his body. His face rose red, waving two arms with a girl's waist, trying to hit something, but nowhere to vent. His nostrils became round and he snorted while breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know what he is, there is an inexplicable impulse in his heart, but there is no clue. His instinct tells him that this is the most important moment in his life, just as he paid for forty dollars for six thousand. The last time he seized the opportunity, but this time I saw the opportunity, but I didn’t know why I couldn’t catch it. It felt like the essence of life was about to erupt, but it always felt a little worse, but I couldn’t reach it. a feeling of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painful, awkward, confused! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes life is such a caodan, you see it, but it doesn't belong to you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have an idea, I will give out 9 percent of the dividends as a reward mechanism, a means to strengthen our strength. If If you like, you can also take some of it and do it together. Of course, this is not forced, so you understand that it is like an early investment." Du Lin said what he wanted to say at this pass, Gera The husband was also attracted by this sentence, ignoring the kind of thing that made him unaware of how to vent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment, then tried to say: "How about I take out 5 percent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that Du Lin would refuse, because Du Lin took out 9%, and he only took out 5 percent. But he also had his own ideas. Originally, he took 10% less than Du Lin. If he also took out 9% or 10%, he would lose another 10%. If it was yesterday, Du Lin said that he would not hesitate to take 10% or more, because at that time he did not understand how 10% is a concrete concept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, he understands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10%, maybe three or five thousand, or maybe three or five thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very ok to take out 5 percent of his character. A man who has only saved forty yuan in his lifetime can take out the right to pay dividends that are limited to seven or eight hundred. It is very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin had no objections, no refusal, and did not confuse him to take more. He just nodded and said a good one. This thing seems to be fixed. Come down. Doolin let Graf go to work and let him call the Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the short time that Dufo has not come in, Du Lin’s heart is actually very disappointing. He hopes that Graf can show a temperament, a temperament with leadership and aggressiveness. But unfortunately, this guy is not as strong as his appearance. He is like a very ordinary person, dare to gamble when he is poor and there is nothing to lose. But once you have it, you will shrink your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
