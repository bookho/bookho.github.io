			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya lie on the bed and turn around, she rarely rests so early, because of the work, the night is the most active time, often accompanying customers to socialize Or, find a bar for fun with colleagues. Most of the time I go home is 11 or 2 pm, or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t sleep, she felt like she was going crazy, and Du Lin was crazy, and she spent so much money to help her find her back. Once she was young, there was a time of youthful youth. Those who wore fashionable clothes and looked at the cigarettes were almost the collective memories of that generation. They also did similar things because of a few blowjobs. It’s so troublesome, maybe I thought it was youth, but now I think it’s naive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is doing the same thing, but he can't find a childish feeling at all, but it is very majestic and very overbearing! It was a billion-dollar star. When I thought of this huge and innumerable number of Natiya, I used my quilt to cover my head, and I was a little bit sullen and went back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some knight novels, this kind of story often appears. The big aristocrats spend a lot of money for Cinderella. She thought that literature is always art, but it ignores art. Life, it turns out that there really is such a thing, there are such people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inevitably, the mood is ups and downs, and I will think of Du Lin’s slap in the face of Alan Duy, and I will think of Du Linhao’s throwing 100 million stars. To find your face for yourself, the heartbeat is getting faster and faster, and there is a feeling that you can't say it. I don't know what it feels like, it's sour, bitter and spicy, but there is only one feeling that I can get her affirmation, that is, a sense of security. I have never felt safe like it is now, even if she was a senior partner of South Commercial Bank, she did not feel safe like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mess in my mind is constantly rolling like a dark cloud, is it a silver snake that is now dispelling sleepiness, there is only a slight breath in the quiet room, and A pair of bright eyes. At this moment, the sudden knock on the door made her suddenly stunned. "Who is outside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Natiya, Mr. Doolin asks you Put on clothes and go to the hall, there are guests to visit.", outside the door is the voice of the butler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has bought the manor on the federal side for almost four years, when he first came to live, but here in four years Everything is maintained with the necessary expenses, a variety of clothing accessories and the like, including a complete set of service personnel. All the staff in the manor cherish the job very much. There is a lord who is almost nowhere to live. It is much more comfortable than the lord at home every day. More often, the housekeeper is the owner of the manor. When the owner is absent, he will be Come and give orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the first time that the butler is grateful for the identity of his gult. If he does not have this identity, he will not be the stewards here, so he is grateful to Du Lin for all the "owners". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will leave now, leaving two maids to help you change clothes.", the farther footsteps gradually disappeared, and Natiya turned on the lights. A set of casual clothes, she is not too adapted to such a life, more like a noble life. The life of the nobility is actually very fucking. It is not necessary to wear formal attire every moment. There are a lot of things to wear in any occasion. What kind of clothes are worn in the private area of ​​the owner, what clothes to wear in the living room, what to wear in the garden. The clothes are different and all are stressful. If ordinary people do not have the habit of growing up from childhood, it is difficult to adapt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two maids led the Natiya into the cloakroom after opening the door, and provided her with the best dress for the evening reception, tossing After more than twenty minutes, she changed her clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she walked into the eclipse, she saw Alan Duy and two people around him at a glance. She smiled and nodded, then saw Du Lin patted the sofa around her, and she walked over to sit around Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin turned her head and smiled at her. "Mr. Alan Duy has understood his recklessness and rashness. He was condemned by his conscience and couldn’t wait to think. I want to apologize to you." This sentence made Natiya almost unable to stand up and laughed. If she didn't know what happened, she might feel surprised. Maybe she might really think that Mr. Alain Duy is really I know that I am wrong. But she knew what Du Lin had done, and after listening to Du Lin’s words, she had an inexplicable mood to laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real big guys, are they used to squinting and talking? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Dooling, and Du Lin slightly tilted her head. "When you didn't come, Mr. Alan Duy regretted his rude behavior. Very sincere, I think Mr. Alan Duy’s nature is not bad, but sometimes the temper is a little worse, the temper is also very direct, I don’t know how to express myself.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Alan Duy nodded, and his face was full of apologies. "Yes, Mr. Doolin is right. I apologize for my stupidity and rude behavior. Madam, I accidentally hurt you. I have been suffering from my heart. Today I have the courage to apologize to you. I hope that I can get your understanding.", he said that he took out a set from his handbag and glared in the light. Gemstone Kit - a gemstone necklace, a gemstone bracelet, a gemstone ring and a pair of gemstone earrings sparkling, gorgeous reflections of intoxicating luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gift is too expensive, Natiya simply estimated that if it is in the empire, this set of jewelry must be at least three to 50,000. She noticed that there was a small bronzing signature at the bottom of the red velvet pad, which should be the work of the master, and the price might be higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not immediately quit, but instead looked at Doolin, she was not sure if she should accept it. Dooling nodded and said, "You should forgive Mr. Alan Duy. He has already realized his mistake. The gods will forgive the sinners who regret it. We can't think that he is always wrong because he did it wrong. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya smiled and took the jewelry box over and looked at it carefully. "I like it very much, as Mr. Doolin said. Everyone makes mistakes, as long as they realize their mistakes, even if it is a stupid mistake, it deserves to be forgiven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan Duy has a hint of no Controlled twitching, but now the situation is not good, he has no second way to go, but he certainly hears that these two people have been scorning him stupidly, and he is also mocking that he is sitting opposite them, but also Bow down and apologize, but he has no second way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once your own shipping business is shaken, people are found to be empty, the royal family will definitely let him surprise in the first time, whether for himself or for the family. He must all converge. He also realized that sometimes money can't solve any problem. In Farolan, he is the richest and most powerful person, but at the international level, he is only a landlord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he found Mr. Jack to help him, Mr. Jack told him that if Doolin did not let go, they would not have any further moves, only Can wish him good luck. Philips also said something similar. This is a person who even dared to fight with Mr. Kaile’s son. Even Kaile Hotel dared to swear, and Mr. Kaile took the initiative to apologize. He was even more uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional to Dulin’s ability to mobilize the energy and wrists of the official navy, Alain Dui’s recognition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good now looks good, both are willing to forgive him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Du Lin said with a smile, "Mr. Alan Duy, you have said less, the most sincere three words (words)."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
