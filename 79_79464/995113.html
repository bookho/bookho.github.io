			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must feel that I am provoking the relationship between you and Clilan.", Sandra took a napkin and dipped the sauce on her lips. I also stretched out the tip of the pink tongue. "Yes, I just did it. Jindis and Orvili have always been in a competitive relationship in the west. The better he does, the worse I do." Can make him more troubles for me to ease my business burden. And I believe...", she suddenly laughed softly, and the surrounding environment seemed to be a lot more vivid because she laughed. "He I don't want to be friends with you, and you don't want to be friends with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still half a hump on the plate in front of Du Lin, camel Things are rare in the Yaoxing Empire. Although there are some desertified areas, it is far from reaching the level of camels and there is no environment for camels to grow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These camels are imported from the Arland empire, the main purpose is "food", the hump is the best part of the camel. The rich layers of fat and muscle fibers are intertwined, and the taste of the best frosted beef is more delicate, and there is some flavor that beef does not have. Marinate with some spices before baking, then wrap it in honey to lock the flavor of the spices in the flesh. After 18 hours of refrigerating, take it out and bake it, then pour the secret sauce to give a very unique taste and taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if these meats are all living, the moment in the entrance can feel the most blooming of life in this moment, this is definitely a wonderful Enjoyment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a roasted hump, the price is 68 pieces, with other side dishes and the red wine and the surrounding "ambience" The price of the meal will not be less than four hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the life of a rich man, a life that poverty can never imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin tilted his leg and licked a cigarette. He leaned slightly at Sandra, and he shrugged. "Maybe I He will be a good friend, maybe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra did not care with a smile and retorted: "No, you won't. Because you won The first copper mine discovered this year is definitely a very fatal blow to him. The Jindis Metal Mining Group is the second largest metal mining company in the empire, and all the second-ranked people will always look In the first, even more than the first place, the same is true for Kings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You got this copper mine, which means that Jindis lost a copper mine, which means that there will be tens of thousands of tons of copper ingots on the market, meaning that the market prices will fluctuate significantly. The only way is to use more money to buy the copper ingots in your hands and make sure you continue to have absolute control over the copper classifications associated with non-ferrous metals. You let them lose more and they will transfer this responsibility to Clarianf’s body, because his 'incompetence' caused the company to lose a lot of money, he would regard this result as the damage you caused him.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Now, do you still think that you will be friends?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra’s words are not wrong at all, the mall is like a battlefield, there is nothing Human feelings can be said, especially in a society where there is no effective constraint on capital expansion, it is a mainstream view to regard economic achievements as the value of a person in society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People say to those who have failed, you should go where you should go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is thrown into the trash, like no value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of Dooling makes Cleveland "price down", he will definitely attribute all the reasons to Du Lin, they will never be able to do Friends, and they will soon become enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra has already reminded him, and Du Lin also noticed Sandra’s reminder that he frowned slightly and quickly stretched out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So can we be friends?" Du Lin asked, "According to your statement, there is also a direct competitive relationship between us. When I have the right time, I will continue to shoot. Will this make us an enemy?" He grinned with a grin. "It is my pleasure to have a beautiful enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra was teased and laughed by Doolin. "Are you changing the way to praise my beauty? Well, I accepted your compliments!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his toast, the two took a sip, and the violinist pulled the strings faster, gradually covering up the conversation between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that we will become enemies?", Sandra put down the glass, "No, no. The goal of the Orvili Group is not entirely on non-ferrous metals, which is related to the future strategic plan of the group company, so I can't tell you too much. I can only say that we won't be enemies, but there is a great chance that we will become friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra refused after dinner Du Lin sent her back to the courtesy proposal to leave alone, and Du Lin quickly took his eyes back from his back. Sandra has revealed a lot of news to him. He feels that the biggest gain today is not that he got a copper mine, but the meal. He didn't quite know what Sandra was deliberately showing, but no matter what purpose she was holding, she could not escape the scope of interest. If there is no interest in Doolin's body, Sandra may not have dinner with him and say so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things are found out, guessed, and a general situation in the west, Du Lin is even mastered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, Doolin made people busy with the mining license of the copper mine. In fact, after the privatization of the land, the owner of the land, even if The owner opened a hole in the ground that was directly connected to the earth, and it had nothing to do with the empire. The full name of this license is called “Environmental Protection License for Mining Non-Ferrous Metal Resources”, and it is necessary to pay a fee as compensation for possible damage to the environment and to repair the environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, it’s the way the three western states have come out to make money. Here is the Gobi, or the kind of canyon that has weathered for many years. Where does it come from? "Beautiful environment"? To this end, Du Lin needs to pay a deposit of 15,000 yuan to get the license, and then to carry out large-scale mining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very simple little thing, anyone can do it, but in this impossible event, a little bit Accident, the license can't be done! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have said why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aellis scratched his head, "responsible The state government official of this incident told me that it is about to start the spring soon, because this year's agricultural and livestock land has risen sharply, so the permit needs to be postponed, and can only be applied after the end of farming..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin listened to the stunned moment, followed by a sigh of laughter. "Take a thousand yuan of denomination in the past and tell him that we have invested in this copper mine." A lot of money can't wait so long to see if there is any simpler way to get around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ellis said that Du Lin knew that this was not a legitimate excuse, it was purely for the benefit, or that he wanted to be embarrassed. This style is very common, especially in some departmental departments of the city hall. It is natural to have a large amount of facilitation fees to send the work, which is much more than the honest work. . At the level of the state government, there will be special people to do this work, they are called hackers, and the elegance can be called a lobbyist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Du Lin did not intend to borrow someone else’s hand, a humble clerical staff, a thousand enough to send. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t really pay attention to it until Ellis returned with a thousand pieces to make Du Lin realize that someone was targeting himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I looked at Ellis’s wrongdoing, Du Lin did not say that he was sitting in the chair opposite him. What did he say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guy said that this is not a question of money, it is a matter of policy. The new mining will produce a lot of industrial sewage and garbage. It will affect the underground water source within a few kilometers in the vicinity. These things have a great impact on the ecological environment and may cause abnormal cultivation in some areas. Let us wait until mid-April, when all the seeds are germinated. Only then can I apply for a permit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement has absolutely no problem, the mining itself is digging down, it is easy to dig into the main stream of some underground rivers And the various sewages will cause great damage to the water quality. But the problem is that it is the west, the west is full of people, and the copper mine is more than 100 kilometers away from the nearest city. If it really pollutes the groundwater, there is more than 100 kilometers of natural filtration. There is no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no excessive chemical pollution in the open copper mine. It is nothing more than some sewage with excessive metal content. These metal powders are also in the flow of underground rivers of more than 100 kilometers. It’s settled, and there are so many things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded undecidedly. "This is not to blame you, and others are interfering in our business. I will personally ask."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he asked Ellis to continue doing things, then made a call to the secretary of the state governor’s secretary and found the person in charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
