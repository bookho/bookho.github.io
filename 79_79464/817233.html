			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp thought about this problem while wandering around the store where he sold luxury goods in the city. When he found the third house, he finally saw it in the counter. A similar lighter. He smiled and handed the lighter to the teller. "I got a lighter from the roadside. I think its owner should be very anxious. I don't know if you can return this lighter to its owner?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teller checked the lighter that Anpu handed over and gave Amp a positive reply. "Thank you very much, you are an honest person. I believe that the owner will know very much afterwards." Happy. Do you need to leave a contact method? Perhaps the owner will thank you in person." Such a lighter sold for more than two hundred pieces here, it is already a lavish luxury, maybe the owner will give a little reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking for the owner may be more difficult for someone who has found this thing, but it is much simpler for the business. Every luxury item has its own unique number. At the moment of selling, they will retain at least one contact method for the buyer to carry out the normal after-sales service. Just look up the number under the lighter and you can find the owner of the lighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Amp declined the teller’s request, he waved his hand and left the store. At the moment he left, he ran and rushed to Erie. Ann's telegraph office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gasped and showed his credentials, and then made a request, "I want to monitor a number, is there a problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The telegraph office gave the police station a call and then let Amp enter the house where the wiring machine was installed. At this time, the phone could not be "smart". The automatic connection must be done manually. When a light is on, the dialing information of the line is answered, and then the two terminals are connected according to the dialing information, and the wiring work is completed. If it is a long distance, it will be more troublesome. It may take three or even four operators to dial the number in the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp said the name of the luxury store, the operator quickly found the registered line. After waiting for about five minutes, the line lights up. The operator glanced at Amp, and Amp snorted and did as usual. The operator answered the message and then docked another line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you can monitor it." The operator inserted the plug of the headset into an empty slot and Amp sat in his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t wait long, he heard the sounds on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, here is the Sea Cliff Doolin Manor, I am Dove..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Hello, Ms. Dove, I have a registrant named Mr. Doolin's lost property. Is Mr. Doolin there? If he is convenient, he can pick up his lost lighter. If he is not convenient, we also You can send the lost property to your side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sorry, Mr. Doolin went to the field, if you can, please send it over." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp frowned and returned the headset to the operator He thought it would be Du Lin's phone call, but he didn't expect Du Lin to leave Irian. Where did he go? Is it sinful to escape? Still doing something else? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left as a thinker, subconsciously touched his pocket and took the cigarette case out. When the cigarette case was opened and a cigarette was taken out, it was found that the smoke had been exhausted. When he was just about to throw away the box, the whole person stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cigarette case! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the cigarette case, the crime scene has a lot of cigarette butts, and the chemical test on Juan’s tongue also proves that he smoked before dying. A lot of tobacco, then where is the cigarette case? The cigarette case doesn't look big, but in the absence of any direct evidence, Amp has to take all the problems into consideration, and the lighter has it, so what about the cigarette case? If the lighter is Doolin, then will the cigarette be provided by Dooling? Amp immediately thought of Ghost Mushroom, this horrible toxic fungus can make people feel illusory, maybe Juan is smoking cigarettes containing Gnox mushroom hyphae, it will produce hallucinations, fall from the roof! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first ran to the location of the crime, picked up some cigarette butts on the ground, and then went to the police station. If the cigarette contains the ingredients of Gnoum Mushroom, then those cigarettes must be "processed". That is to say, the tobacco shreds of the cigarettes are poured out, and the hyphae of the grimacing mushroom is added and then put back. There must be residual hyphae in the cigarette case! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you can find the hyphae of Gnoum Mushroom, then Du Lin can't run a second-degree murder. With such a crime, he has more time to dig Du Lin's details, trying to crack the fraud case, and also cracked the gold robbery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to the police station’s exhibit room again, looking for the previous police officer to look at the evidence collected at the scene of the suicide in Juan, in pieces. In the middle, he found a cigarette case that had been burned out. He sat in a room next to the exhibit room and carefully looked at the cigarette case in his hand. This cigarette case is not much different from the cigarette case of most high-end cigarettes. The cigarette case itself is formed by sticking a very thin piece of wood with a layer of wrapping paper on the outside, but the cigarette case has been burnt out, and one of them has a large area of ​​burnt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he looked at the inside of the cigarette case and accidentally found that the tin foil used to wrap the cigarette inside was gone, he looked back and forth several times, back When I arrived at the exhibit room, I checked all the things I found from the scene and Juan. "Is the tin foil in the cigarette case?" He took out the burnt cigarette box and took out his cigarette case. "Hey, is there a layer of tin foil inside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policeman shook his head and said a little impatiently: "Everything is here, if there is If not, then there is no!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp was silent for a moment, went back to the room and continued to play with this cigarette case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, tobacco taxation is far less than other commercial taxes and alcohol taxes, but many people think that tobacco tax will become an important source of tax revenue for the empire. At this time, everyone is still accustomed to planting tobacco or buying it from other farmers. This can solve a lot of expenses. But as the economy of the empire is recovering rapidly, the power of capital is expanding wildly, and the industrial industry will inevitably squeeze the agricultural industry in the future. More and more people will enter the factory instead of planting land in the countryside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who have lost their tobacco enjoyment will have to spend more money to buy cigarettes and let cigarette companies expand quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cigarette packs at this time are all thin and thin like a piece of paper sticking into a box with a wrapper on the outside. Then the cigarette is wrapped in tin foil and stuffed into the cigarette box. Finally, the whole package of cigarettes will be immersed in the oil wax. The purpose of this is to prevent the tobacco inside from getting wet and entering the water. He was thinking about a problem while looking at the burnt cigarette case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can a tin foil-sized tin foil do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicate information? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it still said that after Hu’s death, someone has already moved? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is not right, if you really want to add the grimace mushroom to the tobacco shreds, he took the tin foil, but left it. Cigarette, what is the point of doing this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more things you think about, the more he feels that there is too much hidden behind Juan’s “suicide”. He took a pen and painted the burnt cigarette case, and then returned the cigarette case to the police officer. The first thing to do now is to analyze whether there is a component of the face mushroom in the cigarette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is, Doolin must face the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, then he would consider whether the burned cigarette case was intentional or accidental. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After spending an "expedited fee", at nine o'clock in the evening, he finally got a chemical analysis report of the cigarette butt in hundreds of chemicals. It did not find the composition of the Gnoum Mushroom, which made Amp appear a short-lived sigh of the direction of the case. (I certainly know how many chemical components there are when burning tobacco. I also know how many chemical components can be produced when the tobacco in the outer world burns. This is not a clerical error.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they arrived at the hotel, the agents also came back exhausted. Amp first put the matter aside and looked at the agents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is the investigation of the demonstrations going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one responsible for this matter The detective shook his head. "There is no clue for the time being. The provincial sages who were organized by the organization all died in the 'gang vendetta'. The police station did not seem to care much about this case. There was no detailed investigation transcript, nor any further Follow-up, even some of the exhibits have been disposed of. It is like..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp did not wait for him to finish, then went up and said: "Just like It was the police station that knew the truth of the matter, so they gave up the investigation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, that's the feeling." The detective wanted to find a confidant. , patted the edge of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
