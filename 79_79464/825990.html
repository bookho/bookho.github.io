			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Buddha pulled Delier into the alley, and the pedestrians on the road were a bit strange. Although it is much better to say that Tyran’s law and order is much better than Prando’s reign, it is only relative. Since the new police chief took office, one gang has emerged constantly, and there has always been a fire. Although the police station has been arresting, it can be like being unable to finish. There were a few caught here, and the people who entered them were immediately occupied by another group, and the fight will continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these gangs are not bad, that is, they are not too harassing ordinary people, the world of ordinary people is still the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you see me running?" Du Lin looked up and down Delier, this guy is more feminine than before, to be honest, it makes people a bit nausea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carried a big red lady's small hand bag in front of the chest, slightly sideways, as if it would give him a sense of security. He wore a pale pink dress and a red-brown collar, revealing a somewhat sunken chest. How disgusting it is to be disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s a little impatient tone made Delier a little panic, and his fear of Doolin was deep into the bones, not to be reduced because of the passage of time. . When he saw Du Lin’s words, he immediately replied: “I am not hiding from you, I just suddenly remembered a little...” He swallowed and his throat slipped. He saw Dudu’s hand inserted into his clothes. . He didn't know what was inside, but he certainly wouldn't be a good thing. He immediately lost all the positions and clearly stated the reason why he wanted to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dullin After they left, Delier was neglected by the mayor, and then he was honest for a while, then he found that the mayor seemed to have no mood and no time to keep staring. When he was, he started to run his own business again. After all, he has to eat, he has to pay some money, and he has to spend all kinds of expenses. How many people in the remote town of Turner have art cells, how can he support himself by relying on his art gallery? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he was forced to helpless, but also came into being, and continued to work on pulling the pi, and the development is not bad, even Oro He has opened an art gallery there, and he rarely returns to Tyne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, I returned to Tener with Mrs. Vivian, and now Mrs. Vivian has become the deserved feminine first warrior in Cannes. Many women are her followers, admiring and admiring her, treating her as her. Respect her like an angel. So what Mrs. Vivienne likes to do, those women like to do, for example... Yes, that's it, so Delier wants to maintain his most important customer, and he has become a member of the feminist organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many feminist warriors like to visit his art gallery and find some inspiration from it, which makes him make a lot of money, he imagined Much more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the purpose of Mrs. Vivian’s return is to talk about the marriage with the mayor, and the high-level affirmation of thought makes Mrs. Vivian’s independence. You don't need to rely on anyone, especially a husband who lives in name. She plans to divorce the mayor, and Delier, who is a little worried, has come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mrs. Vivian was returned to the house, he turned around the street and saw the Buddha. As for why it is necessary to run, it is natural to tell this news to Mrs. Vivian. Maybe others still don't know the details of Mrs. Vivian's child, but Delier is definitely clear. When Mrs. Vivian told him the news, he almost let him clean up and sneak away from Turner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mrs. Vivian knew that the Buddha had returned, it might not be helpful to help her in the divorce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explained here, Doolin and Dufo also understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... can I go now?" De Lier carefully squinted and smirked. "I still made an appointment with someone." I have to do some nails...", he said, and the final voice gradually lowered, standing with his head down against the wall and closing his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the Buddha, the latter's face was not very good-looking, he did have such a period of time really liked Mrs. Vivian. Think about it, at that time he was just a little poor guar, and Mrs. Vivian was a noble lady with a high status. The world of the two could never have an intersection, but it was there. In just a few days, they became good friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From passive reaction to active conquest, Buddha enjoys the body and soul. He is not clear until now, is he obsessed with Mrs. Vivian's body and her identity and status, or is it true... I like her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just..., that child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha’s eyes are a bit gloomy, he rarely shows this way, even when he is performing Doolin’s killing order, his face rarely becomes Serious, always a faint smile that looks indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to Delier’s body and touched the already sturdy scorpion under his lips. “Where is Vivienne?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delier shook a bit as he heard the voice, and he whispered the current movement of Mrs. Vivian. They will make nails together at about three o'clock, then take a four-point steam locomotive back to Orodo, and there will be about seven o'clock in the evening, just for dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha raised his wrist and glanced at the watch. It was already two to forty, and there were two appointments between Delier and Vivian. ten minutes. He looked back at Du Lin, with a look of enlightenment in his eyes, and Du Lin shrugged. Dufu grabbed Delier's shoulder and pushed him to the entrance of the alley. "I want to see Vivian, take me to the place you agreed, if you lied to me..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, how can I lie?!" Delier was excited and walked out as he said good things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place they have agreed to is in a coffee shop in the city center, only in the city center, can you feel that it is a city, not a remote township . Sitting in the coffee shop, the wind of the blower is sent into the cooling tube, and it is cool with a hint of coolness. This summer is enough to make people feel comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three had three cups of coffee. After Du Lin and Dudu sat down, Du Lin pointed to a vacancy farther away. Delier was very The look of his own coffee ran to the side of the window. The sunlight outside the house came in through the glass, and the work on the side of the window was empty. Delier sat there with some grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he left, Du Lin asked: "What are you going to do? Is it going to return to your child, just want to meet?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha thought for a moment and asked: "Are you going to persuade me? Actually, I also know that my identity is still worse than Vivienne’s identity. Too much, if the child is in Vivian, it will definitely be much better than following me, but after all, it is my child, my son!", said that the Buddha here is a little excited, he shakes hard Heading, "I don't know what to do, but don't persuade me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it you?" Du Lin took a sip of the coffee and put the coffee back on the table. He didn't touch another bit when he left. He took a deep breath and leaned back to adjust a comfortable posture. "All Buddhas, we are different from before. We used to be the rats of the sewer. Now, we are not living in the sewer. Whether it is What we have done is what we are going to do. In my opinion, we are already the same person as them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Buddha, Just because you are my brother, I will not persuade you, no one in this world can persuade you, what do you want to do, you take your own ideas!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Du Buddha’s serious expression was tightly stretched, and soon he couldn’t help but smile. “Would you like to give me the position of the mayor?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not care, nodded, "If you want!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha raised his hand and waved, just like rushing A fly, "Still forget it, have time to sleep, how good it is, and I don't want to get aging so quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;He just made a joke, but Du Lin was very serious, a mayor's position could not be replaced by a friend and brother who died together. And he faintly guessed why Irian wanted to "catch" him out. On the one hand, his "plate" in Irian is too big, and there has been a looming tendency to get out of control. Nearly 20 million investment, tens of thousands of jobs and a lot of taxes, and he also has contacts with the navy, which proves that he is a "dangerous" person, whether he wants to go directly to politics or change the current situation of Irian It is easy to have a pattern, so I want to drive him to other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, they may want to put him in a cage, just like these politicians treat tycoons who are not enough but have enough potential to continue to develop Strong space. There are so many tycoons in this world. If there are more, what should the empire do? What about politicians? If they say something, will anyone listen to it, who is the real ruler? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ordinary lower-level imperial citizens, the warmth of wearing a stomach is more important than the politician's flashy political speech! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either way, it is enough to form a reason to send Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
