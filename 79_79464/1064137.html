			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the car, the atmosphere was a bit dull, and Alisa looked at the scenery outside the window and didn't know what to think. Du Lin was not very comfortable. Like this kind of thing, you can't say "your family is not something, right when you leave" and so on? And he was actually a little empty in his heart, so he kept silent. When the team entered the traffic, all the Buddha broke the deadlock. He turned back and asked, "Where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at some Alisa, who lost her mind, thought about it and returned to Ziwei Town first. Today is Saturday, the day after tomorrow is the opening ceremony of the aristocratic school. As long as we can get back tomorrow, there will be no problem, and it will not affect their participation in the opening ceremony of the Buddha’s son. It takes about five hours from Oroto to Ziwei Town. It is not so far from the road, but there is no train track between Tyne and Zijing Town. You can only drive or take a bus. Road conditions have always been a problem, and it takes about two hours to reach Ziwei Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still noon, if you go now, you can go home before dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Buddha thought about it, he agreed. He doesn’t want to meet Vivienne too early, otherwise both sides are embarrassed. Now that you have decided to be the stranger you are most familiar with, there is no need to continue to struggle. Vivian has her own business, and both have their own careers. Their origins and social status are doomed to be impossible for them to really come together. Whether it is Vivi's move to the Buddha, or the Buddha's move to Vivian, it is impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because two people are very independent people, independent people often stand for a firm stance, and no one will change easily for anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa has been very silent on the way home, and Du Lin can feel that as she gets closer and closer to the sable, Alisa There are more and more fears. When they got off the train from Turner Station and changed their car to the road in Ziwei Town, Alisa finally spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you tell me about his situation? Where did you get him back?", Alisa’s eyes were filled with tears, that paragraph In time, she was almost going crazy, her child was stolen, and she couldn't find any clues for a whole year. Even the police station told her that the situation was very small. Every year, many children are stolen and trafficked. It is very lucky to find three or five people out of a hundred children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an era when the household registration system was not perfect, there was no monitoring and various high-tech methods of solving crimes, many cases eventually fell into the sea and became the ash in the corners of the archives. Even Alisa went to Otis to find Du Lin’s request for Doolin’s assistance. She did not have any hope. She was purely looking for a kind of psychological comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child was too small when he was taken away, even he himself may not be aware that he was taken away from his parents and left his mother forever. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the miracle comes too fast, happiness comes too suddenly, and Alisa has a hint of fear, will the child blame herself? I blame myself for not doing my best to continue to find him. Instead, I gave birth to a child and used it as a sustenance. At this time, Alisa deeply felt a sense of guilt, and she actually gave up the sin of continuing to find a child. Feeling, as a mother, she actually stopped looking for her own children, which is simply unforgivable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Doolin’s narrative... he compiled a story saying that he found him after a year of lost and was fostered by his father. side. For some reason, he forgot to tell Alisa and this, and she was pregnant again. In order to avoid causing some accidents, he temporarily kept the truth and waited until now, until the daughter’s birth, he quickly told me. She, and want to take her to see the first child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a loophole lie. Anyone with a slightly normal mind will find many loopholes from Doolin’s lies, but at this time Alisa The whole body was firmly attracted by the child who was found back. She couldn't tell how much Du Lin said in the words, how much is true, she only cares about two points. My child is back, and I will see him soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the car drove into the town, Alisa thought that she had not changed her clothes when she left home, nor did she bring some replacement clothes. She was nervous. Looking at Du Lin, while sorting out his appearance, "Is there a place to sell clothes near here? Will I be blamed by him when I wear it like this? Can I buy some clothes from nearby and I will change it again?" She said that she touched her face, "Is it a makeup? If you don't do anything, would it be too ugly? Will he resist me what I am now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin:╰_╯<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car is slowly docked outside Mr. Xmas’s “Villa” The town has suddenly become a stranger to the development of the Xerma family, especially Mason, who has become the regional police chief of the company. Every time he came back, Mr. Kemer was the most proud of it. After all, there was a police chief who called himself a father. This is the only enjoyment of the whole town and even the Tenel area! Except for a moment of onlookers, everyone took the initiative to disperse, and no one wanted to interfere with the family's "warm" reunion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know that you are back?" Mr. Kesma sat in the easy chair and squatted on the pipe. He looked up at Du Lin and sneered twice, letting Du Lin feel the temperature dropped. Du Lin has never returned in the past few years, although sometimes he will contact Mr. Ke Ma by telephone, but Mr. Ke Ma's dissatisfaction is still accumulating. For Mr. Kesma, Du Lin’s absence from the New Year after he went out was a provocation to his years of educational achievements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s getting old, the word of the family is getting more and more heavy in Mr. Xerma’s mind, so that every year he will take it before dinner. Du Lin squatted for a while. When I got out of the cage on a small day, I forgot to go home. This bastard is simply unhuman... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Mr. Kemma in anger, Du Lin can only close his mouth except for laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows Mr. Kemma very well, knowing that Mr. Kesma’s temper is finished, and the argument can only ignite Mr. Kemm’s temper, saying Maybe you still have to beat. Although he has a lot of outside cause, but in the final analysis, after all, he is the son of Mr. Ke Sima, if Mr. Ke Sima have to beat him, he really is not the slightest way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Mr. Kesma’s squat for a while, the expression on his face suddenly softened a lot, and Du Lin thought that the matter was over, I didn’t expect him. Just after a move, Mr. Xema’s eyebrows were erected again. He still didn't understand what the softening of the moment was, and a familiar voice sounded behind him. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "Ke Sima family's old stuff, come the possession of your grandchildren, you do not come I'll smack him!" <br /> <br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, along with a laughing child's voice and a dog's screams, Du Lin couldn't help but go back. He saw a three- or four-year-old child holding a dog and opening a short leg and laughing while running. The poor dog struggled with miserable mourning, but could not break the rope that had to be old. One end of the rope was caught in the hand by the child, and the other was tied to the dignity of the dog as a male dog. The pace of each run represented a severe pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter fierce woman has been chasing, but I can see that she is not catching up, just want to tease the little boy to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Du Lin felt a pain in the eardrum, a woman, Mrs. Kesma, who had a rolling pin in her hand and rushed out of the house. Standing next to Du Lin, he yelled "Who dares," and then shouted "Dear, run slowly, don't wrestle" and ran towards the child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
