			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin is full of aspirations for a new life and a new world. He left the city of Otis. He knows that Doolin does not want to kick himself. It is true. I am good, so he has no complaints. In the country, Mr. Xerma did not seem to be planning to teach them to read the words. There was no school in Zizhen Town. It is also possible that Mr. Kemer intends to use this method to create children's fear of the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the truth, Merlin finally took a solid first step. On the train to Nano Lindes, it seems that the noise of the train is annoying. He opens the window and looks at the vibrant world outside the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Merlin arrived in Nal Lindes, there was a negotiation in a restaurant not far from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negotiations between Chester’s boss and the Andy brothers, Andy’s brothers want to intervene in the sale of Mr. Abel, so that’s it. A "consultation." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel is a native of the Lindanders. His father is a blacksmith. When he was fifteen, he used the awl in the blacksmith shop. After the death of two adults, he became famous and became a famous "child party" leader. After a nine-month sentence - his blacksmith father hired a good lawyer, and through the testimony of some witnesses, it was proved that the other party was provocative, so the majority of Abel’s sentence was reduced, and finally because "considering fifteen years old Juveniles dare to fight for death, if they do not give a certain education and punishment, it is difficult to imagine what kind of person he will become in adulthood. This is the reason that he was finally sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he served his sentence for nine months, his blacksmith father bailed him out with a hundred and fifty dollars and ended his sentence early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Abel, who was sixteen years old, became a famous gang in the street because he killed people and all the teenagers who were about the same age as him. He was convinced that he had described Abel in that period, saying that his eyes were like knives, and that his eyes were always the illusion that he would always give you a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel after his release from prison did not follow a path of crime full of evil as others thought, instead he used his prestige and Fame, a group of teenagers of the same age, began a career as a thug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In prison and outside the prison, he was transformed into an unexpected person through nine months. He also learned from this experience of power, money and status what this society means. Instead of going directly to crime, he chose to serve those who are powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a young man who is very early thinking, because most people realize that this is already twenty or thirty years old, but he is ten I understood this truth when I was six years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, he often went to the police station, even the court, but he was not in prison, because when he happened, the big guys behind him would Money or find someone to send him out. This has increasingly made him affirm that the path he has chosen is correct and has been here today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of doing so many years of dirty work has also developed his somewhat distorted character. Simply put, Abel’s face is faster than flipping a book. You may also be asked about what you need to do before, but after you take a call, you may get a knife into your body. He is a very pure person, a person who lives for money and his own purposes, and is also a very careful person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His only advantage may be that he is good to the people around him, and this is to maintain his current status and status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Klaus intends to intervene in his sale, which makes him a bit annoyed. He once had a war with Klaus and both sides suffered damage. At that time, a rich man moved out of Nam Lindes and moved to the Imperial Capital. His things were packed on the train. As a result, the steam locomotive was hijacked by the Andy brothers. The rich found Abel and promised 100,000 pieces. Send things to the capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel explained his request after contacting Klaus through other relationships, but Klaus, who had never dealt with Abel, directly rejected him. The proposal resulted in the two sides fighting in the wild. As a result, the outsiders are not clear, but since then, Claus will try to restrain himself when facing Abel, and will not provoke this person. Abel will also keep a distance and not actively approach Klaus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, the two old rivals had to sit together again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel doesn’t look like a bad guy, he wears very expensive clothes, and the shoes are bright enough to illuminate the figure. The cheeks are also well maintained, and the chin is blue, giving a somewhat weird feeling, like the weird doctor in the opera Dr. Monster. He is very particular about it, probably because he is often in contact with people in the upper class, so he values ​​his image very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Claus, rushing into the business of others, and intending to snatch the interests of others, this is a very despicable act of villain..." Abel said with a face, shaking his head like Klaus Let him be very disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus is also dressed well, and may be lower in taste, but the price of the clothes and accessories on his body is not necessarily Bo is cheap. He snorted and interrupted Abel's words. "Mr. Yabo, today we are sitting here to discuss how to cooperate, not to give you the opportunity to face me to reprimand me.", Claus took out The hand rubbed the stain that did not exist on the finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What we are discussing is how to achieve a win-win goal!", Claus is acting like a civilized person, a businessman, but knows this guy. Abraham of the inside understands that this is a villain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel snorted, "If you snatch the business that originally belonged to me, I also intend to divide my profit in the case of disagreement. It is a kind of cooperation and Win-win, it’s better to work with Mr. Claus, you also go to find a business like this, let me also take a hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aaron sitting on the side eating suddenly Raising his hands and letting go of the cow's bones in his hand, he curled his legs back and slammed his feet to the table. The table suddenly slammed into Abel. Abel had already lived behind the scenes for years. I don't know if he didn't respond, or he was afraid of it, just like he didn't see the table that was about to hit himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, an arm stretched out from behind his shoulder and held the table tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aaron’s eyes suddenly turned red, and he knew the guy, called Spike’s guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sudden conflict caused the two groups in the room to stand up, and they clearly defined the table as the boundary, and Klaus and Abel was arched up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Is it going to fight?" Abel was not afraid of Andy’s brother. He took out a cigarette on his mouth, one arm. Press on the table and lean forward. "You nod your head. I promise that only one of us can leave. If not, it is best to put your claws away, either here or Otis. Where you can be wild!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished speaking, he spit a cigarette and spit on Claus. The Klaus had the smoke on his face. He smiled and calmed as before. "Is this your choice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel shrugged his shoulders and stood up, straight The door of the restaurant went. "Before threatening others, think about whether you have the ability..." When standing at the door, Abel leaned forward and looked at Klaus, who was facing him. "Some People are you can't afford to sin, understand? Not everyone will let you be slaughtered like those fools. Here, you are just reptiles on the ground!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Abel walked out of the restaurant with a smile. He looked at the watch on his wrist. In the afternoon, there was a big man who needed his help. He didn't have time to spend time with the Andy brothers. These two guys are just lions made of paper in his eyes, and they are scary in appearance, and they will not be afraid of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Going to drive the car..." Abel ordered, and his driver immediately ran diagonally across. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, three cars came from the end of the street, Abel just glanced at it, and the heart immediately felt like an invisible hand. It’s the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a person who walks in the gray area, there is always an instinctive reaction to the crisis. He narrows his neck and squats on the ground, leaning against the road. The side of the car and this as a cover. The next second, the guys with the caps in the window lifted the weapons in their hands and pulled the trigger at a group of people who were a little confused at the restaurant door. The bullets tilted out, and in just a few seconds a dozen people fell into a pool of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three cars started again, leaving quickly, and soon disappeared into the chaotic streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klaus and Abel, who had a bone in his hand, came out of the restaurant. Aaron glanced at Spike, who had a painful face on the ground. He walked over in a blank expression. He lifted his foot and stepped on his face. The toes continued to work hard, and the pointed leather tips were deeply caught. Spike's eyes are in the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slamming, a bloody liquid mixed with a transparent liquid ejected from the gap between the toe and the eyelid, Aaron frowned, he The shoes are dirty. He threw away the bones in his hands and lifted his legs hard, stepping on Spike's head... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
