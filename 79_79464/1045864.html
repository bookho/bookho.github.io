			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday night, two days later, some tired Carter came out of the steam locomotive and looked around, leaning towards a roadside The dilapidated car went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was no longer the branch of the Irian Association at the time of last year, and this position was handed over to another person. He spends most of his time at home, and his mental condition is not very good. Especially after Du Lin left Irian, he often had auditory hallucinations and illusions in the middle of the night. The doctor at the Irian side said that he had been very irritated, causing abnormalities in his cerebral cortex, so there would be some abnormalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, Du Lin knew about it and asked him to check it out at the Imperial Capital. At the beginning, Carter was not willing to check, he felt that he is now The situation is not too big a problem. Although sometimes it will cause some trouble to life, as long as he is locked in the bedroom at night, he will not hurt anyone. For this negative attitude, Du Lin asked Jose to send him to the ferry and sent it to the Imperial Capital. After the best inspection plan of the three hospitals in the Imperial Capital, the three hospitals all achieved the same result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter has a tumor in his head, because Carter refused to do a puncture, so it is not clear whether the tumor is benign or malignant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, whether it is benign or malignant, there is not much difference, because the hospital also said that this tumor has a thick thumb, surgical removal The success rate is very low. The brain has always been the most complicated and vulnerable part of human body organs. Doctors in any hospital can't guarantee that they can succeed in such an operation. The highest success rate is only 30%. The chance that Carter can survive from the operating table is not guaranteed whether he can continue to live and live for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t seem to care about this loss Carter himself. In fact, when his wife and children left the world because of the Fowlers, he I intend to follow my wife and children to leave the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin saved him and gave him the opportunity to revenge, and also let him find the meaning of life, that is, the fellowship, and his other child . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the life of the next day has to take his life, but he doesn’t care at all, actually in his own heart, in the gardener’s house that night. When he was dead. Now he has a lot of deposits, about 200,000 or so. His children have also gone to middle school and can live independently. With this money, with the care of Du Lin and fellow villagers, he no longer has to worry about anything for his children. He also believes that if his child really encounters something, Du Lin will definitely lend a helping hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Du Lin assigned a task to him, he agreed without hesitation, which would be a "suicidal" assassination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss went to the resettlement area...the place where the refugees built the city. He is not suitable to stay here now, so I can only pick you up." Ellis drove the car seriously. Doolin left yesterday morning, but he also told Carter about his mission. He is not a young man who is good at expressing his inner feelings in words. He really wants to say something to comfort Carter, but he can't find any sentence that makes him feel that he is in line with his own meaning. He can only keep silent as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The card features a nod to indicate that he knows, Du Lin has already explained clearly on the phone, this time, whether successful or not, Du Lin promises to take good care of it. His child, let the guy have a happy life. For this, Carter still believes in Doolin. His only requirement is to let the child live well and be an ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dull atmosphere in the car continued until a small hotel near the ring road, where Carter will stay for one night and then tomorrow morning at Mennon At the meeting, assassinated the doorman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the floor, the two people walked into the hotel, walked through the dim, and pushed open a door. The room looks good, but it doesn't stop the musty smell coming from behind the wallboard and the black through the wallpaper. This is a very ordinary room in a very small hotel. In order to avoid any accidents, Carter will rest here this evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice saw the suitcase in his hand on the only small round table in the room and opened it. There are two very thick wire-bound books and some files that look like they are worthwhile. He picked up one of the wire-bound books tied with a tie and opened it after removing the tie. From the outside, this is a complete book, but in fact many pages have been hollowed out, and there is a pistol lying quietly inside. There are also two magazines in the other book, which are opened to avoid being too heavy and let the person in charge of the security want to take a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Averys took out an invitation and placed it on the table. "This is an invitation to enter the venue tomorrow morning. You must show this invitation. Before you go in, there will be security personnel to do a simple check on the things you carry, so don't go too early. There are no people who go early, their inspections will be careful, and they should not go too late. At that time, the work is very close, and they will become serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When there are a lot of people coming together, you'd better be able to step in and they won't check too carefully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After saying, Ellis A paper bag in the alley was taken out and contained more than 20 photos. "This is the photo of the venue. The position we arranged for you is in the middle of the second row. You can get there at that position. Look at the whole body of the doorman, the distance is sixteen meters. You choose the time you think is the best, I have a suggestion...", Ellis took out a black envelope and placed it on the table. on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When there are multiple slides during the conference, the lights will be temporarily turned off at that time, which lasts about six minutes. This is the best. Opportunity. The dim light can make that many people unable to see your little movements, they will not start screaming before you even shoot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be about twenty to thirty bodyguards, but they won't appear on the stage, and the nearest one is a few meters away from the farmer. If you can, it's best to leave there alive." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter smiled and didn’t speak. When he came from Irian, he didn’t plan to go back alive. Anyway, he was a person who could live for a long time, head The tumors are growing at an alarming rate, and some doctors think the tumor may be more malignant. Instead of lying in a hospital bed and dying in torture, it is better to use your own life to exchange the happiness of your child for a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried the gun pistol and fired it twice. The crisp crash of the metal proved that the gun had no problem. After checking the nature and the bomber again, he returned them to the original place and re-tied the tie and put it back in the suitcase. Then he checked every thing, including the photos of the scene. After re-passing the plan of tomorrow in his head, he raised a new question. One did not explain the problem of Ellis in Du Lin. problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This black post, am I on my own, or in the vicinity of the doorman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a problem. Ellis opened his mouth and didn't know how to answer it. Finally, he ran out and made a phone call to find the answer. "Boss said that if you put it in a conspicuous place, you can prove it." The death of Mennon is related to the black post."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, go back, I need to take a break." Carter burned some sensitive things, put everything else up and put it on the box, revealing a smile. "You will let me here." Become nervous, rest assured, I am fine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice does not know what to say, can only nod his head, his hands are a little irritating Your own ass. He sighed, turned and quickly left, and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter calmly walked to the bed and did it, then slowly lying on the bed, he showed a painful look from time to time. The things in my head have been afflicting him. It used to be an illusion, and now it is pain all the time. In the past, the doctor gave him some painkillers. The little pills worked well. After eating, the whole person was much more comfortable. But when the efficacy of the drug passed, the sudden and severe pain made him feel bad, and he decided not to take any painkillers anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can you surpass the pain of losing his wife and losing his daughter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pain, he became a little numb, even adapted to this all-time pain, but the degree of pain has increased a bit recently, but this is not a problem . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is getting darker, night falls, and the deep night shrouds Vanlier, making everything here quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning at 8:45, Carter carrying a suitcase appeared on time outside the Opera House. Because this time the farmer invited a lot of mine owners, the city hall's conference room could not accommodate so many people, so he temporarily rented the Vanlier Opera House. At this time, a lot of vehicles have been docked in the nearby open space, and all the miners have arrived, so that some citizens stayed there for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 8:55, the flow of people began to increase, and Carter walked around the flower bed and headed for the door. He wore very expensive clothes and looked It is no different from the surrounding mine owners. The temperament that I developed when I was a president of the branch made him look more identity than the mine owners around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, in order to ensure the safety during the conference, so you can open your suitcase, we have to do a simple check. If there is offense to you Place, I hope you can forgive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
