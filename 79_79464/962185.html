			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ferry docked, Hossington returned from the shackles. Who can think that more than a year ago, Du Lin was just an ordinary businessman under his rule... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the businessman who is a little threatening to him, he heard people say that Du Lin is going to stand for election, so he kicked out Du Lin with one foot, and he still thought I want to earn some political contributions from Doolin. As a result, what he didn't think was that Du Lin was much better than he had imagined, not only did he need to rely on him to survive in the state of Cosnas, but also lived very moist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this time, someone always mentions Doolin in his ear, mentions the city of Otis, and sometimes mentions him, but most of them are not worthy of him. Happy to say, such as these people taunt his stupidity in the lines. Du Lin, who has enough talent and "strength", does not stay with his own hands but because he is afraid to send him away, but let the goddess of fate kiss Doolin's forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s stupid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mentor also thinks this is a failed plan, but no one has done anything wrong, no one can think of Du Lin in that environment can actually Quickly developed a desolate city, and withstood the pressure at the beginning, turning the city of Otis into the jewel of the middle of the empire with the idea of ​​arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has gained great prestige for Du Lin, and it has also made people see his ability. This is definitely a good young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, he must stand here to meet Du Lin, because their identity is almost the same, and in turn can say that the mayor of Irian, Lord Hawthorn, Shorted in front of Du Lin. Because he wants to run for the governor of Cosnas, he has a good relationship with Harry. Three years later, as long as Harry was elected prime minister, he will be nominated as the governor of Cosna. The nomination is a nomination, a campaign or a vote that requires a campaign. The appointed successor will not be born in most cases because the successor represents an extension of the political plan of the former governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one more Du Lin in it, and Hossington is not sure if Du Lin knows what he is doing, just in case he runs for the governor. The stick is definitely a painful blow to his governor's dream! He has now become a person who has a request for Doolin - hope that Du Lin will be on his side during the campaign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ferry pushed open the thick fog in the winter morning, and the stiff muscles on Horston's face shook in the winter wind before he squeezed a smile. He stood by the ramp and stared at Du Lin. Come down from the ramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the empty street, Doolin shook hands with Hossington. "This winter break seems to be a bit colder than in previous years!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horseton nodded. "The number of visitors to Ilyan two months before the winter break this year has dropped dramatically, and some small workshops have gone bankrupt. And debt management, some people chose to leave Irian to the South to find opportunities, so it will appear relatively deserted.", he reached out and invited Du Lin to get into the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of his words is nothing more than the city of Otis in the promotion of the effort to take away some of the tourists belonging to Irian, let Irian in A serious economic recession occurred two months before the winter break, causing a wave of bankruptcies that were not serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irian As a tourist city with tourism as the mainstay of the economy, there is a huge demand for tourist traffic. Once the flow of people is reduced, all aspects of the city will be very serious. The impact is even more terrifying. Those handicraft workshops that do not have the ability to resist risks begin to have a backlog of a large number of commodities but no one cares. As a result, some of the shops and workshops that borrowed and dumped goods were unable to repay their loans, and they had to choose bankruptcy. This way ends the business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recession in a region does not only create a problem that is absolutely diverse and complex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holston's complaints hidden in the words are indeed what he thinks. After all, there are so many tourists in the empire, although they will grow every year. The popularity of the city of Otis will inevitably affect other places to a certain extent, not only in Hossington, but also in the same city. The only thing that has not been affected is the South, where nearly one-third of the major consumer groups are from the Commonwealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car is constantly moving into the eighth district after spending the newly constructed ring road. There are obviously more people here, not only local celebrities, There are also some film workers from the Imperial Capital, as well as a large number of reporters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eighth district is the official name of the "cradle of the imperial film", which was set at the time of the initial construction - everything is for the movie service. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
