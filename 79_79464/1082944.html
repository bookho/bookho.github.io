			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, the outcome of this negotiation is ending sooner than all participants expected, which is also a good thing. After signing the contract tomorrow, Southern Commercial Bank can directly reverse the current situation. They can even stand with Doolin to sue the Imperial Bank for infringing their "patent rights." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a joke, and the Southern Commercial Bank can also get out of Doolin’s lawsuit, and they have become victimized from the identity of the victim. In addition, in the face of social and public opinion issues, there will be a lot of positive comments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw Duolin’s news, I didn’t think I had anything, but when I was on the news with Du Lin, I could understand those people’s Feel it. A senior reporter said that Du Lin will always be a weak person. No matter how much money he has and what kind of status he has, people can only see him being persecuted again and again. Then the group in the society may not even have enough food and clothing. The sympathy of the people will help him win the most public opinion assistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is the same, how the South Bank and the Imperial Central Bank are many times stronger than Doolin, so Du Lin is weak, and the identity of the weak makes Du Lin I have received a lot of support from the public. In particular, the positive image he has maintained has also drawn a large number of middle class standing on Doolin's position, which is a very headache. Every faint disgust will not bring any tragic consequences, but when these disgusts become a force that cannot be ignored, the cost of continuation will gradually emerge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the problem is solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the restaurant, Du Lin and Natiya talked a few words and left. He didn’t have a rest all day, and he slept at night. After two hours or so, physical and mental exhaustion, he needs rest now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the executive director of the imperial central bank woke up from his sleep. When people are older, there are always many problems, and they sleep a little. Also wake up early. He wore a sports suit and jogged in the gym for a while, took a shower, put on clean clothes and sat in the dining room to enjoy the rare comfort of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pot of scented tea without too many petals, the doctor advised him not to drink coffee and other stimulating drinks, he now doesn’t even drink alcohol, and some Pure wheat suppresses the baked wheat cake, there is no oil, he needs to be responsible for his own cardiovascular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At such a young age, with such a prominent status, he is no longer simply enjoying, but allowing himself to live for a few more days. Money, power, woman, he needs to enjoy him, he has already enjoyed it. From now on, he understands that the most enjoyable thing in life is time, the time he has been squandered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening a newspaper has not had time to watch carefully what news is worthy of this morning, and his face has changed dramatically. The cup that had just been picked up was directly dropped on the table, stood up and went to the phone to pick up the phone, dialed a number, and asked angrily, "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who answered the phone put the newspaper in the hand on the cupboard and said with a wry smile, "It seems that Du Lin seems to have reached an agreement with the South Business Bank that we don't know..." He looked at it. A look at today's Imperial Daily, the headline on the front page of the daily newspaper made him feel like his body was hollowed out - "Operational Play", the subtitle was "Dulin's revocation of the lawsuit against the South China Bank." The content of this title is like its paper meaning. South Commercial Bank is now free from the trouble of the lawsuit and transferred all the pressure to the imperial central bank. The current lawsuit is no longer a group play, only two opponents, Du Lin and the Empire. Central bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Southcomer and Dulin must have reached an invisible transaction to a certain extent, and may even stand at the South Bank when necessary. In the position of Doolin, the pressure on the imperial central bank, including the use of social resources to make the imperial central bank more ugly, and promote the final trend of the three lawsuits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former imperialist central bank slammed the bankers of the South Commercial Bank, and the hatred that almost slammed them into bankruptcy liquidation was not so easy to put it down, plus The coveted market of many commercial predators in the south against the closed market in the north and the dissatisfaction with some investment behaviors of the imperial central bank are likely to turn into a large-scale vicious competition. Even if this is less than one in ten thousand, it is definitely a big danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s chest was violently ups and downs, and neither of them spoke. After a while, the old man’s chest was not so obvious, he gave a sigh of relief. Said, "I want to know what they did, and, you have to give the council a solution, I don't want to listen to the old things, give me something new."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the newspapers reported this news all day long. The South Commercial Bank had already prepared for the negotiations before sending the negotiating team. If they can talk to Du Lin, they will quickly let the people know that the South Bank is also Victims, but they do not participate in the lawsuit between Doolin and the central bank, to ensure that they are in the best position, no matter who wins and who loses, there will be no loss. If they can’t talk about it, then they will promote another set of things, such as Doolin’s black history, and “general law” for the general public, let them know that Doolin is now untenable in the lawsuit, he is a Patent rogue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, together with the imperial central bank, Du Lin was forced back to the negotiating table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, they don’t intend to really tear the face with Du Lin, because it’s not worth it, and no one can guarantee the final direction of the lawsuit, so They need Doolin to go back to the negotiating table and continue to talk, and finally get what they want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s cooperation has made Nanshang Bank occupy a great advantage. After being passive and becoming active, some people inside the South Commercial Bank have some new ideas, for example. Helping Doolin to press the Imperial Bank, and there are more and more people who have this idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is very simple. If you don’t consider other means of not seeing light, just talk about commercial competition, Du Lin is not an opponent of South Commercial Bank, and the same is not an empire. The opponent of the central bank. Helping the imperialist central bank out of the predicament and riding on its own head, it is better to help a young man who is not destined to be his opponent, to contain the imperialist central bank, they only need to pay a small price. At that time, it was possible to further swallow a part of the Imperial Bank's territory and take a step back to ensure that its interests are not infringed. This is a very good situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At ten o'clock in the morning, one hour earlier than the deadline given by Doolin, Angelo came to Doolin's estate with a lawyer's team. Examine the contract text for any additions and deletions to the lawyers to do, and these big people chat in the garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your propaganda offensive is very fierce. Many newspapers today report the news of our cooperation." The two stood in the garden of Doolin. Day, Natiya rested under a parasol not far away, she was a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angrio laughed. "Don't you think this is good? We showed our attitude and put a lot of pressure on the imperial central bank. I believe that you should be very interested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some respects, this is indeed the case. The sudden change in the position of the South Commercial Bank has made the Imperial Central Bank more passive. But this is not exactly a good news. If the imperialist central bank is forced to change its strategy, Du Lin will face more unknown risks, but things have already happened. It is totally useless to say that. Dooling knew that he had been pitted. This can't blame anyone. He also drank some wine last night, forgetting or saying that he didn't want South Commercial Bank to temporarily announce this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
