			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people think that the fire department is not a power department, but a service department. After all, once there is a fire or someone has trouble, the first thing they think of is the fire station, and the firefighters wearing helmets and heavy equipment. But in fact, the power of the fire station is very large. Many gangs not only have to supply a copy to the police station, but also to the fire station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Imperial Law, all facilities have a maximum capacity limit and must have fire equipment. In the city of Tener, the most profitable trade is almost inseparable from the bar, and the bar itself is also a huge source of cash. The daily sales of fruit wine and private wine can provide gangs with far more benefits than other channels, so if they want to operate the bar, they must have a good relationship with the fire department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone offends the fire station, the bar is closed and rectified is just the most basic trick, there was once a gang behind the bar because of the amount of money and fire There was a dispute between the bureaus, and as a result the economic source of the gang, a well-functioning bar was put to the point where it had to close. The fire station said that the bar had fire hazards and the design was unreasonable. The maximum number of guests in the bar of nearly 500 square meters was not allowed to exceed ten people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, not only must face the closure of the rectification, but also pay a large fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last bar was closed, the gang behind the bar spent a lot of money looking for a middleman, admitted to the fire station his mistake, and promised to follow the rules, I changed the bar to a name and reopened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the police station is a knife that hangs on the gang’s head, then the fire station is a gun hidden in the shadows. If you offend any party in the absence of your own strength, it will be difficult to continue to mix in the city of Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin gave the police chief a key, and naturally he would not forget the fire station. He smiled and had a sincere expression on his face. Every word bite very clearly. "I recently opened a company, just on Queen's Road. Now I am renovating. I heard people say that there have been several fires on Queen's Road and many people have been burned. It is too It’s terrible. I am a very timid person. If I can, I hope that Mr. Gao Wen can take the time to guide the installation of our fire protection facilities and the decoration problems.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gao Wen still squinted, not smirking, but his eyes were softer. He clicked and could see that his body was relaxed. "It is the responsibility of our fire station to serve every taxpayer. You will leave an address and I will personally go to the scene to supervise."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meal, if you haven’t eaten, you will have an extra charge, which makes Prando and Gao Wen very satisfied. Prando even smiled and said to Kevin. Your friend is very interesting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your friend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not my friend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no direct name for Doolin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that he forgot what Du Lin called, nor that he didn’t want to be friends with Du Lin, but they’re still not sure, is Du Lin really there? Sincerity and they become friends. To know that they are highly weighted, there are many people who want to be friends with them, but few people who can show enough sincerity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin didn’t say anything, just looking at the calm Doolin with a very surprised look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bribing has become a hidden rule that must exist. Even the mayor has a part that says that the source of funds is placed in the bank’s anonymous account. Even the governors, state legislators, and members of the upper and lower parliament, no one can escape from this whirlpool. Some people are self-destructive, and some people have to learn to let themselves fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become a big opponent when jumping out of the general trend, except that it will be killed by the rolling wheels, it will be killed by the waves of Qitian, basically not Has any effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although everyone is taking money from outside to their pockets, there are ways to get money. For those who have lower grades, such as patrol patrols on the roadside, there is no need to bribe these patrols. They directly put 20 pieces in their pockets and keep them in any form. The other party is satisfied. However, for higher-level officials like Prando and Gao Wen, the red fruit will not receive any help and favor from them except for offending them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin did not say how to pay bribes, but Du Lin was born to play a set of ways he had never seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the Imperial Central Bank’s personal safe must contain large amounts of cash, and as long as Prando took the key and opened the cabinet, he had the money. As for accepting bribes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t be kidding, he just picked up a key, didn’t control his curiosity and greed very well, it’s not a mistake, he can only say It is morally lacking. This is not a crime. The superior will not negate his ability in the work because of a person's moral problems. Moreover, "communication" may not be solved. It is because of this very secret bribery that Du Lin has won the favor of two big men when he first met, which is very rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin is a 25-year-old or a 30-year-old 40-year-old guy, Kevin will feel normal and grow up and live. I haven’t been hanged for so long, and I’ve basically had enough experience. But this guy is only sixteen years old. Where did his experience come from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some things are really scary when you think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meal was eaten by the host and the guests, Du Lin first left, during the meal, Kevin and the two directors did not say anything more secretive, he knew It is because he is an outsider. So he felt that it was almost the same, and he proposed to leave something first, leaving the three people with private space and time. For Du Lin’s farewell three-person eyes with some good feelings, such a young man who is sensible is really rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the door closed, Prando laughed. He patted his pocket and smiled and said: "This kid is very interesting, just don't know him. Is sincerity as plentiful as he has been."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin licked his teeth, picked his eyebrows and said in a vague voice: "Do not worry, There will be no less than one number."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number is the meaning of 10,000 pieces. For the small place of Tener, the bribe is 10,000 pieces. It's a bit... too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando and Gao Wen also moved, according to the rules they set, each month the gang was donated to the police station by a socially caring businessman. And the nominal benefits of the money and materials of the fire station, that is, three or five thousand pieces are in place. The money will not fall into their pockets. From top to bottom, every police officer, every firefighter, even the door can be divided into parts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
