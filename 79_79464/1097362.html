			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit casually!" There are many chairs on this platform for fishing, as well as round tables, but there are no umbrellas. The climate in the valley is very pleasant, not as hot and humid as the coastal cities outside, and the brutal sunshine is particularly mild at this time. Occasionally, a cool breeze blows, wrinkles the lake, and blows the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin chose to sit down in a position, and there was a chair between the old man. The old man glanced at him and smiled and shook his head. In my impression, you are not such a regular person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man did not hide his own information on Du Lin, he did not look down on Doolin The idea is that this is the biggest difference between the federal and the empire. Strictly speaking, in the past many years, only those who can't get along in the empire will come to the "commercial alliance" at that time. It is like a place dedicated to the social failure, and the only one. Aristocratic place. The people here can be said to be "free people". The status of the free people is lower than that of the citizens. It is higher than the slaves. In the eyes of the nobles, the free people and slaves are almost the same, that is, the people in the aristocratic mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how many generations of the elderly have never been aristocrats, he naturally does not have the innate arrogance and pride of the nobles, the origin of Du Lin I don't care at all, but I value Du Lin's resume. From the son of a farmer to the young Toshihiko who is known as the empire, in addition to the coincidence, Du Lin’s own ability is more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone, and still many people regard Doolin’s success as luck, as a situation in which the situation of the heroes is created, but these people will never Understand why you have no luck, why you are not the "chess" that are being pushed forward when the current situation is in demand. You can only secretly envy and hate the conspiracy theories that may exist but are more grievous to explain the success of others. Coincidence, and the reasons for failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and thought about it and replied, "You are the elder and the elders. Let us abandon our achievements. I respect you." The age, experience and experience of the baptism of the years are irrelevant!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man also laughed, he pointed to Du Lin, "The way you compliment others is very special. But it sounds like some, is this saying that I am old?", after he said he couldn’t help but laugh, "The first time someone respects me because I am old, not because I have money, or I have Right, you are a very special person, Doolin. You are different from many things in this world. I am very curious. How can you see through so many things and find the most correct direction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the things that Doolin has done over the years may seem to have been wrong at first, and he chose the wrong route, but no matter how he chose in the past, look at his current achievements, you will know those seemingly The wrong choice is actually the most correct. It may not meet the needs of the situation at the beginning, but the continued power of these choices affects the future, correcting the mistakes he might seem at the beginning of the selection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Du Lin was very daring, not so disciplined at first, the old man was very familiar with the imperial hierarchy, and Magus directly abolished the class after he took office, but The class still exists in the social system, perhaps not as obvious as it used to be, but it exists after all. There is an invisible barrier between class and class. The existence of this barrier is to prevent more people from occupying the top of the tower. In fact, the Federation is the same, but the way the empire is promoted is less and more difficult. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this young man is too courageous to break up a barrier in an unusual way, quickly completing the initial accumulation and becoming an imperial empire. Every time he makes a choice plays a vital role in these processes. This is also the most wonderful place for the elderly. One person can succeed many times in succession, but it is absolutely impossible not to fail at all. It is obvious that Du Lin is One exception, he wants to know how Doolin did it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is eager to succeed, he is also. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said a few words, only to use a seemingly low-key, but very confident tone, "Do you want to know my secret?", the old man nodded He joked and said, "I can see through the long river of time and see the future through the fog!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man stunned, and Du Lin thought he would smile. Said that he said, but the old man actually began to meditate. In fact, Du Lin also has a similar situation, that is, his constant success, never fails, has made some people feel curious, and even have a feeling of incomprehensibility, it seems that he is doing right. Otherwise how could he continue to succeed, and have not failed once? People longed for him to fail once to break the myth that he never fails, let him go down from certain altars and return to the ordinary. But at the same time, these people don’t want him to fail, because as long as he does not fail, he is equal to a beacon, his actions, his actions, he The thoughts tell people how to be in the future, how to adapt to this trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the reason why Magus can tolerate him all the time. In addition to his very capable and very thoughtful ideas, he has not only brought serious consequences to the seemingly confusing things, but has made Magma There is a feeling of going through a dark and narrow tunnel into a new world, and everything is suddenly open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He colluded with the Navy, whether as a businessman or as a new party, this is a taboo. However, Magus allowed him to leave him alone, because the Navy and Du Lin had a lot of benefits in collusion with these businessmen like Du Lin. The empire did not need to give the Navy a penny of military spending, it would be able to maintain the navy's expenses, including the renewal of equipment and a small number of military exercises, which eased the embarrassment of the imperial financial constraints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like the Empire has completely lost its connection with the Navy, but don’t forget that the soldiers of the Imperial Navy are citizens of the Empire, and their families are The citizens of the empire, who lived in the empire from an early age, even now form an alienated atmosphere in consciousness, but in the event of a war, the navy will still defend the empire. Moreover, there have been some secret contacts between the military and the navy for some time. Since the turmoil in the west, several senior generals of the Ministry of Defense and the Navy have reached some opinions... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the SAR of the city of Otis, because of Doolin, Magus approved the SAR, a special administrative region with special significance, and the facts prove that the five SARs Already solved a lot of trouble for the empire, those small troubles do not say, big, such as taxation and financial problems, have made breakthrough progress. The five major SARs have paid at least 2 billion yuan in tax revenue each year. This was simply unimaginable in the past, and even Magus was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things he made seem ridiculous and seemingly confusing, but they can always bring about some changes and bring about some ideological changes and progress. is the most important. While Magus was watching him, he also hoped that he could make more contributions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are paying attention to him, believe him, and even have a trace of worship or fear, but he is not so clear. In Du Lin's point of view, he just did what he was supposed to do. It was as simple as that. What he did was not a great thing for him. The decades of experience in the dream made him understand very clearly. The world and the world in dreams are still too different! Therefore, he subconsciously neglected a point. What may be ordinary things in a dream is impactful to the backward world of reality. It is of revolutionary significance, and it can be a matter of the state and even the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
