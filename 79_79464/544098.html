			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to the temporarily concealed residence, the Buddha immediately greeted him. He knows that Doolin went out today to solve the threat that Códdor poses to them. He is also very nervous, because the current fellowship is far worse than Gedor in terms of scale and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come is different from Wood, Wood has already washed white, the so-called whitewashing is not just to completely erase some things that could not be known to most people in the past. It is also necessary to divest some of the unsuitable things from the main body, such as the many thugs he once had, the many weapons, and some illegal business. He was like a tiger with his claws and fangs removed, and he was introduced into the cage by the adults, and then put a label on the outside of the cage, the content is "tycoon." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks really incomparable. Everyone knows that Tycoon Wood, in fact, the real situation, only his own heart is clear. Whether it is to maintain his own decent or status, he can not do things that are detrimental to his status. He can't keep a lot of thugs, can't do business that violates the rules of the game, and can't do it directly, as before. No matter what happens to him, he must follow the rules and follow the rules of the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin did not hesitate to deal with Wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going to deal with a tiger who has forgotten how to shred his prey with claws and fangs and laughs at the jungle. What he has to deal with is just a gentleman who has been restricted by the big men with rules and regulations, and even the resistance is difficult to achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in Codor, he has not been bound by the rules of the game, although he has been obeying this rule, he is not a tycoon in the upper class, he Just a dirty gang leader. What he did before he crossed the hurdle was acceptable to everyone. Hey, isn't he a gang leader? Doesn't he do what he does? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it’s a very troublesome thing for Gotall, Doolin, and Dufo, a carefree association that was just formed. To leave Tyne, go to other cities to start again and work hard. If not, who is willing to be driven out in this way, leaving home? If you can, who wouldn't want to leave the wind and go to the next bigger stage to pursue yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How, is there any way?", Foshan handed over a bottle of freshly opened fruit wine. Dooling waved his hand, he didn't drink, or he rarely ate alcohol when it wasn't necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windbreaker was hung on the hanger, the room with yellow walls was slightly dim, and there were some water stains left on the walls and ceiling. This is a temporary rented room that is handled by someone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat down on the sofa that had lost his elasticity, and the buttocks had an intimate contact with the planks under the cushions, and almost his ass blossomed without shock. He put his arms on the armrests and looked like he was lying in the bathtub. He stood up again, rubbed his foot against the sofa, and walked back and forth a few steps before he looked at the Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a way to get close to the mayor’s wife, Mrs. Vivian, and according to my understanding, the mayor has already had a mistress outside, but he is still very Respecting Mrs. Vivian's opinion, this is an opportunity. As long as Mrs. Vivian says a few words, it is more useful than doing anything outside. It is not easy to get on Mrs. Vivian, and you may need to sacrifice... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words have not been finished yet, and all of them raised their hands to stop Du Lin from continuing. He lifted the bottle and slammed it. Tearing the torn collar, taking a deep breath of only half of the cigarettes, eyes slightly reddishly looking at Du Lin, "My father did not know where to go, may be dead on the battlefield, may also be dead Lost, my mother raised our brothers and sisters. She has not been easy in these years. My brother and sister are still young and need someone to take care of them. When I am gone, remember what you said before, I don’t ask you really. Think of my family as your family, but you must take care of them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember to tell them, I love them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say, what do you want me to do, yes To assassinate someone, or do something else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the slightly excited Buddha, Du Lin snorted and then laughed directly. He smiled and felt a little pain in his stomach. Dudu is almost stupid, he looked at Du Lin straight, do not know if he said something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, Du Lin stopped the laughter, but when he saw the stupid expression on the face of the Buddha, he couldn’t help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
