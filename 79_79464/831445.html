			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin came to Otis, the guys in the city hall who were not willing to give up their hard-won work so easily, did not catch up with Du Lin. In their opinion, Doolin may be the same unlucky one, and was pushed out, then transferred to come here waiting for his bow, or voluntarily withdraw. They even have some gloating, after all, the mayor’s position is much more than the directors of them, but the mayor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past imperial period, the title may have been downgraded, but after the new party took office in the new era, it has never been heard of anyone who has relegated, in other words Du Lin transferred to any place, he is also a mayor, the worst is also in place, not a little lower than his current level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say the inferiority of human beings, I also want to do this. I always hope that someone is more unlucky than myself. Only in this way can we get back some fun of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with Du Lin’s 200,000 plus zero cash being locked into the vault, these people look at Doolin’s gaze again. Somewhat different. After all, this is still a world in which people can speak. Being able to get money means development. If there is development, it means more money can be made. Those who have nothing to do all day, in addition to dozing off in the office, are flipping through the newspapers of the past week to find out what is going on outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a society where capital is king. If Du Lin’s friends are willing to support his work, everyone will have a head, in this expectation. Next, Du Lin and they opened a small meeting, taught them a special way of working, such as ... blackmail! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ransom is a life skill that is not easy to master, because attitude is too strong is not extortion, but threatens extortion. If the attitude is too gentle and gentle, it is to eat. So extortion is a very deep study, and Doolin must be able to teach these idiots who have abused limited time in their studies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director of the Transportation Bureau and the tax official of Otis City, that is, the young man named Thomson, a chicken yellow hair looks a bit weird. He listened to Doolin’s words this time and used a little oil to make it much better. He invited Ms. Saili to her office and patiently told her about the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things are a bit difficult!" Thomson seems to be a bit embarrassed. In fact, his heart beats very hard. He has been holding his breath. For fear that his mouth will be wide enough to let Seri hear his heartbeat. "The mayor is still not clear to you. What is transported, so..." He showed a little troublesome expression and shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, I looked up at Sally, and Seriton understood it. She took out a ten-dollar bill and pushed it on the table. past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time someone gave him money, Thomson’s heart was coming out of his throat, watching the ten dollars a bit hot, and at the same time There is also a crash that cannot be described - Mr. Doolin did not teach him how to put the money back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it in the drawer of the table, or put it in your pocket, or directly in your hand? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was hesitating how to put the ten dollars together, Sally thought he was too little, with some ugly smile, and took it again Ten dollars came out and pushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two ten-dollar bills are worth more than half a month’s salary, and he’s thirty-five dollars a month, God is on, Forgive your humble servant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a faint footstep outside the door. Thomson, who has been here for two years, is already familiar with the pace between his peers. This is a stranger. In the footsteps, he immediately used a newspaper placed on his desk to cover the twenty dollars. His original intention is that he does not want others to know that he is in the process of black money, but his action, but also let Seri lay down his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She breathed a sigh of relief, while in the heart secretly these people are crazy, and all the money dare to accept, but also have a look of hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these smugglers, the tax collector who collects money is a good tax official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure flashed through the door, and the strange look stayed on Thomson’s face for a moment. Thomson immediately stood up and closed the door, only to feel a little more peace of mind. He glanced at the newspaper on the table, and the flash of his heart flashed. Is this the money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked back to his seat, and then according to the core rhetoric that Du Lin taught him, he added some content. "You two cars are a bit troublesome, but it is good for us to meet us, otherwise it will really Your things are deducted and destroyed! Be aware that in other places, those people can speak without us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Thomson saying? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true, but it’s not as shocking as he said, it’s the same kind of coercion, sending gifts first, sending envelopes without bullets, or The official responsible for the matter painted a target on the door. They have also encountered places that say they want to destroy, except for a few times, they can basically get the goods back, just spend more and spend less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selly nodded and smiled, "Yes, yes, you are right!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When was Thomson so over? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if these words are just a very simple communication technique, Thomson can feel the benefits of being a tax official. same! He coughed and said: "I know that there are some places in the empire where there are liquor licences. Your wine is not necessarily illegal. Is it right?" He stared at Sally, and Celi stunned. A moment, then nodded quickly, and complimented Thomson a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomson gradually entered the role, he found that these things are not difficult, the key is to be courageous, to be confident, "the profit of these things you have How much? I will say first, if I find that you are lying, this road is very sorry in the future, you can't get through, understand what I mean?", he said his tone became softer again, "I just want to It is not a bad thing to get the tax collected. As long as you pay the tax, these things are legal. Even if you can win a lawsuit in any place, can you understand it?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The empire is for legitimate businessmen or based on protection policies. Only by encouraging business people to circulate goods and funds, the economy can get better!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The cost of this shipment is no more than eight dollars, but they plan to buy twenty-four dollars, which has twice the profit, that is, sixteen dollars. She did not dare to report so much, biting her teeth and reporting a profit of twelve dollars, secretly hiding the profit margin of four dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the profit of these twelve dollars, almost let Thomson ask her if she is willing to let people take a share, too dark, and actually earn a bottle of twelve? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and pressed his mind to the desire to violently spurred by huge profits, took out a pen and wrote and painted on paper, and calculated it. "Ms. Sai Li, according to the imperial law, you must pay no less than 50% of the profits as a special tax on the wine industry, that is, a bottle of six dollars!", after these Thomson hearts again do not live up to expectations Jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard Du Lin say that the carriage can hold 6,000 bottles, although I don’t know why the new Mayor of Doolin is so familiar with these things. Now Tom Thomson thinks that the mayor is right, he can hold 6,000 bottles, which is the special tax of 36,000 pieces! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still two horses on the horse, 72,000 pieces! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His faces are all red with excitement, some worry and some look forward to Sally. After the appearance of Selly's face appeared a brief stunned, she nodded! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These damn smugglers can actually pay out 72,000 to pay taxes, so how much can they earn? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomson was temporarily giving mathematics to his college teacher with excitement. Some of them were difficult to raise their tone a little. "And you evade taxes." The fine, but the mayor has already explained it to me. With your positive attitude and sense of responsibility, we are punished according to 5 percent of the total value. We must know that in normal procedures, the amount of fines starts from 30 percent. Take off, to three hundred percent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5%, which means that each bottle has to take out a dollar, but this The point loss Sally can be the master, she nodded happily again. However, she is not completely nodding, and she also asked a question she was very concerned about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thomson Tax Officer, if I pay a special tax and a fine, I have the tax payment certificate that you gave me, is there no right to detain again after the checkpoint? "Our goods, and ask us for money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomson nodded. "As long as you have other formalities, they have no power to detain your property. There is no power to ask you for any benefit. This is an illegal act. Do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
