			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando laughs a lot, it’s hard to see him angry, even if you fall him, mock him, make him joke, he will keep Smile on the face. Will he show other expressions? Of course, when dealing with people whose status and status is not as good as him, he doesn't laugh very much. It seems that his smile is only "open" to those who are in high society. But people who know him know that sometimes people who face the upper class will show other expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when he wants to go black, or when he feels embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando’s brows are tightly screwed together at this time, to say who is the most wanted person to get rid of in Tener, Du Lin That little thing. He always does not follow the rules, troubles himself, and almost pulls himself down twice. Of course, these are not important. What is important is that he dares to use his family to threaten himself. This is unacceptable to Prando, so he most wants to get rid of Du Lin's "heterogeneous", but he dare not start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he didn’t dare to start was that he couldn’t bear the revenge after the failure. He didn’t have the confidence to solve the Dulin, like a fox, in one go. Let him run away, or let his cadres run away, then Prando will face the revenge of these crazy mad storms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is the head of the regional police station, although he is a member of the maintenance order and the law in the city of Tener, he and the homeless tramps on the street. There is no difference in essence. He is also a person, but also a person. He didn't have the skin to defend the bullets. Without one hand, he could lift the strength of the weapon to carry the platform. An explosion or even a bullet would kill his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he didn’t dare to start with Du Lin, even if he had a perfect plan, he wouldn’t dare to do it in the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin can be a madman, using gambling to decide the future, but he is not a madman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he faces a tough choice, the maid of the mayor’s adult personally sent a note, and the contents of the note on the note made Prando is somewhat unbearable. The mayor asked him to arrest Du Lin and the backbone of the fellowship he led and sent it to prison. The purpose of the mayor’s adult is to tell everyone that the blood of the traitor is the blood of the descendants of Heidele’s traitor. Even if he wears luxurious clothes and lives in a magnificent house, he is still a traitor. Is not a person who is trustworthy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I also want to warn Heidler in this way. Maybe he really has a lot of power and energy, but here is Tener. He doesn't count, the mayor said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that may seem simple to the mayor is that it’s getting too much trouble when it comes to Prando. The first thing to do is whether or not to start with Doolin. This is a tough choice. If he chooses not to do it, he will certainly not offend Du Lin and will not be retaliated by Du Lin and his fellow countrymen, but he will offend the mayor. Obedience tools and disobedient tools can be selected with almost no brains. The mid-term election is just around the corner. At that time, the mayor will only have to say a few greetings, and Prando may have to lose his hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very difficult decision! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a two-pronged way to get through this difficult? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando’s fists smashed and groaned, and his eyes gradually showed a luster of lust. He hammered the table and made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going to see Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned above, he does not like Du Lin, but living in this society, the mature performance is to completely hide his true preferences in the bottom of my heart. Show yourself, you can not like everyone, but you can't let them know that you don't like them, but also pretend that we are good friends, and then choose a secret way when necessary, from behind to you If you don’t like someone, you will feel more comfortable in a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't like Doolin, but in this matter, he needs Doolin's help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He changed his police uniform in the lounge, put on a plainclothes, and then put on a hat to cover most of his appearance. Fortunately, the weather has cooled sharply at this time, and wearing a large windbreaker will not attract attention. He sneaked out from the back door of the police station. He is going to find Du Lin, then tell his own thoughts and give a result that everyone can accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Prando turned around in the city to find Du Lin, it was already seven o'clock in the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karur is not an easy-to-convincing old man, even with Ernst’s companionship, but Du Lin’s hard-working tongue finally made Karul choose to trust him for the time being. For this reason, he also invited the two to have dinner together and spent a hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of smoked Du Lin just got out of the car. A chunky chunky chunky guy wearing a windbreaker and a hat came over the shadow of the road. The cool wind just happened to come. Du Lin was a stunner and pulled out the pistol. I got the guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! It's me! Prando!", Prando quickly took off his hat and revealed his face, Du Lin. He glanced at him and put away his pistol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the next time you still appear, I will be engraved on your tombstone, 'This person died in the evening wearing a windbreaker and a hat!'" The person in the store has opened the store door, and Du Lin walked inside and took off the scarf. "How come you, wear it like this?", if you stare carefully at Du Lin, you can find him walking. The posture is a bit strange, and the twist is not going straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Du Lin can't drink alcohol, or he is not very good at drinking. The wine that Mr. Xerma drank was basically made by Mrs. Kesma with fruits that could not be sold and could not be burned. When the alcohol was low, there was a strange smell of rotten fruit, and the children at home. I don't like to drink, naturally I can't talk about the problem of not drinking. He can't drink, but he still drinks. Dinner is a signal of peace. He needs to drink a little alcohol to set off the atmosphere. The three are not small people. The natural choice is also a high degree of wine. As a result, Du Lin will drink some of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando did not answer his words, Du Lin’s footsteps, and immediately went to the second floor, the two entered the room and the Buddha stayed outside the door. He knew that these two people must have important things to say, so without Du Lin’s instructions, he would not go in and would not let other people in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando threw the note directly to Doolin, and Du Lin blinked his eyes and squinted at the words on the note. A sweat, "Who is this for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides the mayor, the person who can order me is not in this city. More.", Prando sneered, taking a cigarette from the cigarette case on Doolin's desk and ordering it for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin closed his eyes and leaned back. For a moment, he asked: "What are you going to do?", he did not ask you to catch Grab the nonsense of me, since Prando came here and showed him this note, it goes without saying that Prando does not want to conflict with Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando talked about ash. "I have a plan that everyone can accept, but I don't know if you dare to gamble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next Rondo put his plan to Du Lin, but it is not a great plan, but it is an old thing. To put it bluntly, it is bullying. He will pick up Du Lin, grab a few Guarts and identify them as the backbone of the fellowship, then sentence them according to the mayor and send them to the district prison. On the way to the regional prison, he will release Du Lin and replace him with Du Lin to serve his sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor appointed him to complete his mission, and he did not offend Du Lin, and no one was offended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was dumbfounded, wasn’t that the first time Prando gave Córder’s move? The result was eventually destroyed by him, but carefully looking back and thinking about it, this trick is low-level and looks "naive", but it is extremely effective. If it wasn't for Du Lin's desire to kill Gotol, maybe the disaster would have made Prando and Codor do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that makes Doolin feel hesitant is Prando’s real idea, knowing that once he is locked into the regional police station, Doolin’s life is In the hands of Prando, he will lose all initiative. If Prando suddenly turned his face at that time, he would really die in it. But if you don't implement this plan, it means giving up all the business and foundations in the city of Tener, going far away and starting again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not Du Lin’s temperament, he refuses to go to other places, he can rise, he can quickly have today’s status and everything, he must have made a great effort And hardship. More, it is a kind of luck that exists in the dark, and luck makes him have everything in the present. If you go to another place to start again, can you not be able to do it as it is now, the unfamiliar place of life and the congenital exclusion of the local people, maybe he left, he could not accomplish anything in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also possible to create a higher glory, but who can say the standard? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at Prando, and Prando calmly greeted his gaze. "I need to guarantee, Prando, otherwise I will choose other methods. Paul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Doolin’s suspicion and distrust, Prando did not care, and if he was Durin, he would not be easy. Give your own life to someone else's hand, "What do you want me to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
