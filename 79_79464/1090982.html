			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of Carol’s second trip, it’s from the heart that wants to calm the storm, or the old man of the imperial central bank will use the name of the Ministry of Finance to press Du Lin. Dooling could not do anything, it was not his character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You hit me a punch, don’t blame me for slashing you, they want Du Lin to give up, and Doolin goes to dig their roots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this idea is definitely not a time of inspiration, he and Magus have repeatedly talked about the development of the empire, Maggs once said, The uncontrolled central bank of the Empire poses a huge potential threat to the financial economy of the entire country. An uncontrolled central bank is very likely to become a knife for capitalists to trample on law and authority. When the amount of wealth and the control of the underlying society exceeds the upper limit, they will want to seek more things, such as power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many rich people in the past years who have turned into political officials to become officials in certain places. They have far more advantages than ordinary officials. This allows them to quickly expand and expand once they enter the official system of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The simplest example, when a capitalist who hires hundreds of thousands of workers wants to run for election, maybe someone can resist him a little, but when one has a hundred If the capitalists of the 10,000-class workers want to gain power, no one can stop them! Their workers will not hesitate to vote for the employers who have supported them and their families in exchange for the opportunity to continue to work steadily. These capitalists do not even need to spend money to publicize, to speak, to buy people, to be able to vote. Get a great advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you expand this to a higher level, when a consortium with tens of millions of workers working for them suddenly wants to run for election They may be able to defeat the more traditional campaigner officials in the election year and get the majority of the votes in a state. This is terrible! Once a capitalist gains power in this way, all consortia will soon imitate learning and seize the power of a single state. Eventually the cabinet will become a joke and the empire will become "divided." <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is impossible to curb the expansion and expansion of these capitalists through official means, then they can only rely on capital to destroy these people, in the areas they are best at. They solved it and let their "death" warn all capitalists that there is always an insurmountable red line in this country, who will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to do this, you must have your own "central bank". You can stand on the cabinet side without reservation at the crucial moment. Otherwise, it is a joke in the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carol’s second chief smiled twice. “Maybe... I didn’t think about this, maybe it’s a good idea, I’ll go back. After that, I will discuss it with my colleagues." He didn't dare to stay here. Du Lin made him a little out of order, and made him feel strange and horrible. He actually spoke in Du Lin. In the way, in the manner and tone, I feel the same thing as Magus. Understatement sees people sitting on unstable chairs, but they have to let him be led by his words... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more terrifying is that after Du Lin finished this sentence, he also seriously thought about the feasibility, not directly refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awful young people, so far after the first few years, no one is willing to challenge the status of the imperial central bank in the financial economy of the empire. Even the idea will not be, but this guy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin personally sent Carol to the second room and left to return to the study. He glanced at the wire-bound book on the table and sat down. In the sun, think about what kind of motivation you can bring to drive this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the third day after Carol’s return, he called Doolin and told him that the imperial central bank was willing to accept his terms in a Apologize to Du Lin at the reception. Being able to make such a decision means that the current director of the rotation has been under greater pressure. Du Lin once had doubts about Vicki. What role did he play in this? If he takes out the patent certificate, the storm will calm down, but if he does not do this, does it mean that he is another group? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day of receiving the call, Natiya arrived at the Imperial Capital, along with Walter and her daughter, a freshman who was just in the ninth grade. little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of the emperor and the south is so different that their family does not adapt so quickly. When Natiya sees Doolin, Walter takes their daughter to go Go shopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You come very quickly, is the road going well?", Du Lin reached out and Natiya shook hands. "We will leave the empire the day after tomorrow." You may need to talk to your family, and we will be back in the first half of next year at the latest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s trip to the Federation will not actually last long. It will probably end in January and February next year, and then they will have a global trip for two to three months – in fact, fleeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did Du Lin have no one to rob him of his "commander" status and power after he made this huge plan? Because all the participants know that this is not a good job, a group of people have screwed up a country's financial economy. Is this country only acknowledging its own failures and going to face this huge setback? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course no, they will try their best to find this person and then destroy the bastard from the flesh to the spirit in a humanitarian spirit, even if this can’t be chased. Returning losses, making up for everything, at least they can export gas. So Du Lin needs to flee for a while, it can be said to be a tour, and finally return to the empire, as a hero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very dangerous journey, he rarely puts himself in a dangerous situation, but this is another must be completed in his other big plan. Phased tasks. The more thorough understanding of this society, the more Du Lin can feel that even after more than 20 years, the mainstream groups of the society have no good feelings for the Federation, and even hate this country. It is the federation that shames the proud Ogdin people. If the Union of Trade Unions is a powerful, not weaker country, perhaps people can still feel better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federation is nothing but a group of villains formed by a group of treacherous businessmen who are ignorant of the empire. They are actually despicable by a group of people who have never seen it before. The villain was invaded and almost hit the emperor's capital. The feeling of humiliation was lingering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has to do not only to make great profits for himself, but more importantly, he needs to be a "hero", a hero of an era, a country Hero! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people know what he has done, for the empire, what has been done for the mainstream society, people will cheer for him, the girls will fork their legs He waved the handcuffs in his hand, and he will fully integrate into the mainstream of this empire, and people will be proud of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only after reaching this condition, or limitation, his next phased plan can continue to be implemented step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is very long, you can't remember what every second of your life is doing, 90% of all things you have experienced All of the above will be forgotten in the corner of memory, or even completely forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
