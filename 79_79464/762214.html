			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of a person is limited, but after a lot of people, these limited forces are brought together to form a new collective force that far exceeds the individual. the power of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sometimes people will do bad things, for example, if there are too many people being deceived, especially in the case of the gap between the rich and the poor and class problems The more people there are, the more trouble they have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution proposed by the old man effectively saved the loss for everyone. According to the old man’s opinion, everyone paid a little money to redeem the East Coast Entertainment Company, then Slowly managing one day will return to the present. But some people have different opinions on this, such as ... those wealthy rich and celebrities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;550,000 will be a heavy knife for them, but they do have everyone’s responsibility, no need for others A share has this opportunity. So the new disagreement has emerged. In the end, it is the collective redemption of this East Coast entertainment company. Who will give it to anyone who has money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this issue of personal interest, what class gap, what rich and poor are not a problem, everyone is back to the original During the quarreling period, when the only proposal that could solve the current predicament was to abort, Du Lin, who had been sitting in the corner, spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. 350,000 is still a little face in Irian. It is not Du Lin, but the money in his hands, so when Du Lin stands up When we reached the front of the crowd, everyone stopped a pointless quarrel and projected their eyes on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and succumbed. "Why don't we solve the problem by auction? Who pays more, who is East Coast Entertainment?" ......", watching people quarrel again, Du Lin raised his hand and pressed twice. "Listen to me, guys, I know what you want to say, nothing more than that some of us have more wealth than The sum of the wealth of some people, but it is not a problem for me to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, financial resources can be united, three or five people or ten When the individual is united, one person takes out 50,000 yuan and exceeds 500,000. It is not necessarily that there is no hope of obtaining the equity of East Coast Entertainment. Secondly, the part of more than 550,000 I think should be based on the proportion of losses. Assigned to everyone who has not succeeded in the auction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What I want to say is that any investment is risky. It is not that after you put the money into East Coast Entertainment, the company will be able to make big money. They may lose money or even go bankrupt. At that time, you are as bloody. Now we assume that the risk has been maximized. You may have read the newspaper recently. The newspaper giant George from the Imperial City has to build 20 to 30 theaters in Ilyan, and they are in the best position. On the other hand, the prospects of East Coast Entertainment are very bleak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this case, you can avoid the danger of being innocent because of the bankruptcy of East Coast Entertainment. Even if you can recover some of the money, why should you refuse? You can refuse this method. In fact, for me personally, for Mr. Juan...", Du Lin nodded slightly and people noticed that they stood at the end. A row of Juan suddenly took a sigh of relief. "We can afford these losses, but what about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words made everyone silent, and investment is indeed risky. People who can sit here are naturally not the first to invest, and the first investment can’t bring so much money. . Everyone is a victim, they just want to save their losses. Dooling’s words undoubtedly pointed them to a solution that would solve the current predicament, that is, unite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial resources of each of them are limited, but the financial resources that are brought together may not be as good as these tycoons. The tycoons are really rich, and they are millions of tens of millions, but can they really come up with the money? impossible! Because when calculating their wealth, their real estate and intangible assets are included in the total wealth. They have other businesses to do, and other projects to invest, it is impossible to repeat a large sum of money in a very short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More... Some of them have already thought of another way, which is to save their losses as much as possible by raising the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent people are constantly looking for objects that they can cooperate with, and Juan smiles at Du Lin. He knows that this is a good way to solve the current dispute. Even if he is Juan, he can't hold all the opponents, and he must have a plan that everyone agrees with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communication of eyes seems to be more powerful than the language, and soon these people have a unified opinion, and the auction will be held three days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Juan left, he was alone. Cullen waited for him downstairs. After getting into the car, Juan closed his eyes and thought for a moment before he smiled and said: "Du Lin’s ambition is not small, no matter what means he has, This is when I paid a tuition fee.", he said that he couldn't help but sigh. "The young people are really amazing now, they are much smarter than I was at that time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coulomb did not understand what the father was saying, and Juan did not explain it to him. In fact, he has already had a bit of speculation in his heart. Eric’s disappearance will have any direct and indirect relationship with Doolin, and the basis for this speculation is that he took out one million and bought all the shares of Eric directly. . He did have a little thought at the time, according to Du Lin's ideas, East Coast Entertainment will be a stepping stone to the George family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This company’s share of equity is indirectly equal to telling the George family who is the real principal, and Juan wants to raise himself in this matter. In the position, I pressed Du Lin. It’s a bit stupid to look at it now, so he has to pay a million tuition for this. It’s definitely impossible to say no pain, but at the same time he feels that he is actually a good thing for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is smarter and more savvy, and the chances of problems in working with the George family are smaller. He wants to be a partner with the George family. Doesn't Dolin want to? He obviously also thinks very much. Under the premise that there is no conflict between the interests of both parties, the unanimity of interests is the most stable bond between the two sides. Even if Du Lin is going to have problems, it is after successful cooperation. At that time, everyone began to fight for power, and it would be fine to find a way to kick Du Lin out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan doesn’t think that he is worse than Du Lin. This is just the result of his greed for a while. He has already guessed the purpose of Doolin, that is, equilibrium. The share of equity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin used this opportunity to push other people together to fight against him, whether it was the loss of one million in the front or the next plan, he It is impossible for another person to make a large sum of money. With the reminder of this matter, the two of them will cooperate to share the shares of East Coast Entertainment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a great young man, regardless of whether Eric’s escape is arranged by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sighing, glanced at the eldest son sitting in the front co-pilot position, Juan was even more worried. He understands that there are always some shining people in every stage of the era that can't be seen directly in this world. Compared with the little guys like Du Lin, these children in their family have a good feeling in addition to their high self. Nothing is right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan often rethinks this question. Is it true that these years have been accustomed to the wind, so they don’t even know that people are not arguing with them. They just look at their faces and let them go. Maybe it’s time for them to go out and take a trip. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you can't be a person who surpasses yourself in the future, you should at least take this family business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan’s thoughts were quickly disrupted by the sound of an ambulance. He turned back and smiled and shook his head. Let these jerkes Leave yourself, go to a faraway place, no one knows them, no one knows where they are, from scratch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ambulance that passed by Juan’s car one second ago, Brown’s expression was distorted to give a feeling of embarrassment, the doctor had put him Fixed on the stretcher, carefully cleaning the calf with obvious distortion on his left side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just at the time of the scene, according to the settings in the script, he should lie in a chair and bask in the sun to set off his chic and unscrupulous. But what I didn't expect was that a car suddenly lost control and ran into the street light, and the street light fell directly toward him. His reaction has quickly escaped, but the calf is still smashed and fractured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole crew panicked, and the broken leg of the male lead meant that the show was ready for at least two months. A lot of things can happen in two months. It’s a bit of a use of the rich man behind Corinna for a short time, but there is always someone who doesn’t buy it for a long time. Once the first color film's gimmicks were taken away by others, it can be said that even if they filmed the most perfect Ilyan holiday, they all failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corinna looked at her on the stretcher and looked filled with desperate and struggling Brown. She liked the actor Brown, and she didn’t say enough. Still very humorous and considerate, they have rolled over the sheets. I can think of myself to wait for two months for this idiot, and maybe miss the most important page in the history of the first color film, Corinna's expression is sensational. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brown, you quit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Corinna in the ambulance It's very light, but it falls like a thunder in the director's and producer's ears, and even Brown forgets the struggle for not being able to endure the pain. He raised his body slightly, his eyes filled with incredulous eyes. "What did you say? Let me quit?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
