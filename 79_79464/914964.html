			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry is a big aristocrat, and there are many industries in the family, but he is a little different from the aristocrats who formed the consortium like the Cape family, because he himself It is the high-level party, and the old aristocrats who have been “overthrown” by the New Party are not waiting to see this younger generation. No one wants to play the game of capital with his family. So relatively speaking, his thickness in cash flow is not as good as that of Cape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why the nobility within the New Party does not form a consortium... this issue is complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he needs the support of the Northern Consortium, so he needs to get the friendship of these capitalists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After experiencing the mid-term general election, he spent a lot of money on this, although the family’s account still has a lot of money, but these funds are family business turnover. When needed. To put it simply, he doesn't have much cash in his hands, which gives the city's merchants a chance to give him gifts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annoying guy quickly left the fun, and it’s not difficult for Harry to say that it’s very easy to do. The other party wants to buy a piece of land in Leeds that has not been developed and is abandoned. This open space has been vacant for several years and is an injury to the city itself. When there were foreign tourists coming to Leeds, surrounded by beautiful high-rise buildings, suddenly a garbage dump appeared in the city, which had a negative effect on the image of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the original real estate developers were unwilling to develop, they changed people to develop. How much did they spend on the land, and now they return the money? They are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether or not the interests of others will be harmed in the process, it is not important that the interests of individuals or a small group of people will never be equal to the interests of the entire city. It is important that even if it is damaged, it should be bravely undertaken. This is what Lizhua citizens should do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was lightly closed, and Harry took the suitcase around and lifted the suitcase. It was a bit heavy and there was a lot of money in it. He didn't know how much the guy had given him, but it shouldn't be less. Asking the governor to pay for the horse is much more expensive than asking the mayor to pay for it. He smiled a little self-deprecatingly. If it wasn't for Doolin's federal plan and this mid-term election, he didn't have much cash in his hands. He couldn't let such a person go to his office and send them to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a self-destructive behavior. Even if he really wants to collect money, he will accept those big capitalists instead of such a small businessman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the box on the table with his hand on the table, then opened the password lock, and a flash of gold flashed from his face. In addition to the thick layer of banknotes neatly stacked in the box, there is a gold bar with a child's arms. The golden gold bars are quietly lying in a red flannel, and the surface is filled with intoxicating luster. Even Harry, who is used to big numbers like this, has a slight loss of time in the face of this box of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money on paper is always just a number, far from the shock of the money. He picked up a banknote, and the scent of the ink was never so fascinating. The ribbon of the Imperial Bank was wrapped in it, with two layers. Each floor is two rows of five cymbals, and the upper and lower layers add up to almost 200,000. With this piece of gold brick, he took it in his hand, no less than 300,000, which is 500,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry suddenly had a bit of a slap in the face. He didn’t know much about the land. He only knew that when the middleman contacted him, he said “a piece of land”. Where is it, he is not at all clear. He realized that the money might not be so easy to put in the pocket. When a person is willing to buy an opportunity with 500,000, it shows that the benefits brought by this opportunity are far more than 500,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He re-closed the box, walked into the rest room and put it in the safe, then let him press the button on the edge of the table, the secretary quickly Just push the door in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember that Leeds has a vacant lot for a long time without anyone developing, isn't it?", he did not say too specific, purely a habit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary nodded. "There is a piece of land in the northeast corner of the intersection of Lizhua 17th Street and Aile Avenue. It is said that the real estate developer did not raise it. The funds could not be started.” The secretary quickly answered Harry’s question. The state government was established in the suburbs of Leeds, and the city center was unable to find a place to house the state office building and some supporting facilities. In the suburbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary paused for a while, then said something about the land, far more than Harry’s understanding of the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This land was originally known as the landlord of Leeds, and Leeds is the capital of a state closest to the capital, only three hundred miles from the imperial capital. Seventeen kilometers, with a very large development potential. The site is close to the city center, the location is very good, the popularity is very strong, the auction sold a price of 8.95 million, at the time was the most expensive site in Leeds, no one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have high hopes for the projects developed on this land, and think that this is definitely a very profitable project. Real estate developers have also shown their ambitions. They have made a very gorgeous plan to raise funds for the society. Development, and promised rebate will not be lower than 20% per annum. If investors are not willing to pay back, after the end of the project period, they will find an equivalent shop or house for investors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promise of such boldness and the visible future make many people very interested in this, and their plans are very beautiful, even Leeds City’s City Hall took the initiative to stand up for their endorsements, which caused a very sensational scene at the time – many middle-class people waved their banknotes in hopes of “shares”, and the Empire Daily used a phrase “people are crazy” to describe the time. scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But later, due to the divestment of the partners and some other things, the development was dragged down. It has been six years now, and there is no movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people say that the real estate agent has ran away with money, but the official did not express his position. The reason for not expressing his position is that there is not only the money of the imperial central bank but also the municipality. Part of the investment in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public, and private. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor wanted to take this opportunity to get a little more "own money" for the city hall after he approved the land, and wanted to increase the thickness of the small vault. At the same time, some officials and staff also thought that this was an excellent investment, so they all joined the plan. In addition, there are 8 million banks in the market. The land was mortgaged immediately after being photographed by real estate developers. They claimed that they needed a lot of cash to build as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city hall was deceived, the bank was deceived, a large number of middle classes were deceived, and many innocent people were greatly lost in profit and difficult to handle properly. The situation made the land so that the land was now abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean by saying that this is a scam, because it involves the City Hall and the Imperial Bank, so no one dares to move that land?" Pere heard the secretary carefully tell him the inside story of the land. The roots were a bit sour and at the same time relieved. If it was a liar, it would be best to take it back to fill the losses of the bank and the city hall. No one would think that he "operated". As for the lawsuit... That is not what Harry needs to worry about. If the other party sues the state government, it is a good thing, indicating that the other party is not a liar. When the time comes, the other party is given a deadline to operate the land. If it is not, it will be recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
