			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s rules are the rules of the city, no one is allowed, nor can it shake the rules here. Whether you are a royal family or an ordinary businessman, there is no room for bargaining in principle. Even if they use their connections to pressure Du Lin to bow, Du Lin will not give up his principles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Ornes was still planning to say something, Solo raised his hand to stop him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo’s face did not show any dissatisfaction, but instead smiled, it seems that Du Lin’s refusal did not affect his slightest mood, “Du Mr. Lin, I can understand that every official has his own political ambitions and governance philosophy. I admire all those who have dreams and persistence. But the society we need to face is not our ideal society. Sometimes we I have to go against my own mind to do something that I am not willing to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This does not mean that you have forsaken your own insistence, this is just a kind of Adaptation, a kind of work that needs to be done in the pursuit of the ultimate ideal. As Ornes said, there is no big consortium in the city of Otis. Some people are still watching, and a guide is needed here. It can bring not only a large amount of cash investment, but also a clustering effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When many consortia and big capitalists gather here, Even if you don't have any The city's development plan, we will also help you turn this city into a city beyond your imagination. I have this ability and confidence, just need us to communicate some problems between us."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, Mr. Doolin, can you tell me what is blocking our opinion? I think that with the efforts of both of us, we may be able to overcome this problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin squinted for a moment before he raised his head and said, "Mr. Soro, thank you very much for your understanding, if you don't ask for a complete power." The casino business license is willing to cross-share with other people. I will definitely welcome the presence of the hymn consortium with both hands. But if you want a complete license, please forgive me for being rude, that is impossible. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo has been watching Du Lin with a smile, and did not interrupt him, and occasionally nodded that he had already heard. He did give Du Lin quite good feelings. Without Du Lin's imaginary arrogance, there was no way to think of what they proposed, and Du Lin would have to complete it, so Du Lin would continue to talk to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“When I came here, it was just a deserted city, so I set the current development plan for the city. These plans mean the formation of rules. If I break my rules personally, it will only cause more and more. Troublesome problem. Here, in my city, my principle is the rule here, and I am not going to break it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo smiles Nodded: "I can understand your thoughts. So, between our differences, is there a way that both of us can accept? For example, we can not have a complete gambling card, but we have more than two casinos. Absolute control, what do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible, Mr. Soro, my position can not be shaken!", Du Lin said that the smashing, which makes Soro realized that his task of scrambling could not be completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo sighed and shook his head and stood up, and reached out. "I am very sorry that we have no way to reach our intentions. Maybe we still have a chance. Other aspects of cooperation, what do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin reached out and shook his hand. "I believe this is for sure!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we will leave, we will leave by steam locomotive at night, we have to find a place to rest and take a look at the city."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I send you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the town hall, Solo looked back and looked at the back of Du Lin’s turn and shook his head. He turned to look at Ornes. "I remember you said that they have elected their successor?" Ornes nodded and said that this was not a secret inside the New Party. After Du Lin left. Donald will take over his job and become the mayor of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By convention, the importance and particularity of the city does not take Donald’s successor, but the one behind him has That relationship is almost completely exhausted. It can be said that he used his future "potential" to change the chance of gambling. In addition, after the city of Otis became a special zone, it needed a “wading person” to see if the pool was so deep, and then Donald, who had no follow-up power, became a good candidate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He successfully controlled the city, and he could be sent to another place after two years of general election. If he can't control the city, he can send him to other places in two years. He is a touchstone. The time to succeed here is only two years. Regardless of the outcome, the person who ultimately enjoys the fruits of victory is not him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point Donald actually knows himself well, but he doesn't care. Bo, a mayor brings more meaning to the family than anything else. He is willing to gamble once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Donald? Very good, let's contact this future new mayor." Soro doesn't seem to be a Dulin, but actually He is very upset. At this point, when the heirs are fighting for the most crucial moment of inheritance, any slight change may make any heirs do their best. He failed, but his cousin's cousins ​​succeeded, no matter how difficult they were, he lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ornes immediately understood what Soro meant. He called Donald and arranged for more people to come over. They needed a little change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donald is still looking through some of the documents in Otis, the phone ringing on his desk rang and scared him. He blinked and raised his phone in his ear, his expression a little different. He quickly hangs up the phone, simply tidy up and left the town hall, and in a restaurant not far away, he saw the person who just called him - Ornes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, please come out during your working hours, I hope you can understand." Ornes first apologized for his actions, then Ask him to sit down and introduce Mr. Soro to him. "This is the leader of the generation of the Cape family, Mr. Soro." For the guy of Donald's small aristocratic origin, Ornes does not need to introduce more. Many things, as long as the name of Cape is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Donald, who had already sat down, stood up again and expressed his respect for the surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big family like the Cape family can make him fall, so he has no money at all in front of Solo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorro pressed his hand with a smile, let him sit down and nod his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know that the city of Otis is about to build seven casinos?", when Ernes’s words were finished, Donald nodded and admitted that he knew it. At the same time, I am also thinking about the purpose of asking them to come. Ernes continues: "We are going to take one of the gambling cards, which requires your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?", Donald looked at Ornes with amazement. "I may not be able to help you with this incident, because it was Dulin personally caught, I can't intervene in it. And I heard that Du Lin is not going to give anyone a complete casino. He divides each casino into twenty, and even he himself follows it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Ernes smiled and explained: "No, I don't mean to convince Mr. Doolin to agree with our request, but to help us persuade Mr. Doolin when necessary."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Europe just called to return to the family and told the owner Du Lin's attitude, because they will leave here at night, so there is no way to continue to negotiate with Doolin and can only be handed over to other delegations. It seems to them that this is simply a matter of hand, no one will object to such a good thing - this is indeed a good thing, a premium license and willing to continue to invest in the city, this is what all city halls want Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many consortiums invest in an industry or sector of a city, say millions of tens of millions, in fact, this is a "total investment", specific to reality They will divide this total investment into many periods, each with only a small amount of money, and not necessarily all of them are cash investments. As for whether or not you can really put the expected total investment into the end, that is another thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin actually refused their kindness, and Soro’s face was kept his manner and decent, but his heart was not very happy. He has called Harry and he will visit Harry personally when necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry is also behind the northern consortium, and has a good relationship and connection with the hymn consortium, if there is Harry as pressure, plus others knocking around the drums around Doolin When Du Lin feels that he may not be able to hold back this pressure, he may compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a country mud dog leg. There are a lot of things he can’t resist, even if his resume is full of legends, it’s still not an opponent of the old aristocrats. The northern nobility has accumulated hundreds of years of experience, how could it be lost to a mud dog leg? Donald looked at Solo, and Solo nodded slightly, but there was no indication that Ornes continued, "Some changes will happen soon. We need your help, of course, in return, when you need us to lend a helping hand, we will also pull you, this is a commitment from the Cape family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
