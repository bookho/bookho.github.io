			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joshua suddenly opened his eyes in confusion, and he felt the airflow stroking his cheek. He didn't have the experience of living by the sea, so this sea breeze with a sea scent made him feel a little discomfort. The wet air and the salty smell in the air do not exist in the emperor's emperor. The emperor is very dry all year round, but it is much more comfortable to live in than the living environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blinked his eyes, the lights were lit outside the window, the room was dark, and there was a window that didn’t seem to be tight, missing a gap, yarn The curtain is dancing with the wind. He comforted with a sigh of relief. It was so comfortable to sleep. He walked barefoot to the window and heard footsteps. He glanced at the probe and there was a team of security patrols just outside the courtyard wall. Walked through his door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the purchase of this set of 180,000 stars in Florigos, replaced by the federal currency is about 600,000 villas, except here is close When the sea is necessary, you can take a boat and leave quickly. You can also take care of the preservation measures here. It is not unreasonable that the Tianpingshan villa area is known as the most affluent rich area. There will be a routine patrol every ten minutes, and any owner who receives a red button that is often visible in the villa will be able to reach the villa within three minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been six years since the construction of the Tianpingshan villa area has been completed. There has not been any negative news, which is the value of 180,000 stars. Where! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and retracted his head, closed the window, and turned on the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villa is not too big, it is not too small, there are more than 800 square meters on the upper and lower floors, there are separate yards and swimming pools, and there is a room behind the house. court. Although the price is a bit high, Joshua feels very cost-effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs a shower now, directly removes his clothes and walks into the bathroom on the first floor. The hot water supplied 24 hours a day. Don't worry about the need to wait for the bath at this time. He soon immersed himself in warm water, and his body was completely relaxed. He was thinking about how he would enjoy his life in the future. People take great risks to do something, isn't it just to get enough rewards? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps he should find a hostess for this villa, maybe two can, if they can get along well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua, who dreamed of a wonderful life for the future, soon had some sleepiness. When he was about to get up from the bathtub, he vaguely saw another shadow reflected on the mirror of his glass bathroom. He instantly became frightened and struggled to get up from the bathtub, but the bathtub with the special technology of the latest technology was not as easy to use as he thought, at least he wanted to stand up and need both hands, and The bathtub is very slippery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thin steel Soller lived in his neck and forced him up, in a panic he lost his cool, crazy buckled steel Suo wanted to breathe a fresh air, and when his consciousness gradually blurred, he heard a familiar voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dulinto I tell you that you are too close!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the book was motionless, Ellis was relieved. He wore some dirt shoes and stepped on the shiny mirror-like floor and walked to the bar. He opened a bottle of red wine that he didn't know, opened the storage cabinet, took out a pot of fresh fruit from it, and ate it with a little song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the third day the villa’s cleaning staff came here to clean the house for a living, they smelled a stinking smell outside the house, then she Alarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murder case in the rich area immediately caught the attention of the local police station. Whether in the empire or the federation, all things that are related to the rich are not no big deal. Soon they figured out the identity of Joshua, and then they chose to hide the truth of the matter. If they tell people that there has been a murder in the Tianpingshan villa area, these rich people may leave here or even leave the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich who can live here are not as simple as ordinary money, maybe a few people just have money, but more people not only have money, but also Have status and power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they made up a lie, the new guest came from the backward empire because he wanted to stand up during the bath, but because of the bathtub It was so slippery that I accidentally fell and hit my head and was immersed in the bathtub. All this was an accident. Whether people believe that they don't believe this answer, the management company in the Tianpingshan villa district soon took the bathtub manufacturer to court and replaced the bathtub for all the residents... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellis, who had not found the "briefcase" in the federal transcript, had already boarded a cruise back to Irian, and he might not understand what was happening at Ilyan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The George family delegation has begun a second round of negotiations with Juan. The core of the negotiations revolves around the fierce debate on how much power the two sides occupy. Juan’s request is no less than 30%, but the George family believes that the theaters and industries in the hands of Juan can only give him a power of eight percent. If there are differences, it will be impossible to talk about it. Juan can even feel that the George family does not really want to cooperate with them. This time, their so-called negotiations are more like a "finding" of resources in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that’s the feeling. They always ask Juan to show the materials and operations related to the cinemas in his hands and record them, which makes Juan’s heart It started to be a bit flustered because it was not the same as what Du Lin originally said to him! Fortunately, he mastered a fatal news of the George family, although he did not feel very good, but he did not show it. In such a quarrel, the George family’s delegation proposed another way. Instead of forming a unified company, they each operated their own company and formed an alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every important thing must be decided by the board of directors, and the board of directors has five directors and twelve directors. Among them, Juan can serve as the chairman of the board of directors, but Luke and the farm couple can only serve as directors. The meeting is conducted by voting. The director has one vote, the chairman has two votes, and the three directors have the joint name. veto power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such a proposal, Juan could not agree. If he did, then he would not even have 8 percent of the power, so the negotiations were in a deadlock. The two sides are not happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negotiations are actually like this, as much as possible to seek common ground while reserving differences, which is why often an important commercial negotiation may last for a week or even a month, too much Things need to be "coordinated." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a disappointing negotiation meeting, Juan and Luke left the hotel in the same car, and Luke showed some on his face after getting on the bus. Worried, the high-intensity negotiations in these days have never allowed the two sides to have a result that everyone agrees. The George family’s delegation has given him a strong and aggressive feeling. There is also a taste that cannot be said, just like ... don't want to cooperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Huan, do you say that we can succeed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Luke’s full of worries, Juan is very confident, "Of course, we "It will definitely be successful!" He seems to think that this is not convincing enough to explain the source of his self-confidence. "You may not be very clear. Some time ago, a company called DreamWorks announced that it would block the George family in the field of cinema. The layout, and come up with a feasible plan, successfully absorbed a lot of money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Once this dream factory began to speed up the construction, right The George family is definitely a heavy blow. They have invested a lot of money in the early stage. If they can't complete the target, those who are headed by Arthur George will be unlucky. So as long as we can stick to the bottom line. If you want to work with the George family, you must collect it. If you want to work with the George family, you will definitely have to retreat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George family Information and intelligence, while they might exist opponents should have a certain understanding. If the previous investment made Juan unable to retreat, then the emergence of this DreamWorks company pointed out the right direction for him. The company has made a large investment by issuing stocks. It is said that there are tens of millions of them, which is a huge threat to the George family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can't complete your strategic goals before DreamWorks completes their industry layout, then the George family's plan will be a complete failure. Those people, like Juan, have no retreat. The only question now is who can hold on to the negotiating table for a longer time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing that Juan explained that Luke had finally let go of his heart, and at the same time, there was a hint of sorrow in the heart of Juan. Such an important news, he did not tell himself and concealed, this is a betrayal of his own trust. Only now that he is in a weak position, he dare not show any move that he does not return. He is waiting, waiting for the dust to settle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next negotiation is in an endless tug-of-war. The two sides try their best to compete for more power for themselves after the decimal point. Just when Juan thought that the dawn of victory was about to come, the accident happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, he carried Luke to the hotel’s conference hall and planned to continue spending the day, just as he entered the conference room, immediately I noticed that the atmosphere was a little abnormal. The eyes of those people in the delegation have lost the dignity of the previous days, and they all have a feeling of emotion that makes him angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
