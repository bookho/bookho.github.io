			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the annual meeting of the Cape family, the body of the old master is getting worse and worse, and his face is dark enough to absorb light. For the nobility, the annual meeting is a family event. Except for a small number of expatriate family members who cannot return, all those who can return must come back. This annual meeting is not only a summary of the past year, but also a problem of profit distribution in the new year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the annual meeting of Soro could not be late, he returned to the family early every time, and then he might compete for himself at the annual meeting. More bonuses. But this time, he didn't come back. Not only did he not come back to Ernest, he didn't come back. He didn't even have a short message. This made people feel a bad guess. He didn't have anything. The most important thing to do when he left the family to go out was that the eyes of the owner fell on two other heirs who came back early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be aware of this gaze, the two heirs are very generous to respond with a smile, no matter what happened to Soro, as long as they have nothing to do with it, that is Good thing. The three heirs became two heirs, and the chances of having the opportunity to become the owners of such a huge family were much greater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual meeting is a whole day. The main reason for this long delay is the distribution of dividends next year. After one year, some people are doing well, some people are not doing well, then the dividends they receive in the second year will change, a little more, or less. It seems that such fluctuations are in units of one thousandth, and the entire Cape family can be seen. This one thousandth is also an amazing wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the annual meeting of noisy brains, about 10 o'clock in the evening, the Governor of Woodland called Mr. Cape and asked if there was About him and the deal with Soro. He valued the deal very much, and as long as he was able to get the position of vice chairman of the New Party Committee, the last and most stubborn threshold in his political career would have passed. Otherwise, he can only turn around at the current level. When he is almost retired, he will be given a more senior position for half a year. It is the final affirmation of his political career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone was short-lived, and both parties got what they wanted. Mr. Cape hanged up and sat down on the table and supported it with one hand. His chin. The Governor of Woodland’s governor said that Soro had returned to the North and that Soro had not returned, so he must have been on the road. The credit he was able to talk to the governor of Woodland was enough to bring him closer to his position, but he disappeared and something must have happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Mr. Cape called Soro’s wife and asked if she knew Solo’s whereabouts. When he learned from Solo’s wife that Solo’s whereabouts had been investigated, the old gentleman immediately understood everything. Luo may have an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A constant call was made, and another call came in. At about 12 o'clock, Mr. Cape hanged his phone in a dignified manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who investigated Soro’s whereabouts may be a person of Doolin, and the person who assassinated Soro is also a person of Doolin, the investigation bureau of Woodland’s side A very important message, Solo encountered an assassination in the local area, when he was safe, then he returned to the north by boat. The local investigation bureau provided the ticket stub for the ticket. At the time of the destination check-in, the employee saw Solo and Ernest disembark, but then they disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with the previous information, it is very likely that they are finished, and it is Du Lin’s hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Mr. Cape feel that there was a grotesque that could not be said. At that time, Soro intended to use the assassination method to solve Du Lin, so that the family could take the opportunity. Hand into the city of Otis, master one of the casinos or more business, to clean them and make money by smuggling. The assassination failed, which also made the Cape family become passive in Magus. Then there were some minor problems on both sides. For example, Du Lin never let go and refuted his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But all this has been solved under the compromise of Magus, why does Doolin have to do with Soro? Was it because he had never been released in his hatred, or because... Soro went to provoke him again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a very troublesome thing. I’ve seen Du Lin’s tough Mr. Cape doesn’t think that blind war is the best choice now, the family’s focus should be It is not wasted on this private contradiction in the construction of the new special zone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as Dulin considered, the disappearance does not necessarily mean death, even if the specific circumstances of Soro are not fixed, even if Mr. Cape knows Du Lin arranged for the assassination of Solo and succeeded. He did not use this matter to question Du Lin with a bright and honest question because he had no evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people at Woodland have not recruited Doolin until now, so it is difficult to involve this with Du Lin. And, what if Soro is fine? After a while, he suddenly smashed out. Before that, the family had already fought with Du Lin. So how did it end? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;headache! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Cape only hopes to get his position out early, he doesn't want to hurt himself for these things, he wants to live a few more years. He sighed and stood up, and it was not early. It was time to rest. He was not a young self, and he had the courage to say no to the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Mr. Cape did not say anything like that, nothing was said, it is not the time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, Doolin is also actively preparing for the New Year, and the year is about to pass, and he will do it in the year to come. A lot of things, such as the process of Otis, such as turning the city into a human world, has achieved huge profits and satisfied all the passengers here to seek change. First arrange the token company to put the tokens in the hands of all investors, and then arrange two banquets so that everyone can celebrate the last day together. At the same time, he also invited a famous Xie Lisi Street manager from the Imperial Capital to discuss the “packaging” of the entire city. Being able to travel on the last day of the year, in addition to professionalism, Du Lin's project may be an opportunity for the manager to change his own destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Doolin, your thoughts are very...", the manager named Heralds searched the brain for a moment before he found Out of the word "magic", "Yes, very magical. From the day when Xie Lisi Street was born, no, from the day the stock was born, no one thought about turning a city into a huge project. Listing. And your city has great potential and will certainly attract the attention of many investors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we are also facing some problems, first of all, will the empire Supporting such behavior, after all, this is counterintuitive. The second question, if the city of Otis is listed, then where does the investor's income come from, does it have a long-term profit guarantee? The third question, now you are the mayor, I can run this project. I believe that you will not stop at the mayor. In the future, you will be the governor or even the cabinet. How can you ensure that your mayor will continue to implement your policy and principles?" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Once your successor believes that the negative impact of the investment on the market and the damage to the city is greater than the benefits of the harvest, what should I do if I choose to withdraw from the market? How to guarantee investors? The interests?", he is very serious, this is indeed a big plan worth joining, as long as he succeeds, he will become one of the most successful managers of Xie Lisi Street, and will be included in the textbook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
