			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200,000 is not a small amount, even if there is a large box of cash, and it is not convenient to carry, it is not safe. So this time, Du Lin brought a bank draft, and the Imperial Central Bank’s 200,000 yuan promissory note is very funny. Du Lin robbed the money and gold of the Imperial Central Bank, and then the money that was robbed and the money for selling gold existed in the Imperial Central Bank. In order to ensure the safety of Du Lin’s money, the bank also added 20 people. Four hours of uninterrupted guarding the pile of eye-catching banknotes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an interesting reincarnation. The money went around and returned to the original point. The only difference was that the owner of the money changed its name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East Coast Entertainment’s address is in the third district, the only first district of the Imperial Central Bank’s Irian branch, and the interval between the two allows Du Lin to wait for a while. It wasn't until about twenty minutes later that Eric slammed into the door and gave Du Lin a big hug when the short "meal" ended. Dooling did not hesitate to sign his name on the agreement. He looked at Eric with a smile and smiled. Eric touched his cheek without knowing it, touched his beard, and found nothing to doubt. Tuni's agreement was taught to Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, he has set aside nearly one million dollars into this small company, he needs to thank the so-called Xie Lisi Street Investment Consultant and The 500 pieces that I paid for it were exactly the article, so this time his public offering was only going so smoothly. If he can successfully put in another rich man who intends to come in full, he will have about 1.2 million in cash. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to his intention to mortgage the cinema building and the land to the bank, and the value of the company itself, it is possible to escape from the bank by about 500,000. This is one hundred and seven hundred thousand. One hundred and seven hundred thousand, this is much more than he and his companions have done for so many years! It is no wonder that the tycoons on the streets of Xie Lisi are disregarding the industry, and the financial games are indeed much safer than the industrial ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric intends to continue this method, and his companions have gone to the capital of another state to start the enclosure. The money will be the starting capital for the local cause, and this time they play bigger and have a much better approach, much better than what they are doing now. If there is no accident, the one hundred and seven hundred thousand in the hands will return to 3.4 million, or even five or six million or even more in half a year! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Du Lin's eyes with a kind of banter. These young rich people are really good at deceiving. They don't even know to do a preliminary investigation. They made a hasty decision when they watched the agreement for a few days at home. . Of course, Eric will not feel any regrets or apologies for those who have been deceived by him. This is the world. If you don't take the wealth of others, others will come to seize your wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their other good friend, the founder of East Coast Entertainment, was polarized by a third-rate little star and had committed suicide in the field not long ago. Eric didn't want to be such a person, he was a hunter, not a prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be a dinner after the update of our cinema equipment, I hope that you can participate as a shareholder, which is a good opportunity for us to promote you to others!", Eric has thrown his rhetoric again. Many people have eaten this set and become a celebrity. The decent upper class is almost the goal of all the middle and lower classes in the world to fight for life. Now they have taken out the money and got it. Commitment, of course, hope can be rewarded, and Eric is taking advantage of people's psychology to make them feel deceived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, there is one more thing..." Eric watched Du Lin throwing a cigarette on his mouth, some accidents, he I thought that this gentle and young man should not be bad at learning, but soon he was relieved. How many children of rich families do not learn bad? They are crazy at this time, let alone smoke, even if you are fascinated with anesthesia, it is normal. He asked Lilith to bring an ashtray for Du Lin, and then continued: "You should know that there are three founders of this company. We are very good friends, more like brothers than brothers. But because of one We are embarrassed by the woman's watch, you can't believe that the feelings of decades are so fragile in front of a woman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My friend heard In this news, he does not want me to sell this company that embodies the hearts of the three of us and hopes for it. I don't want his ideals to be tarnished, so I hope that you can not publicly announce the things you have already invested in, let us After the equipment update of the theater was announced, what do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin gently nodded his head, which is what he hoped. If Eric and the East Coast Entertainment Company are the news of the swindlers, how can he possibly eat more "dividends"? Sure enough, it is difficult to make a legitimate business to make money, or to make these black and black voices come quickly. He estimated that he could start a business with more than a million dollars and get a company. This is much faster than doing other legitimate businesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two shook hands, Eric expressed his gratitude to Du Lin for understanding his intentions. After congratulating Du Lin on leaving the house that he was swallowing, he returned to the company and squatted. Lilith hangs a sign of the company outside the company's door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Prepare, the things that have been lost are lost. The house is left unused, and it will be empty there. It will appreciate in the future. When we are almost the same time, we will Find someone to sell the house and make more money.” Eric cleaned up the documents in the office, and no matter the last full investor, he would choose to leave for up to three days. The mortgage documents for the theaters and the land under the company name are already in place, and you can get the bank to mortgage at any time and anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is also very simple, they want to expand more business, cash is not enough. Banks have never been jealous of such companies with high quality resources and potential. They even hope that the other party will get better if they give money to their opponents from their pockets, so that they have more interest to take. As for the closure? That’s not a problem. It’s so simple that even the top management is too lazy to ask questions about the bank’s financial resources to support a theater in a region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, Eric waited for three days, he did not wait for the last full investor, he began to act according to plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, he took the suitcase to the mortgage department of the Imperial Central Bank and took out all the documents and title certificates. In fact, as early as two or three He prepared for this in a month ago. All the documents and signatures are available. Only the person responsible for the examination and approval has a chapter. He can take away the 550,000 before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, his company is worth only 550,000, for banks, except for intangible assets that have proven their value in the financial sector, others Those intangible assets that do not flow into the flow have the right to be no. Five hundred thousand is less than Eric’s estimate. He reported a loan of 650,000 and was cut off by the bank by 100,000. But it doesn't matter, he doesn't care, because after the stamp is over, East Coast Entertainment has nothing to do with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is traced, there are a lot of shareholders who help him with his black pot. What is he afraid of? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four bank deposits of $500,000 and less than $100,000, a suitcase is fully placed. After he gave the mortgage department manager an envelope, everything was delivered to him at the fastest speed. Standing outside the bank's gate, he blew the sea breeze from the sea, looking at the beautiful streets and cities like the scrolls, silently bidding farewell to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
