			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Killing?", the priest chuckled, "Mr. Doolin, killing is an illegal act, and the Mother Earth does not advocate the deprivation of others. The power to survive to advocate the value of their existence, this is contrary to the teachings of the seat of the Mother Earth!", this sentence is very positive, certainly to Du Lin that this is an indirect rejection, but the other side of the turn, I took it back again. "But the sinners are not included. Some of the fallen people who attempt to introduce the devil from hell into the world should be purified. Each of these pores is filled with a sulphur-like hell smell. They deserve to be purified!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest always keeps his head down and makes people unable to see his face. I don’t know if this is the god of the gods to protect these gods, or because of other The reason, "Do you have a goal? Or do we need to arrange a goal for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a difference?", Du Lin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course!", the voice of the priest is slightly up. "If you don't have any specific goals, the magic of your heart has been boiling and swelling. You can't calm down, then we will provide some sinners who are guilty and deceived by the devil to let you find peace in your heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin After pondering this guy's words, he asked, "If I have a person who wants to kill?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As I said earlier, The Mother Earth does not advocate the value of the power to deprive others of their existence, and the killing of injustice is not allowed. Please forgive my power is weak, can not tell whether your choice has fallen, this requires a large priest to perceive. You Have a familiar big priest, or a big priest who leads you to the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t understand why I’m already "joining the church," Duulin does have Such an acquaintance, Charles, the great priest. After waiting for the name, Du Lin waited for about ten minutes, and Charles smiled and pushed in. He is different from ordinary low-level priests. He doesn't cover his fluff with his hood. The same white robes have some golden mysterious runes as embellishments, which makes this guy look more than last time. Divine breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let the priest leave after he entered the door, closed the door and walked straight to Du Lin. "I will solve some troubles for you by the will of Ozra." You can tell me the person you want to see, I will use the power to know if he is falling!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, I know, this is just a trick that is not very interesting. Tell me what I should know. Maybe we can really sit down and talk.", Du Lin told Charles and Tus The so-called perception is not at all interesting, because all of this is false. If there is any divine power, I am afraid that the Church of the Lord of Heaven has destroyed all the evil spirits and pagans in the empire, and Du Lin also sees what the so-called perception is all about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is no mysterious place to say it. The so-called perception is actually the way to bring some big words back through the gods and ghosts. If Du Lin’s character is within the capacity of the Tushen, they will tell Du Lin that this person is guilty. Killing him can not only be forgiven by the Mother Earth, but also gain more honor and brilliance. some type of. If this character is very powerful, there is no way for the gods to get people or simply offend, then this person is a good citizen who is not guilty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;killing the good people is not allowed, so the Tushen can only regret to tell Du Lin that this person can not kill, at least not through the Tusi Way to kill this person. As for how Du Lin did after leaving the Tushenism, it was a private feud and had no relationship with the Tushen. There is no saying of anger and revenge in the teachings of the Tushenism. After the Civil War, the entire empire was filled with a faint revenge, but many people did not know it at ordinary times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When someone does something in the name of revenge, it will inevitably win the sympathy of some ordinary people, the law does not advocate revenge, but did not say to stop revenge . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name and identity information of Du Lin’s casual report is not complicated. An old party member, Charles, “perceived” for a while and told Du Lin, this Man is a sinner, he is guilty, and sin is extremely evil. Killing him is something that the church allows, but Doolin wants to kill him and pays a price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, you are a successful businessman, then you must have heard a sentence called 'equivalent exchange', the church's resources are not Unlimited, this is what many people have worked together to have today's grand occasion. If you want to get something, you will naturally have to pay something, if everyone is indefinitely asking for it from the church without asking for a return, There will be no seat of the earth goddess of today. So...", the rest of the time, Charles does not need to say anything, he feels that he has already understood enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin wants to kill an old party member. In fact, this is not a difficult thing for Du Lin. Can also dare to invite Du Lin to join the seat of the Mother Earth, Charles included the entire church to do a very detailed investigation of Du Lin, Du Lin's bottom is not a secret to the top of the Tusi. Since they know that Dooling has the ability to accomplish his own ideas, what good is it with the help of the hands of the gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is very simple. The Tushen teaching can minimize Du Lin’s suspicion. It can even be said that no one will doubt Du Lin’s body, which is very important and attractive for many big people. The reason why the big man is a big man, first of all, the public needs to know this person. Countless pairs of eyes will be staring at these big people. Once they leave any clues or even just doubts, they may have unpredictable consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the official, from the private, from the industry opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tudio can help them achieve their wishes without causing any problems for them, which has a deadly appeal to many people. The higher the status, the more restrictions you have, but everything is not a problem here. To know that killing itself is a very strong emotional fluctuation, it may take only a few minutes from fear to bliss. In these few minutes, the sensation of excitement and the happiness brought by revenge can be addictive and thus more dependent on the Tushen. So what benefits can the Tussarians get from this? In fact, it is also very simple, one thing that must be done within the scope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be why the gods of the gods look very mysterious and have no flaws. They can help people of all kinds to achieve their own desires that they cannot complete, regardless of Whether these wishes are mediocre, great or crazy, they need to make a promise. No one will preach about what kind of “soul sublimation” and “calmness” he has gained in the Tushenism, and it is even more impossible to tell others that they have made an unknown promise to get these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gradual Tudioism has become an organization that people can do in the mouth, and can enjoy everything here without any effort... Also lie to yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, as you know, we are all members of the dear and loved ones, we all believe in the earth god god Ozola, because of our unity Friendship, let us be friends, even relatives. Today, we will try our best to help you fulfill your wishes, then if one day, within your ability, we need your help, will you help us? "Charles did not show any discomfort at all because of an ugly trade. He was more like a businessman than Doolin at this time. "Benefit and gain are the eternal truths of the world, no one can change." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin puts the lighter in his hand and looks down on the ground. It looks like he is thinking about something. "I need to think about it. Not quite the same as I thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
