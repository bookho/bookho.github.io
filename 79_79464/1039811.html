			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Refugees!", Mr. Otto sighed with a sigh of relief. "This vocabulary is very accurate. It seems that Mr. Doolin is doing these things to the West." I have been studying for a while." He feels that from the beginning to the present, Du Lin has promoted the whole thing in places where people can't see. His layout of the west has surpassed Otto's imagination, and perhaps this happens all the time. The things are part of the Doolin plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used these things to solve the stubborn old forces in the West, such as the West Mine, and also gave the Mennon a critical strike if it follows the normal process. Operation, now the cabinet may have been drafted throughout the country, to cancel the position of the farmer. At this time, the only strength in the entire West is the capitalists. But these capitalists who should have stood up when the peasants were suffering did not stand up. Does it mean that they have already fallen to the side of Doolin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a good chance that with the cooperation between the farmers and these capitalists, they will not be able to watch the fall of the doormen, and the farmers will represent their interests in the west. Is a very key person. When they let the doormen fall, they will encounter a lot of troubles, from the working class, from the western mining owners, including problems from within them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, they don’t say anything, just like the collective silence that has already been premeditated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewing Mr. Otto of Doolin again recalled that Magus said his warning to him when he left, telling him that he must carefully observe Du Lin. In the absence of letting Du Lin feel dangerous, he analyzes and dismantles all his layouts. This young man is the only person Magus thinks has made him feel dangerous in 30 years. It’s not that the single political danger comes from all-round danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with a person who doesn’t know what he is pursuing, how to pursue it, is confused about his life plan and is a little indecisive. Dress yourself up as a messenger of love and peace, stand at the fork in the road and point him in the wrong direction, and tell him that he will be able to walk to his destination in the wrong direction. Such people will be very grateful for the wrong tips and then go in the wrong direction, even if he starts to realize that this road may be wrong, he will not hesitate to deny his point of view, because his indecision will make him There is a "take a few more steps" idea, which is a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many such people, especially in the political arena. They are filled with the best scammers and fraudsters in the world. After the movie, they can vividly turn themselves into the roles they want and become what others want. Roles, such as "superior with love and recognition for yourself", "colleagues who are full of cooperative spirit never give up", "subordinates with brave pioneering spirit and courage to be responsible", or stupid, naive, reckless... ...in short, what they want to be, it will make people see that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of deceptive people naturally formed a big scam and eliminated all unqualified competitors. This is one of the rules of the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Du Lin is an exception. He knows what he wants and knows where he wants to go. He rarely places his hopes on the fate. To conceal his weak excuses, he is one of the few people who can see clearly and even dare to punch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being dismissed from the accident in Otis City, Du Lin simply did not go to the Imperial City to run a relationship, or try to try to save the failed situation. . He directly lost a good hand that clearly won the game. He stood up from the table without paying no regrets and went to the next table. He is very clear that this win-and-loss game is not winning in the game outside the game, so he gives up decisively and changes position again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of person will not be lost for a lifetime, and in this life they will only do one thing, as long as they succeed in this matter, the whole world will It is eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus has raised the level of danger to Doolin again, and it has been dark red. Of course, Du Lin is not very clear. It's not that he doesn't want to know it or that he can't understand it, but he doesn't want to confuse his current mood and state with something that he must face in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of both of them are very calm, just like two idle street friends on a leisurely afternoon while on the two adjacent loungers in the park. Awakened, they did not have any emotional fluctuations in their vision, and did not want to reveal any valuable information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, Doolin’s eyes matched the smile on his face and gave a strong confidence and some subtle signal,” Mr. Otto You praised it. Actually, I didn't do any research. It was purely an impulse. Of course, I have to thank my luck. At least I can think of this seemingly good attention. For the Empire, I will always be loyal. "There is a slap in the face, the deep eyes are full of a firm light, even Mr. Otto has believed Du Lin's words for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze dropped a little and fell on Doolin's nose, which would not make Doolin feel the strength and attack in his heart, but also maintain his grace and courtesy, and he did not want to see Du Lin. The pair of deceptive eyes, "I will talk about this plan with the Magus leader at a later time. Now there is another question. You should know that the four executives of the West Mine have already fled to the Federation, so... "As he talked and looked at Doolin's expression, Du Lin frowned. He continued, "So many problems can't be solved now, but there is another person who can barely assume most of the responsibilities." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto closed his mouth in a timely manner, and Du Lin followed up and said, "You want to say Mr. Mennon, is it?" There is a doubt in Otto’s heart. If Du Lin is pushing these things, then he will inevitably insert his sword into the heart of the doorman, so He needs to explore the tone again. "Yes, Mr. Mennon. From the questions clarified by Mr. Federer and Mr. Amon, as well as some of the problems that some mine owners took the initiative to stand up, we can already confirm that Mr. Mennon had secretly colluded with the Western Mining Association and the capitalists in the west. They formed a chain of interests that were alienated but very close to each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of the loops now flees, and the other ring has not shown destructive Then, only Mr. Mennon can bear all the responsibilities of this western turmoil. I think that Mr. Mennon is not suitable as the leader of the Kadima Party and continue to lead the social public opinion in the west. He should go where he should go, such as prison. "What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not hesitate to say what Otto had not thought about. "I have a different opinion, Mr. Otto. Now the big problem in the west has basically been solved, but there are still some details waiting to be dealt with. No matter who is probably no one, Mr. Mennon is more familiar with the West and understands more. We should not only not Mr. Mennon is deeply involved in the criminal charges. Instead, he should try his best to exonerate Mr. Mennon. If you or the cabinet solves most of the details in Mr. Mennon, you still feel that Mr. Mennon should be allowed to go to the law. It’s not necessary to initiate a retrial.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto felt a bit of acid, he took a sip of cigarettes, and Doolin has always shown a kind of glory for the citizens At the same time, the attitude makes him feel funny, but there is also an awe-inspiring attitude that cannot be said. Du Lin is more treacherous than he imagined. Hey, he doesn't give him any words at all. His role is really like a young man who is infinitely loyal to the empire. The more this is the case, the more it means that Du Lin has problems, but he can't find the place where he can tear his disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
