			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s me, Henry." Henry stood by the window of the study. He had just returned from the outside and honestly he liked the West. There are no people he hates, such as his brother, nor a wife who makes him feel depressed. His relationship with his brother is not good. It is possible that the relationship between all the children and brothers and sisters born in the dignitaries will not be good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the aristocratic family, everyone is competing for a position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the big capital family like the steel tycoon, all the children are madly fighting for equity, even if it is one in ten, one in 100,000 They will not let go. Not to mention that in the home of the steel tycoon, there are two children who are excellent in all aspects. They have been secretly comparing to determine who is the best family in the end. Successor. Therefore, Henry does not like to express his strong brother everywhere, even at the grade level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the West, no one is fighting with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not only his annoying brother, but also the wife who looks boring. He loves his wife very much, and more than once determines that the woman is the woman he most wants to spend with his life, but these things do not prevent him from feeling his wife's boring. It is like an old-school Christian. Even the descendants of the family must use the position of the priest and refuse to change. Perhaps it was the biggest mistake for Mr. John to let her read the church school founded by the church, but this did not prevent him from determining that he loved her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, love will turn into water after sweetness, from addictive sweetness to what is necessary for human life, he will occasionally adjust it. Drink some sweet things for your own needs. In the west, these things are not only sweet, but also as strong as spirits! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry runs the name of the steel tycoon in the west to run the most important part of the family business - acquiring metal ore and turning these metal ores into metal ingots . This is the foundation of all the steel tycoons. If you don't have these ingots, then the brother who claims to be the most important part of the family business – selling, has nothing to sell. Nothing to sell means no profit, even if he can continue to eat into the market of others, he must have enough goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both brothers think that they are the most important part of the family business. Their reasons are very similar, the products or sales, and the analysis is very reasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The West is the largest mining area in the Empire, but it is not an easy task to stand here. The mining area owned by Union Steel Group does not provide enough iron ore, so Henry wants his products to keep up with his brother's sales, and he must buy ore from other mines, and there is a problem. Whether it is Jindis or Orvili's shipment rate of metal ore is constantly floating, these large industry monopolies are not operating their business for the purpose of sales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They operate on pricing power, are rules, are monopolies, so they will not endlessly ship, not if you have money to buy, you will sell Yours, there are a lot of things that have nothing to do with the West, such as politics, such as "goods" that are completely detached from money and goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Henry very angry, coupled with the West Mine’s resistance to big capitalists, it’s harder to get a mine than an ordinary person. Many times. The West Mine will fight with him, and Jindis will fight with him, and Orvili will fight with him. Coupled with some mining groups, Henry’s days in the West are not as fast as people think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been trapped here for many years and has not found a breakthrough, but now he has found it, the breakthrough is Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Du Lin met privately, and more than once, the two quickly found what they needed from each other, that is, as soon as possible The way to open the situation in the west. They belong to the small group of people who are being squeezed out. They all need to expand their careers to prove their worth. As for Du Lin, he raised the axe that cut the famous George family and cut the first axe. It will not become. The obstacles to his cooperation with Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The George family is the George family, the Ander family is the Ander family, perhaps married to each other, but definitely not to be confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just gave him a call and needed some help from him to prove that he was qualified to compete with Du Lin for the fat in the west. Henry called his father, the first call he gave Mr. Ander after the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Ander, as the largest equity owner of United Steel Group, has far more social status and influence than ordinary people, even Henry called him. After the housekeeper can be connected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Henry? I heard that the West is very interesting recently. Do you want to come back?" Mr. Ander’s voice is very rich. He is now learning to sing a play, and elegant people always have a little hobby. Things like playing the piano have missed the age of learning, but it is not too late to sing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry wrapped his wrapper, he put down the curtains and went back to the chair to sit down. "I heard that you have a good relationship with the Ministry of Defense. The West is now Entering the state of military control, this has had a big impact on all businesses. Our workers are reluctant to go home, and they are reluctant to come to work when they return home. They are afraid of being brutally treated or even killed. Not long ago, the Brewer Bay mining area was attacked by the Freedom Front. Now almost all mines have stopped trading, and the Freedom Front people will not be destroyed one day. They may not sell the ore to us one day."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other end of the phone, Mr. Ander finally got serious. As Henry said, he knows the people of the Ministry of Defense. He has a good network in addition to the Ministry of Defense. Lord Gus also has some friendship. As the largest steel group in the Empire, there are huge consumer groups in both civil and military fields. In particular, the rapid economic recovery, the infrastructure of various places has created a huge steel consumer market. Coupled with the continued replacement of Army armament this year, the military industry group also has a large number of orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he has contacts with all levels of the country, he needs to sell goods, and those who need to buy goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, if only, if there is no steel to complete some orders, the impact on Union Steel will be unprecedented. The cabinet will be disappointed with him. The military will be disappointed with him. The local governments and the small companies will also disappoint him. This is something that Mr. Ander does not allow. His expression was very serious and he changed his sitting position. "What do you want me to do for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry breathed a sigh of relief, he slid his leg Roots are stuffed into the mouth and lit, and the whole person is in a state of high relaxation. "I hope that you can express your views to the Ministry of Defense, such as focusing on the elimination of the Freedom Front, an armed extremist organization. At least I can get what we need from which mines."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the situation really so serious?", Mr. Ander still can't. I believe that I have never heard of mining mines that are afraid to sell mines. I have never only bought mines and dare to enter the mining area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the facts are much more serious than imagined. The details of the Freedom Front's killing of Brewer Bay have been revealed inexplicably. People discovered that people had bought them through kidnappings and threats more than a month ago. A trading company that trades with Brewer Bay. Then they spent so much time figuring out the defensive measures and the number of guards in Brewer Bay, where the slaves provided some of the most valuable information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, under the circumstance, Brewer Bay, a mining area that has never been challenged, was completely destroyed when it first encountered a challenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has caused many mines to be frightened. Ghosts know that they are providing supplies for themselves, or whether the other party who has frequent trade with them is a free front, they will not The same means has been arranged in his own mine, waiting for the moment he opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now all the mining areas are tightening their nerves, even if they are replenishing, they also ask the trade bank to throw the supplies outside the mining area, after the withdrawal of the traders They will organize the mine protection team and the formal local staff to open the door to pull in supplies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the unloading of the mining area? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, that's impossible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the purchase of ore, such as United Steel Group, it is reasonable to put them in. After all, United Steel Group is not a small trading company. But who can guarantee that the people who buy the ore will be the people of the United Steel Group, not the Freedom Front counterfeit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a good idea to open the door and send the ore out, but there are also big risks. Let the slaves send, the slaves will definitely run, but if the employees and the mine protection team are sent, what if the slaves in the camp suddenly launch riots and the outside starts to attack? It’s important to know that the slaves in the Brewer Bay mining area were rushing out of the mine with pistols and single-shot rifles. There was not enough firepower to suppress them. Once similar things happened in their camps, those mine protection teams simply suppressed Can not resist the resistance and riots of the slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, simply don’t sell it! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr. Ander learned that the situation in the west was so serious that he had called Henry’s phone, he immediately called the Minister of Defense’s Ministry of Defense. Then he expressed his views on the situation in the west and his concerns, and mentioned the danger of the Freedom Front to the Empire. After the Minister of Defense understood the matter, after a telephone conference call, he finally decided to change the strategy slightly, first stabilize the situation outside the western city, and then clean up the chaotic forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
