			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Navy’s “protection,” Amp quickly got the evidence in Bruni’s mouth, a note with time and place. But there is no other information and words. Bruni told Amp that Doolin was a very cautious guy. He couldn't leave any direct evidence, only the time and place. As for what he wants to do, the newsboy who passed the message verbally conveyed it to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin asked for only one, and Juan wanted to "suicide." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp feels a bit weird when he gets this note, the weird thing is that the time and place indicated on this note is a bit fuzzy, he Not sure what this meant, but instinctively put the note in the pocket and found the newsboy that Bruni said. The newsboy is only 12 years old, the Ogingin, his father died in a construction site collapse, and the mother needs to support three children. Therefore, this little guy named Kirby took the responsibility of sharing the burden of the family early. Reported to earn a meager salary subsidy for the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Kirby, Du Lin asked him to hand this note to a guy named Bruni in the fifth district, and asked him to tell Bruni. In a word, the content of the original words is "Huan committed suicide." He didn't know what it meant, but he did what Dulin asked, and Du Lin gave him a tip for a dollar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more witnesses have surfaced, and more and more evidence points to Doolin’s planning of this “murder case”, and Amp is uplifting At the same time, I felt that there seemed to be a cloud over my own sky. He has a feeling that he can't tell clearly, just like... falling into the water, the surrounding sea water squeezes to make him feel chest tightness, difficult to breathe, but when he wants to struggle, he finds that he just did a battle. dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the chain of evidence has become perfect, the confession of the Imperial Capital has also been passed over, and has been paying attention to this case and named Amp’s Deputy Minister of Finance, Called Amp. His meaning is very simple. If you think that Doolin is the mastermind, mastermind and executor behind this actual fraud, if you feel that the evidence in your hand can pull him down first, then do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, trouble you to think about what makes sense in the last minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is no evidence to date that Du Lin’s actual fraud is related. Some are just some indirect evidence. For example, Luke’s six million suspected anonymous fund account, according to himself, should have been Transferred to Doolin. If he didn't lie, Du Lin absolutely played an important role in it. Only by first holding him in custody can he slowly remove the murder of Juan into the actual fraud case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit of a violation of the operation, but in the face of 70 million funds, the above will default to this less formal practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the pressure from all parties, Amp finally decided to accuse Doolin of planning the death of Juan! But the way he chose was very clever. He just accused Du Lin of being suspected of buying a murderer. Other things were not mentioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is good and bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage is that if you find key evidence in the future, you can directly accuse him of planning and implementing the Golden Robbery and the Century Fraud, not because of the Empire Law. The provisions in it allowed him to evade these two cases. But there is also a downside. The downside is that the case of Juan occurred in Irian from beginning to end, and the trial will be placed in the court of the Irian area, not in the capital. This gives the already very confident case a change that Amp does not want to see. Du Lin’s prestige and status in this area are enough to directly influence the jury’s resolution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He applied to the Supreme Court of the Empire to mobilize a group of jury members from other cities and regions to form a new jury to participate in the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court of the Empire agreed to Amp’s claim and placed the first trial of the murder case on February 1. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last two days of leaving the court, Doolin returned to Ilyan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was a little accident in this trip, a few days later than planned." Du Lin taught the coat to Dove and went to the sofa. Sitting down on the side, relieved with a sigh of relief. Nowhere is it comfortable in his own home, he can unscrupulously tilt his foot to the coffee table, or can be deeply trapped in the sofa without any image, no one will say that he is not, because here is his nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin replied with a focus on the video player, which is what Du Lin called TV, and played last year. a movie. In the capacity of Kevin, the barrister, he must have no time to go to the cinema to waste. The conversation fee of a few hundred hours an hour has long shackled him in the law firm. Life is always like this. If you get more things from others, such as money, you will naturally lose more things than others, such as freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at it, and then a very shameful spoiler. "The man died later, and the woman and the neighbor got married."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next Second, Kevin turned back to glare Du Lin, the two men squatted for a while, Kevin broke out. "Damn, you ruined my expectation in front of an hour!", he waved his arms, a little excited, The face is not so happy. "The Ministry of Justice should really legislate for your behavior. People who say the story and the ending should shut up for a month!" He ran over and turned off the TV, never wanting again. Looked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were silent for a while and laughed at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the situation, tell me, I am interested in what you do." Du Lin said, taking out a box of cigarettes from his pocket. His recent addiction is a bit big. "Isn't it smashed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin laughed and didn't answer, after a while, he was disgusted. "I found that I didn't notice anything. Well, Amp bite it. There is news from the emperor. He didn't want to sue this time, but someone gave him a lot of pressure. , forcing him to do this. Are you contributing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. He sold a bit of information to the feature man as an "informer". The news, these news became the last straw to overwhelm the camel. The seriously damaged stocks have seen the latest developments in the case from the newspaper. It is said that the target has been locked, but the suspect’s identity is special, so the investigation bureau has not made any new progress for the time being. According to informed sources, the Imperial Police Investigation Bureau and the Ministry of Finance intend to deal with this matter in a cold manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The popular saying is that when this incident has not happened, it will naturally be forgotten after a long time. So the investors who felt that they were blinded went to the streets in anger, marched outside the Imperial Police Investigation Bureau and the Ministry of Finance, and solemnly protested their cover-up behavior against Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, the official is investigating who is walking the wind, letting the media get rid of this news, on the one hand, under pressure, let the deputy minister of the Ministry of Finance turn to Ann Pu, as long as it is possible, then let's get started! Now that they have been grilled on the fire by stockholders and public opinion, they will not be sued, they may have to bear the nickname for a long time, and some people will even impeach them. If the lawsuit is over, at least this pot will not be carried by them, but by Anpu, as well as Hedock, Luke and others who have been arrested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such circumstances, Amp, who had intended to apply for more time, could only nod and agree. Everything simplifies the process under the high-level operation. Everyone's eyes are concentrated on Irian, concentrated in Doolin. On the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin gave a thumbs up to Du Lin, and this kind of self-reporting behavior is really a good thing, but it is still the most useful. What he has always worried about is that Amp will feel that the evidence chain is not perfect. He will not sue Du Lin for the time being. After the case is closed, he will continue to secretly collect evidence and then find a chance to bring down Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are too many such cases, and the method of operation is very convenient. In many cases, the end of a case does not mean that the investigation is over. There is a word in the investigation bureau called “Supplementary Investigation”. The purpose is to send some criminals who may be involved in the case but have no evidence to support the conviction of impunity. The work of the prison. As for how to operate a case that has been tried by the court for final trial? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eunuch, for example, the Luke in their hands, as long as they operate, let Luke initiate a report for the reduction of the sentence, report other and not The captured participants will be able to plant Du Lin in a logical way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin’s first step to push the opponent and himself to the edge of the cliff, relieved his pressure and transferred the pressure to Amp’s body. It can't be said to be unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Kevin dared to "crime" with Du Lin. Everyone is an old fox. One plus one will be greater than two and will not be less than two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So look at me next time!", Kevin patted his chest and made a call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the first prison of the Empire, Bruni, under the guard of a prison guard, left his single cell and slowly stepped in. Prison restaurant. The restaurant is large and can accommodate more than a thousand people. In the Imperial First Prison, there are ten such restaurants, and the prisoners will be divided into three batches of meals in order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruni is the second batch of people serving the prisoner because of the particularity of the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a separate inspector and a table for a separate meal, but he needs to bring a meal from the chef and bring him back with a plate. A few days ago, he was very honest, which made the prison guard a little numb, and he was a little far from Bruni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
