"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course!" After Du Lin let the Buddha close the door, he sat back, Alexander and Garfield sitting on either side of him, Doolin After sorting out the ideas, I slowly said: "Do you think the West is far away?" Alexander and Garfield even nodded and agreed that the west is too remote, not only the bad weather, but also the Gobi Desert, desertification. There is also a little bit of a sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have to say that several big cities in the west are still very good, and even some people take the initiative to go to the west because there are women, casinos, and many more. The Hawker is having fun there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why people have been attracted to the past is not because they are so prosperous, or there is fun in other places, but gold mines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gold mine that has been discovered and not yet discovered is like a beacon in the night, countless rich people and people who are trying to get rich overnight Gathered to the west, they are constantly looking for any gold mines that may be found in the jungle, and therefore wrestle with nature and wrestle with animals to fight humans. They have money and need to relax. The most famous gold caves in the empire are not on the east coast, but in the barren mountains and old forests of the empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doolin paused for about two or three seconds after speaking out of the West, Garfield’s eyes slammed round, and he lowered his voice, one word and one word. Squeezing out of his throat, I can see that he is very excited now. "You mean... there is a gold mine here?" He said that he couldn't help but lick his mouth, anything with gold mines. The place of relationship is destined to quickly become a gathering place for the rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mine owner needs to cash in gold, and the miners who swallow the golden sands or stuff them into the gang gate will also cash out the stolen gold, those skilled women. After receiving a stinky smoker, the sands that came out of their gang door also had to be realized. Gold is very valuable and very valuable, but everyone knows that although gold is not worthy of being used as money, this thing can be used for consumption only after it has been exchanged for money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives the money-laundering dealers in the underground world an innate washing machine that can turn some unseen money into gold and then transfer to themselves to dig In the mine where there is no gold, it will be shipped out. After paying a portion of the tax, the Imperial Tax Department will help them clean the gold, which is the most useful and most used channel for money launderers. Because no one knows for a long time that there is no gold in the mine, and naturally it is impossible to trace whether the source of these gold is a stolen goods or a gold ore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding to the fact that these people traded in the sands and gold mines, they are still more convincing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of large sums of money will definitely make this a paradise and a paradise. Garfield really thinks there is a gold mine, otherwise the one he took down is still Less than eight square kilometers of land, what can be worth millions of millions? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Garfield's guess Du Lin directly shook his head and denied, "There is no gold mine here, but there is something more like a gold mine than a gold mine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has popularized some illegal knowledge for the two legitimate businessmen in detail, for example, it is very suitable for smuggling, for example, it is very suitable for opening a casino, for example, it is suitable do anything. The reason for all this is Du Lin, who is the mayor here, and he has the final say here. He does not let people close the casino, the casino can operate as usual. He does not let people check the smuggled goods, smugglers will take the initiative to pay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the North and South smugglers regard this as the junction between North and South, it is destined to be very prosperous. As we all know, the most profitable trades have been recorded in the Imperial Law in detail. What happens if people suddenly have a place that has not been “disregarded” by the law? Of course, they will build this building into their nest and do a good job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe Du Lin will have a new mayor to take office after he leaves, but no matter who he is, it is impossible to change the pattern here unless the new mayor Has given up the value of life in the self, and the pursuit of the future. Without these illegal people, there will be a depression here, and it will become what it is today, so the mayor who succeeds will inevitably be blamed - although Du Lin intends to make this a paradise for heaven, Taxes still have to be taxed, and the tax rate is heavier than elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those smuggling merchants who do illegal trade will not mind the tax here. After paying taxes, they are not illegal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;瞧, this is a circle, as long as you can get out of the first step, then it is absolutely a matter of course. At that time, the land in their hands was not available for 100,000 pieces, millions of tens of millions or more, and they were not casually talked about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Du Lin’s development plan here, Alexander and Garfield both gasped. They intended to help their friends to support their faces. I didn't expect to have a big bargain, and they could directly double their own worth. How can this benefit make them not excited? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When are you going to start this plan?" Garfield asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and told him to start tomorrow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Du Lin spent money to find some young people who didn’t want to leave the city, hired them to become policemen, and then took them with them. The new police officers who did not have much police uniforms stood on the platform of the train. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want someone to come here to settle down and develop, first let others know that it is different and impressive, so how do you let others know? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very simple, hit him first! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the steam locomotive schedule, a steam locomotive will stop here for fifteen minutes after five minutes. However, these steam locomotives have long been accustomed to not stopping here, so Doolin dishes come with more than 20 people. He made a slight repair on the platform while letting people hang red cloth on the stop sign, which means the train needs to stop here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three minutes, a steam locomotive appeared in people's sights, and there was a constant flow of water vapor from the venting hole, which was not completely close. Let the people on the platform feel the vibration from the feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steam locomotive driver who had no intention of slowing down stopped after seeing the red cloth in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may think that someone is leaving this, but what he didn’t think was that when he stopped completely, there was a young man who was particularly handsome in police uniform. I rushed into the cab and pointed his pistol at his head and asked him to get off the bus for inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary checkpoints are not uncommon on the railway. They happen once or twice a month, but never once appeared in the ghost place of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin personally took the passengers and drove the passengers in the passenger compartment, emptying the entire three compartments, and then leaving the remaining twelve compartments. The doors are fully open. As a veteran who has participated in and executed many smuggling programs, Du Lin is fully aware of the virtues of these smugglers. In order to ensure the safety of these goods, they will definitely have someone to take the car, but the number of people who are driving this time is no longer useful<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
