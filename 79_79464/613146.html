Under the independence of Mason and Doolin, the family has already given birth to a desire to rush out of the nest and go to the outside world. He knew that he couldn't do anything about it, so he started to find some other hobbies for himself, such as taking care of some potted plants that he thought were very good-looking and connotative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source of these potted plants is mostly derived from the farmland, or the newly grown branches under a tree, which can not be removed from the cultivation. In the potted plants, Mr. Kesma seems to have recovered his satisfaction with the desire to control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no detailed plans and concepts for the conservation and pruning of potted plants. He only knows how to make these little things look like they want. Holding the scissors in the hand and aiming at a small bud that had just been drilled from the tree branch on the branch, the door of the living room was suddenly pushed away very violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highly focused attention is being shaken by Mr. Xerma, who is holding scissors for the ideal potted plant, and even more so, he cut it down. . Looking at most of the branches on the ground, lying still, Mr. Ke Ma took a moment, then put the scissors on the table silently, bent down and picked up the cut branches on the ground and held them in his hands. The eyes turned to the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to see, who dares to make such a big move in Mr. Zema’s home. Just as he opened the door and prepared to swear, the whole person seemed to be pressed by the pause button - he rubbed his eyes, his tight face muscles bounced twice, his eyes immediately softened, but The face is still very serious and stereotyped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God is on, my lovely Du Lin is back!", a figure smashed past him, and opened a smile and waited for praise. Mason, the body of Du Linyi hugs in the white bottom, the green floral arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin gently patted the woman’s broad, full-backed back. “Yes, mom, I’m back.” He followed and looked at Mr. Sma, Mr. Kesma’s emotions have been calmed down in a very short time. He walked over to the side of the wicker chair and sat down, took a sip of the water, took the pipe out of his pocket, and licked it on his mouth. , a look at Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the exclamation of Mrs. Xerma’s cry, the house of Kesma’s house seems to have come alive. Brothers and sisters, brothers and sisters are like magicians who are hiding in a corner waiting to call, and then run all at once. Come out. They revolved around Doolin and asked one question after another, and Du Lin just smiled and did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reunion after the separation is really a surprise, and - strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youngest sister is standing in the door frame, not leaning against other brothers and sisters, some sly eyes with some indescribable sense of alienation , standing far away. It was only three months, but it was still a little longer for the children. It was a long time that some familiar Tongxi became strangers. Dooling waved at the sister named Lilith, and Lilith slowly hesitated and moved slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this mind of a child who is only five years old...or four years old, something about Doolin has become somewhat strange. From time to time, she looked at Mr. Xerma, who was able to give her courage in the room, and was close to Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took out a candy wrapped in kraft paper from his pocket, and the girl’s eyes suddenly lit up, and the strangeness disappeared. Without a trace, I suddenly rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugar is not a luxury, but it is not cheap enough for everyone to enjoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at what you look like... It seems to be a good mix in the city?" Mr. Xerma looked up and down Du Lin and could not help but nod. In fact, he is not sure how much the money that Du Lin can wear, but it should not be too bad. Mr. Xmas does not know that Du Lin is back in the car, and he does not know what he did in the town, otherwise it will not be as calm as it is now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mr. Kesma’s stereotyped thinking, this very decent suit may be rented or borrowed, just to support himself. The face is not ridiculed by him. Mr. Xerma raised his legs and felt a lot of emotions in his heart. Although he only had three months to go, Du Lin had a lot of mature things and knew how to cover up his embarrassment and poverty by other means to comfort him. Loved ones at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a long sigh of relief and made a sound, the whole family was quiet, everyone looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
