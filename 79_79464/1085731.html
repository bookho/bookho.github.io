			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagrid is a very common name. The common word means that the mayor of Hagrid may be a civilian class, but he can do it. The mayor of St. Nunnington's city, this shows that there are people above him, and there are people behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No official has ever been able to do this without relying on anyone, which has nothing to do with personal abilities, because the top resources are always extremely limited. More importantly, these limited resources are in the hands of very few people. So now the question is coming. Why do other people divide their limited resources into a person they don’t know? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not about morality and occupation. It is nature, it is possessiveness in the bones, mine is mine, and it will not be given to anyone for no reason. At this time, more means are needed to operate and operate. The simple thing is to find someone with the same resources in hand, exchange resources, and then allocate resources. This is why the official position of the empire goes up. The reason for the difficulty, because these have been separated from the scope of personal ability and executive ability, belong to another field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very common name means that Hagrid is likely to be a Bobos person, and of course this is in line with the propaganda policy of Magus after he took office, he The non-aristocratic officials will be promoted to important positions in a more comprehensive and in-depth manner to ensure more support. This is also the reason why Bowworth can achieve the third place in the party. Magus is more aware of the progress of the times than the decaying aristocrats. Power cannot be completely concentrated in the hands of one or two people. Only the interests are allowed. In the scope of the spread to more people, in order to obtain a more stable regime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higger is likely to be an official of the Bowworth group, but whether it is a nobleman from a nobleman or a newcomer from a civilian origin, the training in Magus Understand the truth that capitalism is a very horrible and hateful thing. Sometimes it will show people in a cute face, but in the end, if the capital wants to grow, it needs to eat people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagrid came to participate in this cocktail party initiated by the joint construction workers, what is the purpose? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Grace's energy looks great, even people like you can come in. No wonder I feel a little different when I come in. It turned out that you are here." Du Lin touted Mr. Hagrid. He said that he used to be a New Party and he was the mayor of Otis. Hagrid’s ranking in the party has entered the top forty-eight. In the big list of the New Party Committee, the ranking is lower than that of Harry, which can be said to be a high-powered representative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagrihah laughed. "Mr. Du Lin said that I feel that I have lost a little weight. Don't use honorific words between us. This makes us feel that our relationship has some strangeness..." After Du Lin’s affirmation, Hagrid’s unchanging color led Du Lin to the edge of the meeting and whispered, “Today’s federal side submitted a formal diplomatic note, hoping to renegotiate about the currency understanding. The memo is related to the matter. When the cabinet was in session, the Magus leader was very angry..." He looked as though he had leaked secrets that should not be leaked, but he and Du Lin did not take it seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between Doolin and Magus, as well as his personal connections in the upper part of society, there will always be people who will tell him about this. And this is not a secret that needs to be conservative. Secondly, even if I don’t say it now, it will take a long time for the two countries’ diplomatic consultations to be held. It will definitely be a storm in the city. It’s hard to know if you don’t know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s better to sell someone who doesn’t want money, and by the way keep a good personal relationship with Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bowworth has been working with Magus since the mid-term election. This momentum is not clear to many people, only the people in the New Party Committee know. Bowworth is always questioning the decision of Magus, and Magus will sometimes counterattack the trouble of looking for Bowworth. It is said that Harry will become the next cabinet chief, the prime minister of the empire, the new leader of the new party. He is the successor of the Magus will and the full successor. In this case, even if the officials of the civilians have no idea, they have some ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always people who win and lose between the two contradictions. If Bowworth can’t be the next New Party leader, he can’t be prime minister, his The era is over. He didn't have time to wait another eight years and then re-initiated the charge to the highest position. Maybe he couldn't live for the next eight years. Once Bobos withdrew from the political arena, their new members of the civilian party would face a very embarrassing situation. After Bowworth, no one could come to pick up the pillars and support the banner and backbone of the populist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of prestige is not enough, the strength of prestige is not enough, Bauhaus himself is actually very anxious, he also wants Margots to pick a few suitable The successor, including Hagrid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Hagrid’s heart is not willing, the reason is very simple, even if Bovos is very trusting, he is willing to let him become the successor of his political heritage, he also needs After eight years of the next election year, Boworth’s legacy will become its own wealth, re-integrate all the resources in its hands and make these resources willing to pay for themselves. In other words, he needs more than ten years. In a little bit of time, I was able to achieve the degree of Bowworth today. At that time, he was already more than sixty. If the competition fails, then he will face another long eight-year ruling period, and by that time he will be no different from the current Bowworth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The age of seventy-year-old is two steps away from the Friends of the Peak, but the distance between these two steps is enough to make him unable to climb. He is equal to turning his next life into a continuation of Bowworth's political life. In the end, he has to choose a suitable person, and then entrust all his political wealth that he has run for half a lifetime to that person. Do not leave the retreat, and occasionally look at the newspapers to see the young people dancing the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not what he wants, he wants a comfortable life and proper power, when the mayor of the city is fine, he is willing to If you go on, it would be better if you could be released to other states as a governor. Those games that compete for hegemony will let the ambitious people play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make some important figures is the experience that Hagrid has been an official since, and Magus has been constraining the rapid expansion of capitalism, but everyone has already understood it. Capitalism can't be restrained. The important reason why Marquez can now tremble the northern consortium is that he has been in power for more than 30 years as the leader of the new party. He has served two prime ministers and has been in office for too long. The authority that grows to him should be above the entire social mechanism. His tentacles have penetrated into all aspects of society, but once he leaves the political arena of the empire, the capital forces that have been suppressed for so long will immediately rebound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, making a big business like Du Lin is the most insured speculation, and maybe it will become an important bargain when. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is obviously still unclear about this matter. This diplomatic note was handed over directly to the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the federal diplomatic ambassador, and there was no leak. It is also in line with Hagrid's reason here, but also makes Du Lin confused about another thing, but now is not the time to consider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not continue to ask this topic, and asked Mayor Hagrid not necessarily know what, ultimately all decisions are made by the cabinet, one The mayor is still not able to decide on the cabinet, or the decision of Magus. But at the same time, Du Lin knew that he was getting less and less time in the empire. He had a big idea a few years ago. He wanted to get a big plan. This plan was originally only two people, he and Mr. Jack, but because of the financial resources that can be mobilized. For the sake of the end, things became more and more complicated, and more and more people joined. Finally, even the Imperial Bank and the Cabinet were involved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, this is not a big plan for one person, but a... potential battle between the country and the country as a war. The conductor, Du Lin is honored, because he has been deeply aware that his name will be engraved in historical occasions, and is still the most shining one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just that I have some questions to ask Hagrid Mayor..." Du Lin quickly reversed the topic to another direction. Hagrid showed a serious look, and he was a very good official. It is no longer necessary to obviously favor a certain thing or someone in his position, but his attitude makes Du Lin feel that he is a good person, at least not because he has some power in his hand, so arrogant, "I There is a TV station on the side of the Imperial Capital..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heage nodded. "I know that the signal line can be uninterrupted 24 hours a day. The TV station that watched the show."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer gave Doolin some small surprises, "Hagrid Mayor also know?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haghaha laughed. "Of course, I am very concerned about this TV station. I want to know that my wife and my children love the tapes. We have not fallen in the period, just as I want to ask, when will the emperor be able to get it right? I must be the first member."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It is also what I want to say. Now the construction of the TV station has encountered some problems, Imperial Art Research. Some people think that the construction will destroy the style and historical sites of the Emperor, so the construction has temporarily stopped."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagrid stunned, "These... I will After asking, these things are actually managed by the Social Service Bureau. The Imperial Academy cannot interfere with the administration. They do not have this ability and they do not have this power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Du Lin also stunned. He then laughed. "I have already asked others about this matter. It should be solved soon. When I will smash the company, I will move the first line into your residence." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you so much!", Hagrid raised his glass and touched Du Lin, meaning that their conversation ended and they continued to talk. There is nothing to say, there is really nothing here to talk about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two separated, Du Lin recalled what the Mayor Hagrid had just said. He pondered for a while and turned to tell the Buddha. "Go to the Hill family." A little girl is looking for it, I want to talk to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the federal insists on amending the Monetary Memorandum of Understanding and even tearing up the agreement, Ma Gus also wouldn’t sit up and watch the federal climb higher after stepping on the empire. The reason why there was such an agreement on money in the past, Du Lin also made a lot of effort. From the point of view of the time, stabilizing the exchange rate between the two countries is of great help to the trade between the two countries. At least the empire will not suffer too much in the export trade, and no one will take any advantage. At the same time, in terms of imported materials, the use of savings in foreign exchange is also the federal shield, and the purchasing power in the international market is stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
