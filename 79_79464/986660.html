			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before you came, I had already called Mr. Doolin!", Selem came out from the small room next door, he Standing in the porch, it is filled with shareholders of the seven casinos in Otis and members of the Otis business group, all of whom are solid supporters of Doolin. They used their own support for Doolin to exchange a lot of wealth, and many people's wealth has multiplied several times in this year, even dozens of times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They won’t forget Doolin and will not use Doolin as an enemy, because according to Doolin’s plan, their wealth will be in the next few years. Will continue to grow exponentially! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the Otis package is successfully implemented, their personal wealth will be at least tripled or even five times, which is equivalent to their wealth a year ago. Dozens of times or even hundreds of times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not counting, as the eastern canyon accident is over, the joint construction will start construction again. It is expected to penetrate the mountains in the middle of this year and will be open to traffic early next year. . The last short board of the city of Otis will also be filled, ushered in a new huge take-off, and their wealth will continue to grow significantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it’s just a fruit dealer, as long as they follow Du Lin’s footsteps in the first place, I’m afraid there are hundreds of thousands of net worth now, let alone those Speculators who have a lot of money to invest in their homes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of capitalists can trample on the law, in order to hundreds of times the interests of hundreds of capitalists, even the gods dare to kill you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman and Du Lin just said that the current situation in Otis is very bad. Every night there are gunshots and even gun battles, in the casino. The guests have not seen many people because of the drastic drop in the security environment. It can be said that there are no guests. The city hall of Otis, which was newly formed by Donald, did not have a better way. The Otis business group made suggestions and protests, but they were all returned by Mayor Donald. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the words of Mayor Donald, when the law is well, he will handle other things and will definitely return the city of Otis to its original state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As everyone knows, this is impossible. What he needs to do now is not to deal with the security issues that are always handled unclean, nor to think about using His own policy agenda and ideas overshadowed Doolin's rules, but bowed to Doolin. As long as he confessed his mistakes to Doolin and fought for Doolin's forgiveness, he only needed a phone call and the city of Otis would be restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn't do that. He seemed to be with Du Lin. When he was a member of Parliament, he didn't have these signs. He could only say that the power of this thing is so tempting that people forget their ability and only believe that they see it. That is what you can control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speaker is currently a director of the Otis City Business Group, and can also be regarded as one of the largest capitalist representatives in Otis, he and Du Lin The relationship is good, it is the first batch of merchants who came here to invest in the corresponding Otis City investment plan. For Du Lin’s smuggling miracle created on the East Coast, he believed that Du Lin could create another miracle in this desert. At that time, he came here with his own family of more than four million, and all of them were pressed down. Now In exchange for more than 50 million returns, so he called Du Lin, he also believes that only Duolin's law is the best choice for the continued development of the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seilem, the businessman who dares to speculate, he looks at all the people in the room and whispers: "Mr. Doolin told me that he I have already done what he should do. Next, we will choose it by ourselves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does this mean?", someone can't understand this sentence. Then, stand up and ask: "We have chosen to stand on the side of Mr. Doolin. What else do we need to choose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with some people Ignorance, others were deep-eyed, and they looked at each other and heard the meaning of Doolin from the words of Selem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin provided the direction and completed all the previous work, and then it was time for them to demonstrate their own interests and desires. They need to show their absolute sincerity and prove that they and Du Lin will always stand together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took them to make money, took them from the hands of tourists from all over the world, and already did what they were supposed to do, and completed their own work for everyone. committed to. But if you want to further develop the relationship between the two sides, then it is not simply to earn your own money, they also need to show their sincerity and show their position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you show your sincerity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get Donald off the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they have been passive responses, and have no initiative, it is simple and simple, that is, Du Lin has been maintaining their interests. They are only waiting for the results, without paying the slightest. Any income must have a relative contribution. In order to get something in this world, there must be equal pay. The result of the harvest is not because the things are falling from the sky, but by their own efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the room was a bit awe-inspiring. Selem smiled and clap his hands, which attracted everyone's attention. "I don't think we have shown the effort we should make to protect our own interests during this time, so I There is an idea. In the next period of time, we need to take the initiative to take the initiative to show more resistance and determination to the current unreasonable policies of the City Hall. Only in this way can we ensure that our interests are always in our wallets. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a certain risk here. After all, it is very difficult to completely offend the City Hall for some of you. I will not force anyone to stay in time. Engage with us all, if someone wants to quit, it’s still too late!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serlem’s words immediately let these treacherous businessmen Understood the meaning of his words, this is to let them fully declare war with the city hall, thus forcing Donald to resign and win the war. What time is this time to quit? Donald himself is obviously difficult to protect himself. If he is separated from the business group, he will definitely become the first "sacrifice" after the results appear. The silence of everyone seemed to unify the proposal of Selem, waiting for what Selem would say next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded. "Very good, I have an idea..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;third Every day, Donald was awakened by the ringing of his phone. After he called the phone for more than ten seconds, he turned to the window and opened the curtains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of local citizens outside the window and workers from other places held banners and signs, shouting a unified slogan passing by the door of his villa, not far away On the town hall square, there were a large number of demonstrators gathering. Their slogan is only one - still work! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing in any city is always employment. There are no more important political factors than this, even if one place is poor and backward. As long as there is enough work in this place, even if life is very embarrassing, people will take the initiative to adapt to such a life. But if there are not enough jobs, law and order, social environment, investment environment, and economic construction will become shit! Those who lose their work violent will destroy everything they see and let the authorities fall into great trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald slammed down on the bed and sat on the other side with his body. He picked up the phone and had sweat on his head. Asked: "What is going on in the ground? Why didn't anyone tell me that they want to hold a parade, and what do these people mean by holding the sign?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Police Commissioner Singh was helpless and said that these people did not submit any applications for the march to the police station. It can be said that their march was completely illegal, but the number of people marching was so much that their police station could not stop the crackdown. I am afraid that it is too late to apply for the army from the Imperial Police District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why there is such a slogan, Singh can only give a message that Donald is chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 9 o'clock last night, all members of the Otis Business Group, including the seven major casinos, officially announced an indefinite termination of business, owing to the ruin of Mayor Donald’s deliberate destruction The various relations of urban harmony have caused social turmoil and have had a great impact, causing huge losses to the members of the business group of Otis. In order to temporarily stop the loss, more than 70% of the capitalists in the city of Otis announced the termination of business activities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, they don’t play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the 270,000 jobs in the city of Otis disappeared and replaced by 270,000 "unemployed" people. This huge grievance has formed. Such a sudden parade. Of course, this parade can be understood as sudden, after all, it happens suddenly. This is the sight that Donald has seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed the phone and put on his clothes in a mess, went to the study room and called the directors of the seven major casinos, no matter who he called No one answered, just like these phones are empty. It wasn't until he called the phone of Thurem that he was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After answering his call, it means that there is still room for mitigation, but even so, he has hated these people. After this incident, no matter what he is doing in the future, he will not take up the main position again, and at most he will mix the unemployed positions in the party without power. This parade can be said to have ruined his political career, but if he does nothing, he may not even have a "destroyed political career." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seilem, why this thing will become like this, why can't we sit down and talk about it, can we let those outside people return to them first? Where did you go?", Donald's tone has softened a lot more than the days he just took office, and his voice is even mixed with meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Thurem has not changed. "Respected Mayor Donald, this is not what we caused, it was made by you. You can’t accept us. The advice has hurt everyone's heart. Given your trust in the Chamber of Commerce members, you can say these things to the Chamber members. I believe that with the capabilities of the Imperial Chamber of Commerce, they can help you solve the current predicament. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
