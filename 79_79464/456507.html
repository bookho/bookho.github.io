			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin walked into the dark world of the warehouse from the sun, and the Huon family finally saw who the people came in. Hu En was obviously loose. In one breath, his wife and daughter also seemed to relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The script is wrong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the script is quite right. When Hu Engang returned to his dilapidated little house, a group of teenagers rushed like a wolf, and they took it in their hands. With a sharp knife, they were subdued and covered with hands and feet, and they were given a black hood. At the moment when the black opaque headgear fell to cover his sight, he thought of the past, thought of the present, and fantasizing about the future, because he felt that he might not live long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huen is older and has a rich experience. He knows that only two people will use these black opaque headbands. The first is the bailiff, who will bring the hood to the prisoner, put on the heavy ankles, then hang the noose around their necks and finally push the handle. It is said that people can hear the sound of their neck break before they die, and then slowly enter the death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another kind of person is a gang. When a gang puts a black headgear on someone's head, it means that the person was sentenced to death by the gang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official use of black hoods for prisoners is because in the Lord's Scriptures, when a person dies, his soul will be attached to the last one to see and let him The body of a person with strong hatred is lingering. Being possessed by such evil spirits will not only cause illness in the body, but also bring bad luck. Therefore, when the official execution of the death penalty, they will wear headscarves for the death penalty, so that they can not entangle an innocent person with a foolish identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gangs use black hoods to make their opponents die more shameful and more disrespectful. The gangs pay more attention to the personal reputation and glory than people think, and any dishonorable death is a great humiliation for the gang. It is obviously also very disrespectful to bring the black hood with the "death of who kills you, you don't know". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Hu En thinks that this group of teenagers should be Morris’s men. They came to arrest themselves and were also instructed by Morris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and shook his head. This may be the gap between people? ! If the person who is present is Morris, Huen should cry and confess his own wrong behavior, and beg for Morris's forgiveness, because he knows that Morris is likely to do it to him and his family. What can be seen is that when he was in Du Lin, Hu En was relieved. Is it because he thought Du Lin was a good person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a good person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stumbled and ordered a cigarette for himself. Since he came to the city, he quickly learned to smoke. In fact, he still has no cigarette addiction. He smoked, part of it was influenced by Mr. Ke Ma, and part of it was influenced by the guy in the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cigarette butt was ignited and gave off a dazzling fire. Du Lin took a sip and spit it out of his mouth after the circulation of the lungs. He licked it. Slightly dry lips, "I don't like trouble." He said that he smiled and looked at the internal structure of the No. 10 warehouse. He said, "From a very young age, I didn't like trouble. I I don't like to trouble people, and I don't like people to trouble me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Huen, you have caused a big problem for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Huen’s mouth squirmed for a moment before he spit out a sorry message, “I don’t want Mr. Doolin like this, but if I don’t do this, Morris’s people won’t Let me leave, I can't lose my wife and my daughter. For them, I can only deceive Morris. If Morris is in trouble, you can ask him to come to me. I still have a thousand here. One hundred, I don’t owe him much, and I can return it to my relatives and borrow it completely!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need!", Du Lin shook his head and said: "Morris has gone to hell to confess, and then you are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood up and walked back and forth a few steps. "To be honest, I can hardly believe that I will say this now, but I have been hesitant." The kindness has made me lose a lot of money, and I almost got into danger, so..." Du Lin smiled apologetically. "I am sorry that Mr. Huen, as the president of the fellowship, As a less formal private drinker, I can only say sorry, my status, my identity does not allow me to have a second stupidity, if there is a chance, we will see you in heaven!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin put the cigarette butt in his hand on Huen’s head, Hu’en suddenly burst into a painful cry, and Du Lin said after laughing, “Hey, I The kind heart is in chaos, and you liar can not go to heaven, then go to hell and wait for me!", When finished, Herr turned away, not because of Hoon's pray for the slightest stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the warehouse, Du Lin licked the hoe, and the Buddha immediately came together. He told a few words and left. There are so many things waiting for him, he can't waste too much time here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the Buddha gave a few teenagers to pick up two wooden barrels. These barrels are used to hold wine, and each barrel can hold at least seventy-five gallons of wine, which is more than enough for people to wear. Several people entered the warehouse with their wooden barrels. Huen looked at the group of teenagers and immediately pleaded. "Please, let me see Mr. Doolin. I didn't lie to him. I really sold the ranch." He, and even if I was in trouble, Morris came to me for trouble, not Mr. Doolin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha raised his feet and squatted at Hu On the face of En, "Morris Morris first went to hell and mixed with the demons. Since you want to explain this clearly, go to hell and Morris the dead ghost.", said he from the side I didn’t have time to pick up a stick in the construction waste that had been dumped, and knocked it on Hu’s head. Huen’s whole person was twitching and squashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha said as he smiled, he touched the little girl’s head and revealed a sunny smile. In addition, as a guar, the three-dimensional more three-dimensional, and his handsome, so that the little girl temporarily forgot the fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Afraid of black? It doesn't matter, your mother will be with you, as long as you endure it!", he said that he looked at Hu again. Grace's wife, "I am sorry for my wife, for whatever reason, I believe that I can't ask for your forgiveness. If your husband wants to go to hell, then you will definitely go to heaven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stick fell behind the woman’s head, and her body moved forward and sat down. The little girl has not escaped this, and perhaps leaving the world in a coma is the last kindness that Du Lin left for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put him in this bucket, put them in another one, then quit and pour the mud to the mouth and throw it into the agate river."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the movement of the children, Hu En and his wife and daughter were put into two wine barrels respectively, and then poured into a thick and sticky The mud was sealed and rivets were placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps no one will find a liar hidden in these two barrels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
