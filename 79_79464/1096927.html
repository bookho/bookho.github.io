			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a clear purpose for any occurrence, even if it is a madman, he has his own purpose when doing one thing. The more sane people, the stronger the group, the stronger their purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal laissez-faire risk. In addition to self-confidence to ensure the security of the financial order, the core interests are always free of the idea of ​​exporting the country's reputation. Money, besides being a manifestation of purchasing power, is a kind of commodity in circulation, it can also be a manifestation of the power of a country. If you want more countries in the world to recognize the federal shield, then you first need to make these countries aware of the strong economic and military power that cannot be ignored. The economy is an important part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When those countries are still in post-war economic reconstruction, or long-term economic downturn, there is such a country in this world, it is very powerful, and the economy is very developed. Every country in this country is making money, every citizen is benefiting, so what reason is there for the country being shown to oppose aid from the federal government? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People always look forward to good things, the Federation is creating a special atmosphere, wants to let all countries understand that this is a strong country! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A country full of ambitions will definitely ignore something selectively, which is exactly the way Dulin operates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issuance of the currency was completed at the end of October, and Du Lin made a good sum of money. The easiest way to get more economic benefits when you have internal news is to put your money into the financial market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a week of weekends, Du Lin finally reached a very special person, and the gentleman was also helped by Mr. Kaile. Mr. Keller has a very deep personal relationship with the empire and the federal high-level. He has more ways to find opportunities for Du Lin than other people, such as Mr. Jack, to meet with a senior member of the Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place they met was on the outskirts of another city with a resort. Rich federal people are very happy to enjoy, their activities are much more than the activities of the empire, and more interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quiet resort is hidden in a valley, only to see the lush mountains from the outside, but as the car drives from a path into the valley, the original narrow The road is instantly wide open, and the scenery is beautiful enough to make people suffocate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The verdant valley is surrounded by a verdant meadow. There is a building that looks very simple in the east of the valley. It is a bit like a forest house with a strange and poetic style. It is simple and simple, and full of countryside. Leisure. Next to this building is a huge lake. There are many fish swimming in the crystal clear waters. There are several boats floating on the lake. Some of them are sitting on the boat with some hats. Or lady, enjoying the fun of fishing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a place full of rural flavors, everything looks so primitive, but don't have a taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person with Du Lin is the driver of the gentleman that Du Lin wants to meet. If there is no referral in this place, he will not be able to enter. There seem to be a lot of sentry posts on the valley trails that don't seem to have any access control. If the car was not registered, they were already stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Waiting for you in Zone 2, you have thirty minutes!", the driver opened the door for Doolin and pointed out that he was going The place, after Du Lindao Xie, sorted out his dress and walked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he has only one person, but Savi and Dufo have already infiltrated the nearby mountains, and if the situation is not right, they can immediately come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second district is just an abbreviation of a building, more like the resort's second villa, but there are no multi-storey villas, all are bungalows. The old-fashioned house with bark wood makes no resentment for anyone, but because it fits well with the environment here, there is a return to nature. He stood outside the door of Zone 2 and pressed the doorbell. After a while, a steward-like old gentleman opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seriously and rigorously examined Du Lin, with a smile on his serious face. "Mr. Du Lin, good afternoon, if you don't mind, I hope." You can check the personal items you carry with you." He said it was very polite, and Du Lin knew that he would encounter such a situation and naturally spread his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler searched quickly, but also very carefully, did not miss any place, about a minute or two later, he led Du Lin into the door, then Passing through three rooms, on the platform next to the lake, I saw the people that Du Lin wanted to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old man is facing him, holding a fishing rod in his hand, and watching the movement of the water in a very focused manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks like he is about seventy years old, and he has some age spots on his face. The loose skin hangs down and has a little bloated feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not speak, he sat down with the old man, and the old man did not see him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are staring at the surface of the water. Under the surface of the water, some fish can be seen to swim around the bait. From time to time, tentatively touch the bait, not immediately. Just bite the hook. This kind of calm lasted for about ten or twenty minutes. A fish swallowed the bait, and the old man quickly lifted the fish. After a brief contest, the fish was pulled out of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you eat fish?", the old man asked while picking the hook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and said, "I like to eat fish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man solved it The fish was put into the fishing rod and waved at the butler. "I ate this at night..." After he finished collecting the fish and fish line, he looked back at the butler and said, "Don't let anyone bother me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After watching the housekeeper leave, the old talents look to Du Lin, "I heard that you contacted me through many aspects. What do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood up and bowed," Dear Federal Speaker, I have brought destruction and new hopes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old man is the Speaker of the Federal Joint Parliament, according to the current The rules and regulations of the parliament, all the speakers are lifelong, in order to prevent their power from being taken away by others. They built this country and gave it strength and prosperity. No one can take everything away without their permission, so they made this rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man laughed and was full of energy. "Your statement is exaggerated. This is not a happy statement, but you have caused my curiosity, you What kind of destruction, what kind of hope?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am afraid that my time is not enough to make it clear.", Du Lin glanced at the watch. There are only a few minutes left in the half an hour agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
