			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave’s existence is definitely a huge “vulnerability”. Doolin himself has not talked about love, nor does he know whether people who are in love are like books. It is as irrational as it is said. He dare not gamble on his own life safety and the safety of his child's life. If Dave wants to be disgusted or retaliate against Alisa or himself, he only needs to reveal a little bit of tone. Maybe you can let the guy named Amp grab his tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He inquired Kevin about Amp, Kevin’s reply to him is very simple, it is a "Kevin" standing in the official position, they The same smart, the same reason. Kevin won't touch the case that Amp caught, and the same case that Kevin caught in the case will not be touched. The two have already handed over in secret, and they have a preliminary understanding of each other. Kevin gave Du Lin a piece of advice. If anything involves Amp's body, or if he doesn't do it, he must do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin can't ignore this risk, even if Alisa would hate him, but he cares? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't care! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing he cares about is his own child. When he knows his own flesh hidden in Alisa’s belly, he can feel it faintly. The child has a strong heartbeat. He knows that this is an illusion, but this illusion is so fascinating! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning home, he thought for a while, then picked up the phone and called the East City branch of the Ternell area, and contacted Mason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor’s use of the opportunity of the Golden Robbery directly identified the delay in the warfare. The Tenel Regional Police Department had the primary responsibility, plus Prando at the dock. Was shot, the governor directly airborne a new party police chief into the Tyrell, and the newly appointed Director of the Bureau of Confessional Investigations helped each other and successfully gave the new party the most powerful blow to the hard end of the old party. Prando’s police officers who have served for more than a year have been quarantined and they have been dug out of their mouths about a lot of unbelievable things about Prando. This has successfully resisted the counterattack from the old party. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original City Hall also intends to give Prando an imperial third-class heroic medal to recognize the contribution he made to the security of the city of Tener when he was alive, but unfortunately this The medal has not yet been issued, Prando’s assets have been frozen, the house has been taken back, and his wife and children have been driven outside. In the words of the director of the State Guard Bureau, if we give a medal to remember the memory of the people's heroes to a corrupt person, this is the shame of Tener, and it is the shame of Cannes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, some young police officers who have entered the police station and passed the examination have been reused to varying degrees. Among them, Du Lin’s brother Mason was reused for two reasons. First, he did not receive a penny of money and bribes during his tenure as director of the Dongcheng Branch. This is very rare. Second, when his younger brother Du Lin was arrested and monitored and interrogated, Mason was also involved. Instead of engaging in malpractices, he constantly persuaded Doolin to confess his crimes and was willing to punish his judge for his confession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two points that prove that Mason is an excellent policeman. Although he has not been promoted, it has meant that he has not been transferred during such a period. The value has been improved, and there are even rumors that the Tenel Regional Police Department will add two deputy directors to assist the director to carry out daily work, one of which is his position! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brother, I need you to do something for me." Du Lin just spoke a word and was interrupted by Mason’s complaint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, you still know to call me, do you know how much I worry about you during this time? You guys are too courageous, I Be sure to tell your father, he must give you a good lesson!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled a few times. "These complaints can wait for us to meet you." Said to me face to face!", as soon as he spoke, the microphone was in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Mason is now a little scared of Du Lin, which is completely against them when they are at home, because he is still the director of the branch, so he can read a lot. The file, which includes the file of the gold robbery. Du Lin killed a lot of people this time, and many people died because of this case. He didn't think that the guy who was wandering behind his ass all day in his hometown could do something like this. So he was a little scared of Du Lin. He hasn't hurt anyone yet, but Du Lin has already started killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Mason’s voice was heard in the receiver. “Say, what do you want me to do?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let my father come to you, I need to talk to him directly, I will call you again tomorrow morning, goodbye!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After hanging up the phone, Du Lin was relieved. He also raised seven armed militia in his hometown. He planned to call these people to temporarily protect Alisa and her children. This time, Alisa came to Irian, and maybe she would fall into the eyes of a caring person, even if she really just wanted to travel. In order to avoid possible problems, Du Lin believes that it is always much more sensible to prevent in advance than afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, if all the money is spent, it should also play a role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning at 8:00 am, Du Lin called the Teel Dongcheng branch again on time. This time it was his father, Kesi. Mr. Ma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Wexma!", the sound in the earpiece was a little distorted, but the stereotyped sound was branded in the body of Doolin as a brand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, I am Doolin, I have something to say to you, you may be the third in the family within three months." Generation members, but the little guy needs human protection now. Remember the good armed militia we said? I hope they can protect the child within three months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Du Lin heard the sound of a chair falling, and Mason’s pleading voice, very kind. The sound in the microphone is still as rigid as before, but Du Lin can hear something trembled from it. "Time, place, name, who should I guard against?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The specific information Mason knows, the girl is called Alisa, it is best not to let her know, of course, it does not matter. After the child is born, take the child back and raise it for me. I have a lot of things to do now, maybe I don't have time to look after the child, I can only bother you. I hope that the child will not be subjected to any pampering and connivance. Treating him is like treating you like this. If you have nothing, just take a few whip."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you saying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin, who had already brewed some feelings, was stunned by this sentence, he smashed two Sentence, the face hangs up the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma took a thicker lap than the one sold in the store, and grew a little cigarette, which was his own tobacco and himself Volume, he glanced at Mason standing in the corner of his arm and snorted. "It’s so useless to be so big, you are a role model for your younger siblings!", said that he left the police station directly. Mason didn't send him. He kept licking his arm. Just before Mr. Kesma, who was talking, originally held his arm and suddenly pinched it. He suspected that his meat was crushed and immediately purple. Swollen up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Xerma returned home by car and sat on the easy chair outside the door and thought about it for a long time. It was not until Mrs. Kesma came out to ask him to dine, that he retired from his own world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
