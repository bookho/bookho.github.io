			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things are ready, only owe the wind, this is a saying in the world... but not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, Du Lin has adjusted the state, and the next development may be particularly thrilling in the future textbooks, so that even the readers are I squeezed a sweat, but he is really calm now, except for the deepest desire in the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is no problem, then I will start." On the phone, Du Lin confirmed it again, and these people of the nationality, they have already Considered for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a dilemma for them. If you choose to stop Doolin, there is no doubt that the day when the federal shield becomes the international settlement currency, It is the beginning of the "hot fight" that the new and old forces of the Federation have torn apart. In order to protect the power in their hands, in order to return the power to the people who really need it, the battle between the founding of the nationality and the new consortium will be extremely fierce. It is even possible that these rulers will become the new king and lift the scepter to the throne. Ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what they don’t want to see. They have ruled the country for hundreds of years. The factor of being a ruler has broken into the bone marrow. Every generation is born. When they are sensible, they will be told by their elders that they are the supreme powers of the country, to inherit some of these powers, and to pass on their powers for generations to come, forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risks are too great now, and these people are already uncertain about whether they can restrict the rush of the new consortium’s scepter in their hands. The more they stop, the more cruel they are, the more eager they are to gain power. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if done, and Du Lin colluded to destroy these new consortia, then the federal economy will go back at least ten years, even twenty years, and So there is a lot of turmoil, and a civil war may occur. But they have thus stabilized their power and shattered all the people in society who can challenge themselves and the forces. The reshuffled social class will bring their stable rule to at least two hundred years of centralized power. They can maximize their own ideas and plan this new country, making it less aggressive than it is now. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this treason? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this is a restart. This is the redistribution of social resources. Almost everyone will return to nothing at night, and it seems that they have suffered disasters and financial disasters. But for many people, this also means an unprecedented opportunity. The resources of society are returning to the society from the pockets of the solidified class. As long as you have the courage and ability, it is not difficult to become a new aristocrat. There is no stubborn and unbreakable class, no rules that are restricted everywhere. This is definitely a brand new world. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose to hand over power, and then suddenly withdraw from the political arena, or restart the country, let everything return to the most simple era, the choice is in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earpiece was silent for a long time before the voice that Doolin needed. "Yes, we have made a decision and will cooperate with you comprehensively." They used the word "you". They already knew that this was not a plan for Du Lin alone. There were many participants, and even... some of them unexpectedly participated. "The gentlemen, on November 23, Shenhui will sprinkle this land!" Did not move, pondered for a while before shaking his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was preparing to turn around to arrange things, but he accidentally saw Natiya coming down from the car that had just entered the manor, and he frowned slightly. Some time ago, when Du Lin sent Natiya back, she told her that she would not come back for a while and handle her affairs with ease. By the way, she could go to the west and feel the "West of Doolin". Beautiful view. Doolin knows that there will be a long period of escape, and at least he will be able to return to China after the federal diplomatic pressure has passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had planned to travel with Natiya in his original plan, but then thought about it, it is not a reality to take a woman. When he said that he was traveling, he actually fled. In the face of the federal pursuit and the uncertain positions of various countries, this trip will not be so leisurely. So when he sent Natiya back, he told her not to come again, but now she is coming again, this is a trouble, he does not like trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the study, Du Lin asked Natiya to call the study. When the door was closed, Du Lin asked, "I don't mean I don't need to come back. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natiya sighed and answered, "I am divorced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Du Lin’s face was astonished. “Divorce? It’s terrible!” In fact, he already knew it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After going back, Natiya did not quarrel with Walter, more like a peaceful breakup. Maybe Walter also understood how stupid things he did, so there is no Noisy, he knows that noisy can't change the ending. If you can't do it, why don't you look a little more generous, gentleman, and more peaceful say goodbye? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then three people sat together and signed the divorce agreement. From that moment, Walter was free. He went after his love, just like he was Natiya finally said. He found the passion that he once had in that girl, and that kind of bloody day consumes all the energy and time for a stupid thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is love, once they have had it...maybe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya is also exceptionally calm. After signing the divorce agreement, she did not give anything to Walt. Walter did not ask for anything, and then left with the girl. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sudden divorce, Natiya has a bit of inexplicable grief, and there is a bit of inexplicable desire to laugh, laughing at herself stupid, laughing at Walter absurd, laughing at the world A stupid group of fools full of horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she thought of coming back, she was not sure if a person went to the west is a correct decision, I heard that the law and order in the west is not very good, simple The western people liked to greet guests with fast-rotating metal bullets. Finally, they chose to come to the federation. Maybe Du Lin had other things to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she is here, facing Du Lin, she sighed again, but the mood is not so sad, "This is actually a piece of Good things, you don't understand. We haven't lived together for 12 years. Maybe I was pregnant for the longest time. The work of the South Bank can't be lost. I always go to the West. Running, getting in less time, maybe that's why I feel sad, but I don't think so sad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought when I made In this final decision, a knife will be inserted into my chest, letting my soul die for a while, but it is actually not like that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin Asked in an uncertain tone, "So, is this really a good thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Who knows?” Natiya shook her head and smiled a little. “Maybe it’s just a little bit reluctant, because everyone will feel that they are the best, they should have everything, and finally they find that they just have There is no shadow, coldly watching him lie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When we are at such a age, is there really love in addition to impulsiveness?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin squinted at his eyes, he realized a question, is everyone saying something philosophical after being hurt? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I will give you a holiday, you can go around and relax, wait for you to feel relieved, we are discussing work. "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natiya suddenly looked up at Du Lin and asked, "Is this pity, because you think I am poor?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, because the next is very dangerous.", Doolin did not say anything to cover up the truth of the facts, sometimes he was very strange, some people made a fortune but did not dare Tell the family, but are willing to share with friends. Some people have gained a great power for some reason, never telling the truth to the people around them, but they are very generous in demonstrating their strength to those who don’t know. Of course, they will use their family members to accept the facts or fear that the people around them will be surprised by their own changes, so that they can only fool their own reasons to condone their conscience. But Du Lin has always been a sincere person, he never lie... maybe Let's go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will attack the federal financial market, which will make me a target that many people must remove, so I will face many kills soon. "You will interfere with my escape here." Du Lin directly said the reason and ordered a cigarette. "I don't want to disrupt my plan because of an extra-planned person. Do you understand what I mean? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Natya, I thought of Walter’s look at the girl’s expression, and suddenly there was an impulsive impulse in her heart that made her own. I can't help but say something that hasn't been considered by the brain. "I want to be with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, she realized that she was stupid. Then, I laughed. "I didn't say anything wrong. I am at an age like me. I may only have an impulse, and sometimes I have more impulses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
