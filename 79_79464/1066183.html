			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't look so good!" Du Lin took a sip of iced juice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The east coast has entered the summer mode, the temperature is around 23 degrees, enough to make people wear a little cool clothes to run on the beach. Passengers from all over the world once again appeared on the streets of Irian, allowing the city to recover quickly from the winter break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm sunshine, the pleasant temperature, the cool sea breeze blowing from time to time, as long as you stand on the street, you can have a relaxed mood. The fascinating girls and handsome boys on the streets are everywhere, and it’s a paradise for vacation! At this time, Nasha’s face was surprisingly ugly. She glanced at Du Lin. “Do you think I can be happy now? Still think I should It’s awesome to say that you pushed me to the edge of the cliff?” Nasha’s temperament was not small, and she finally made a certain achievement in her industry. As a result, Du Lin’s bastard had to pick it up and marry her. Rice bowl. She wondered if she had a hatred with Du Lin, why this bastard always came to destroy his most proud things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and put the drink down, watching Nasha angry, he thought it was very interesting, for a while Nasha always came to him for trouble, now it is his turn Come to revenge, "We are friends, don't you think that cable TV is great?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have anything to do with me?", Nasha's white A look at Du Lin, but then Du Lin’s words let her witness the dog... stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course!", Doolin shrugged his shoulders. "Upper last time, I remember telling you that I will give you a chance. Now this opportunity is coming." That time, Doolin needed to have a breakthrough in the print media to make him speak, let more middle class know the "truth" of things, and this is also a very dangerous thing. It is said that the retaliation is too low-level, and it is said that this political event involving the position will be tagged when it comes in, thus affecting the operation of Nasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Nasha helped Du Lin, helpless with reckless help, so he said, gave Nasha a chance to participate in cable TV production. Opportunity. In Du Lin's view, there are no large companies like the tape content provider companies, and most of them are production content production companies. Even the TV station Dooling is not going to leave it. He owns all the patents on cable TV. Why should he let the TV station give it to others? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, he was the only TV station in the empire, and the other people were content providers, and then divided by advertising business. In other words, as long as the advertising revenue appearing on the TV in the future, there is a copy of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Doolin idea was ten channels, seven of which were Doolin’s own, and three channels he planned to give to Nasha. On the one hand, his energy cannot be placed on the production of TV content, which deviates from his original intention, and secondly to avoid someone suing him for monopoly industry by anti-monopoly law. He only accounts for 70% of the industry, and will dilute his own proportion in the industry over time, it is impossible to monopolize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said to her own thoughts and Nasha, Nasha suddenly became a little embarrassed, after all, she just said Du Lin, and at the same time I think the Duolin people are still good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what do I need to do now?", Nasha’s emotions have calmed down and immediately entered the role, “When can I see cable TV? Can you help me with the help of Dolin Cable TV? It is also a huge attraction for Nasha. Now she has nothing, only these industries, and a dream of reviving the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded, which is why he was coming to meet with Jonathan. Cable TV is no matter how good it is. It also needs to have a promotion platform to promote it, so that more people can understand this thing before they can talk about sales. Under normal circumstances, it is obviously a very good channel to make advertisements through newspapers. After all, the audience of the newspapers is very light, and the reading volume and sales volume are also very good, but at the same time there are some problems. Because the newspaper is still a traditional paper medium, it is difficult to achieve a shocking effect through one or two promotional color pages or simple text descriptions. Therefore, Du Lin needs a visual medium to promote cable TV. This medium is tape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only those who are used to wearing tape can understand the value and scarcity of cable TV and be attracted to cable TV. This part of the user is likely to be transformed into the first user of cable TV immediately after the official promotion of cable TV. Therefore, Du Lin hopes to promote the cable TV with the Empire Star and the Star Empire in Nasa. To tie in with the conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no good care for Nasha, and he nodded directly and agreed to it. Anyway, he was the one who benefited from it. It was internal cooperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next, I may need some help from you. I plan to set up a content provider. You know that I have acquired the creative team of many bankrupt tape companies. These people will provide content for future TV programs. But I am again. There is no time to manage this content, so I think we have cross-shareholdings and you are directly involved in the day-to-day management of our company as the second largest shareholder.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nashua looked at Du Lin for a while, then shook his head and said, "I finally understand why you succeeded." She sighed with a sigh of relief. "Because you are thick." Shameless, I have a question I want to ask you, if I didn't help you at the time, what are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to hear the truth?", Du Lin took out a cigarette, and Nasha nodded. "If there is no such cooperation, I will talk to you after the tape market collapses. My idea is that the two companies in your hand are on the exchange. 2% of the shares are incorporated into the cable company, then you Continue to work for me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this answer, Nasha gave a high-level evaluation of “shamelessness”, and at the same time, she also had some luck and felt more. It’s terrible to Doolin. The company in her hands was sold to her by Dooling at a high price, then she was beaten and re-acquired at a very low price, or the kind that did not give money, and then let her work for Du Lin. I have never seen such a bully, it is a qualified capitalist! If it really happened that day, Nasha didn't know if she would agree to Doolin's request and continue to work for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He destroyed the George family and destroyed the foundation of his own family, and he has to work for him again, is it possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe maybe, because at that time Nasha had nothing to lose, even Nasha had already thought of more business models, such as after the movie It can be broadcast directly through cable TV. The audience only needs to pay an additional on-demand fee to be able to watch movies with their family at home. If so, the theaters in his hands will not have any good improvement in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Knowing you is the beginning of my bad luck!" Nasha praised it sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sighed slightly and nodded, "Thank you for your compliment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two look at each other With a smile, I started to discuss the conference and the next cable TV work, they seem to have forgotten something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I forgot that there is another girl named Kinsale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Doolin’s ten dollars, Kinsale wandered around in Irian, the city was rated as the most livable city and not a virtual name. . This of course praises the attitude of the local city hall to the tramp and industry. They sent the industry directly to the sixth district more than 20 kilometers away. The pollution produced by industrial production will not affect the residential area of ​​Irian and be clean. A tramp on the neat street can't be seen, there are beautiful scenery everywhere, so many people come here once, it will have the idea of ​​settle here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the completion of the eighth district, Irian has almost become one of the must-see cities for tourism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, this lady, want to be a movie star?", just as Kinsale lingers in those exquisite craft shops, a tall and handsome The man appeared at Kinsale's side. He had a hand in front of him, a polite smile on his face, and a little expensive dress made him look like a bad guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kinsale turned to look at him and pointed to himself, "Are you talking to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handsome man nodded. "Yes, beautiful lady, I am the scout of Piaget Films, the kind of young man who looks for stars in the street, and People who help them realize their dreams. How do you have a dream of becoming a star?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ginselton has an interest, "Yes, I want to be a star, what should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked around the crowd and pulled Kinsale out of the door, "We are going It’s said that there are so many people here!” Faced with a strange man pulling his hand Jinsel did not resist, she was full of brains and wanted to be a star. Nothing is more than a star. Can attract her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two left the craft store, found a slightly remote place on the street, sat on the bench, the man began to introduce himself, "I Call Jim, I just said, I am the scout of Piaget, this is my business card, there is my contact information. I think that you are very suitable for a movie, you have a good look and body, if you don’t go When a star is a waste of your talent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
