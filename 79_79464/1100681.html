			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six warships of the Irian Naval Base left Portor at the same time and alerted Holdenton. He did not know what happened and immediately returned the news to the Governor, Governor. Also reported to the cabinet. In fact, the quiet and good things of the Navy and the Ministry of National Defense have not been revealed. This actually involves many aspects of compromise, especially those senior naval generals who have been expelled because of "fear of war". They are now ships. Like the king or the sea tycoon, their interests and the interests of the navy are holistic. If you rush to publish the news, it may cause some other changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s better to sneak in this way, as long as the Navy abides by the agreement and is willing to defend the country, then it’s fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability and mobility of Major General Thomas is still very high. On the morning of the next morning, Thomas called Doolin and told him that he had sunk three. A freighter. Du Lin gave a high degree of appreciation for this attitude and action, and let them continue until they call him again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Thomas did not completely tell the truth, they did not sink the freighters when they met, they used their own transport ship to transfer the goods on the freighter, and then Then take the freighter and bring the boat to sink. People who often run at sea have a certain degree of understanding of warships in various countries. Even if the Imperial warships have been camouflaged to the greatest extent, they may still be seen. The best way is to let all the insiders shut up forever. . Of course, this pot of navy will not back, even if no one knows that they will not back, it is not the navy, the pirates, the pirates with the pirate flag that make such bad things. In fact, the Imperial Navy has always been dirty, and some of the warships that they scrapped each year were slightly modified and sent to the high seas to be dismissed during the Great Patriotic War. The companions, the soldiers who lost their military status and the middle and lower ranks are now famous pirates, active on the high seas, and are said to have become cancers on the high seas. It is a pity that this group of people is too strong and there are too many warships. If there is no question of principle, no country is willing to spend huge military expenses to encircle a group of pirates. As long as they are not too excessive, everyone will close their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are also moving, this kind of "dedication to robbery" is the first time to do a good job, there is a sense of freshness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the morning seems to be in contact with the embassy, ​​he was beaten by Du Lin and could not end this way, he could not swallow this bad smell. On the one hand, he needs to pressure Du Lin from the national level, let him understand that this slap is not so good, and on the other hand he also mobilized some people, he will not kill Du Lin, but he is going to get back to the field. , beat him up. When I was young, I didn’t even beat his parents. Someone even slapped him and hit him on the face. It’s a terrible feeling, and the end of the world is coming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is strongly asking the embassy to issue a formal diplomatic note to do this, and the people at the embassy are also very painful. They naturally attribute this to a fart-like thing like jealousy. Alan Duy is traversing in the country, but there is really no reputation in the world, except for money. For this little thing, we must use the national diplomatic force. The people at the embassy feel that this bastard is crazy. When Alan Duy did not rely on the coercion to lure the embassy, ​​his butler coughed behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced back and continued to snarl into the microphone. "As the most famous person in the country, I have been insulted. Don’t you feel ashamed? What people can't believe is that you actually..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler coughed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan Duy turned and looked at him. "You better give me an explanation. You know that I have a bad temper now. If you don't want to beat, it's best to say it." A reason why I won't hit you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler smiled and bowed his head. "Master, you have lost a few ships."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alandouy wouldn’t care so much if he said anything else, but he was especially interested in the ship because of all his powers today. And wealth comes from the monopoly of the country's international trade. If his ship goes out, it means not only that he needs to pay a sum of money to the merchants, but also suffers from the loss of the freighter itself, and may also cause a series of problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monopoly business is not easy to do, especially when monopolizing a country’s foreign trade, it is even worse. If you are not careful, the emerging capital forces and the royal family will pull him down. He must treat it all cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just hung up the phone, the whole person calmed down, and ordered a piece of the most authentic and pure land from the Federation, sucking two, "all "Tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He soon knew that the five freighters leaving the port last night and this morning had a few hours before and after, and they completely lost the news. There are high-power radio stations that are sufficient to reach some offices in the nearby coast, but they have not contacted the surrounding offices as long as they entered the high seas. Something happened before, maybe it was a problem with the radio station, or it might be that the staff was lazy and asleep. There has never been a concentrated outbreak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the phone and dialed a number and asked in front of the butler. "Do you know where my boat went?" The guy he called was the largest group of pirates outside Farolan, but others It is not clear that the leader of these pirates is actually the uncle who disappeared when he was a child. The prosperity of any monopoly trade must be accompanied by both positive and negative sides, expanding its own strength, and blocking the growth of others. With the pirate Alanduy's career booming, no one has ever challenged his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unclear, winter is not a good season, and we have nothing else to do for the time being. Why, your ship is missing?", in the receiver The voice was a little hoarse. Alan Duy’s uncle used some drugs to change his voice, causing his nephew to go wrong and avoid being discovered. “That’s really bad news, do you know where they are missing? I am going to look for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan Duy is uneasy after the call, he always feels that this is not so simple, but I can't think of what happened in the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For three consecutive days, twenty-one freighters disappeared without a trace, and even three pirate ships with inquiries about the news disappeared. There is a professional profession, and there is nothing in the far-off round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the boat can’t get out, Alain Dui has let the country suspend the next transportation plan, he has to figure out who is right with himself, and then put this The matter is solved. In the face of this kind of big trouble that can be said to have shaken him, Du Lin’s affairs have become insignificant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when he thought that Du Lin was a negligible person, someone gave him a message telling him that he wanted to solve it, then Look for Doolin. At the beginning, Alan Duy thought it was a scam until his family told him on the sixth day that a group of inexplicable pirates suddenly attacked his uncle on the high seas. At the base, his uncle and most of the pirates were shot and the warships were all sunk. The survivors think that the warships and fighting methods that are not commonly used by pirates are absolutely regular warships. Who heard that pirates still play volleys? Don't know if the shells are expensive? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that far, more than a dozen boats were completely finished after six rounds of the island. After more than 30 years, the pirate base was completely finished. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
