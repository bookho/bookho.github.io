The cigarette was handed to Doolin, and a lighter was used to order him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a sip of smoke and shook his head, spit out a smog, and said with confidence: "No, but they will promise!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not surprising that there is such a guess. There are some simple descriptions of Hu’en that Du Lin has a preliminary understanding of the good-hearted man named Morris. That is a guy who doesn't want to put a high profit on loan sharks, or that the society's loan sharks are not black enough to be saved. Morris is a gang member and he has some thugs. This kind of person is like a person in a dream called "water hose" in a gang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their task is to provide the gang with sufficient funds for development, and of course it is possible that this business is Morris' own. However, no matter how much he owes money, he definitely dare not pay back. Otherwise, when Morris takes his cow, he will stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was afraid of Morris, afraid that even if his interests were violated, he would not dare to protest. Such people may say something swearing under the great pressure, and there are some decisive ideas, but that is only their wishful thinking. If such a person uses the words in the dream, it is embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not dare to say that he was their only savior. There are still some gaps between the 1,800 and the two hundred and two hundred, but this gap can give They have enough hope. More than four hundred pieces? If you honestly make money, four hundred pieces may take two years to get together, and that their family of three needs a good job. But if you don't make money honestly, you can't get through the four hundred pieces in a short time. Huen is now faced with the choice of selling the ranch to Doolin and then trying to make up for four hundred or holding the ranch. With the family, the light will die, and then Doolin will buy the ranch from Morris's hand at a relatively cheap price. Why do you want to inquire about the money that Hu En owes? Isn't it just to wait for this family to die, and find the new owner of the ranch to buy it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Du Lin believes that even if he opens the price of 1,600, Morris will not refuse, because Morris is a "low-profit". Not a foundation, nor a risk-avoiding investment. What he needs is money, cash, and a star that can be used immediately for trading! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for how long the door of the house opened from the inside, Hu En walked out with a look of his face. He looked at Du Lin with a complex look and sighed. "You won the gentleman, one thousand eight hundred pieces, sold to you. Now, when can we get the money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took off the cigarette on his mouth, fell to the ground, stepped on a foot and grinded it Reaching out and saying: "The cooperation is pleasant. You will come to the city with your certificate tomorrow. After the formalities are completed, you can get your money. Now, I will not bother you to rest, leave!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and smiled away, and the premium of three hundred for the advantage of time, which is a fairly cost-effective deal. As for how the Huon family sold out the house tomorrow, how to get the remaining four hundred pieces, this has nothing to do with Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the city, the three suppliers told him the trustee. After a week, their first batch of 10,000 bottles will be transported here. Hope He is ready to receive the goods. In the early morning of the next day, Hu En took the proof of his farm land and found Du Lin who had only woke up for a long time. They went to Tener together. The land use office of the city transfers the registration of land assets. The formalities were not complicated. The two parties signed a contract for the sale and transfer. Hu En transferred Huon’s farm to Duolin for one thousand and eight hundred yuan at a price of one thousand and eight hundred yuan, and signed the fingerprint. After the document was held by one person and the land use office also filed a copy, the land was Doolin. Du Lin gave Huns one thousand and eight hundred pieces in front of him, and asked Hu En to sign a receipt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Huen’s quick departure from the office lobby, Du Lin hooked his finger and immediately had a boy in a shirt and a boxed cap. Come over. The boy's skin is very white, and his eyebrows are still handsome. He is called a Buddha, a very excited guy, and a member of the fellowship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lowered his head and stood behind Du Lin’s right side, “President?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Du Linyang raised his chin. "Take a few people stare at him and see where he went. If he goes to find someone named Morris, you will come back. If he goes directly outside the city, he will catch him. Get up, then send it to Morris, tell Morris that he has money on him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of doing this is to prevent Huon from getting the money after running He can imagine that when Morris found out that his two thousand and two hundred pieces had disappeared, he would definitely count this account on Doolin under anger and despair. Although there were neat procedures to prove that he had spent money to buy the ranch from Huon’s hand, Morris would not mind trying to make up for his loss in order to collect the money and recover the loss. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling is not afraid of getting into trouble, but that doesn't mean he is willing to take the initiative to get into trouble, so he still stares at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a whistle from the door of the Buddha. Immediately, four or five teenagers who were about the same age and who were dressed almost came. From time to time, passers-by casts their disgusted eyes on them. If they were not in their pockets, they would occasionally poke their heads and let everyone close their mouths. I am afraid someone has to reprimand them. These young people are excited about their faces, as if they are doing great business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They followed him behind Huon and followed him, watching him go to Seventh Avenue and went to the transferred deli. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dudu, is our mission just staring at him?" asked a small partner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo is still a relatively famous teenager in the fellowship of the Association. He once sat in prison, and was held in a juvenile prison for one year. The reason is injury. crime. He used a pair of scissors to smash a drunkard who tried to invade his sister for thirty. He almost killed the drunkard alive. If it is not for the cause of the incident, Mr. Shanghai Dale sent a lawyer to help the Buddha. I am afraid that he will not come out in a year. He may not be able to come out in the eleven years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drunk was rescued at the time, but died of organ failure a few days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all Buddhas are very prestigious among these little friends, everyone is looking forward to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded at this moment," the president told me to let me stare at him. If he came to see Morris, we would go back if he went straight out of town. Grab him back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking that Huon had already walked out of the deli, it took less than five minutes before and after, which is afraid of Some are fast. Dufu immediately stood up straight and pointed his head to the little friends around him: "Not quite right, you stare at him, I will go and see Morris is not there.", the friends don't know what to do. Can prove that Morris is not there, but they have an inexplicable trust in the Buddha, immediately patted the chest to pack the ticket, must be fixed on Hu En. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the arrangement, I saw that Dufo went a few steps along the sidewalk, opened the mailbox at the door of a family on the side of the road, and then took out an envelope and took it in the hand. Going to the deli and ran over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I went to the delicatessen, Dudu looked at the layout of the room. There was a door behind the counter that sold bacon and ham. There was only this door in the whole room. He lowered some caps and walked toward it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, someone stopped him, "Kid, don't mess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo Raised the envelope in his hand. "Someone asked me to come here to send a letter to a gentleman named Morris."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Block his deli staff just To reach out and grab, all Buddhas hide behind him and escape his hand. "That can't be done, let me send the letter to the gentleman, must be handed to Mr. Morris's hand, and will give me very money. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all Buddhas only say the first half of the sentence, then the clerk will say that I will hand it over. But when he said that there was still a lot of money, the clerk took back his hand and let the road open. "Take the left door and turn to the last room. Don't steal things, don't run around!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha has a smile, and he goes to the inside with a nod. "I am not a thief!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the door, he looked around. The right side was a cold storage. On the left was a corridor about ten meters long. There was a door on each side of the corridor. There was also a door at the end of the corridor. He ran to the innermost part of the left side, knocked on the innermost door, and heard a "coming in" inside. He opened the door and first found a head, the room was small, there was a big table, and there was a set of worn sofas and a coffee table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of change and coins on the coffee table, and the guys who are not good at first sight are counting money. Sitting behind the big table was a guy in a white suit and pink shirt with a powdery face and two feet on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at the Buddha and raised his eyebrows. "What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp All the Buddha raised his hand and shook his envelope. "Someone asked me to send a letter to a gentleman named Morris. Is Mr. Morris there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The guy with the oily face took back his feet and looked at the Buddha with some doubts, indicating his identity. "I am Morris, who sent you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
