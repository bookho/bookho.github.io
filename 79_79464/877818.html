			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky in the morning is a bit bleak, and the dark clouds that have not been seen for many days seem to be running around today, and the damp air has made many people feel depressed. There is still no movement in the city that should have been noisy, but more and more pedestrians on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of businessmen are gathered in Doolin’s office. They are worried and a little anxious. No one here would like to strike. This means that the construction will be Delays, expenses will become bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more people gathering on the street, but there are absolutely no more Bucho’s imaginations. Some people will follow the advice of the workers' union. They are used to listening to the advice and requirements of the workers' union. Some people who should appear do not appear. Not everyone will be at the mercy of the workers' union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Simon, he should have appeared on the street with his own person, and then held up the placard made by the workers’ union overnight, holding a sign and shouting a unified The slogan walks on the street. But just last night, he suddenly changed his mind, he decided to strike, but did not participate in the parade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are not as many people as you think!" Bujuo was a little unhappy. He didn't know how many people came, but certainly not imagined. So many, at least not crowded the streets, there are many places in the distant streets. He did not know who he said, perhaps to himself. He doesn't like these disobedient workers. These people don't even understand that he is doing this not for himself, but for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no worker union, the capitalists will do their utmost to exploit their labor, give them a modest salary, crush their sweat and then put them Kick out. Has this happened less? If there is no help from the workers' union, what do the injured and disabled workers get a lot of compensation from the capitalists? If there are no workers, what is the guarantee of their welfare? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stupid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the definition that Bucho gave to these people. He sorted out his mood and then looked at more than 30 contractors and gently moved. The head, the parade began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strike seems to be always inseparable from the parade. As long as there is a strike, there must be a parade. The foreman took the workers with all kinds of signs and walked down the street. They shouted the deafening slogans, one by one as if they were the family of the injured worker or the apostle of justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, there are reporters over there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin standing on the fourth floor of the City Hall Pointing to some reporters on the street holding a camera and constantly lighting the spotlight, there is no nervous expression on his face. It seems that his calm appearance has affected these investors in the room and made them feel a little relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mayor Doolin, how are you going to deal with this massive strike march?" The speaker is called Lyon, who invested in the city of Otis The shopping mall, covering an area of ​​more than 4,000 square meters, has a total of ten floors. Once completed, it can be regarded as one of the three largest shopping malls in Otis, with a total investment of more than 15 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a worried look on his face. The delay in the construction period means that he needs to pay more for the unemployed workers. The workers’ union is not The first time they deal, they are also deeply impressed by their hegemony. They all went on strike, but they still counted their salary according to ten hours of work a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin showed a relaxed smile. "Don't worry, Mr. Lyon, I promise that no more than three days, workers will work on the site of all of you. They are harder and harder, and there are not too many unreasonable demands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words let the investors in the house think of something, Lyon can’t wait Asked: "Do you mean that you have gathered a group of workers from other places?", he shook his head in sorrow. "It’s useless. No matter where the workers come from, most of them will join. In the workers' union, in the end we still have to face the unreasonable demands of the workers' union." He hesitated a moment and said hesitantly: "In fact, we might as well give money to the injured worker, and things will calm down." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wrong!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s powerful words shook everyone in the room Mind, "When the child needs a toy, you reject him. He will cry or roll on the ground. If you compromise this time, he will realize that it is useful. When his future demands are not met, he will use this method frequently to force him. You compromise. You either choose to meet his requirements or choose another method."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In my case, I will choose to slap him and let him know who is the father!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The workers I transferred have absolute The right to control, do not need to worry about them falling to the workers' union, I can assure you each of them here. I can make a promise, if they are in place after the deadline is more than one week later, I will compensate you for the loss. Similarly, if you complete ahead of time, are you willing to pay more commissions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some investors looked down for a moment and felt that they had reached this with Du Lin. There will be no loss in the agreement, and the potential benefits of completing the construction period will be greater. The investors who dare to invest here have the least investment projects of two million. While they have great courage, they also have an outstanding business vision. At the same time, they can understand that when they finish early, they will become the choice of people one day earlier, and they will cultivate the inertia consumer group one step earlier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such an atmosphere, under Du Lin’s explanation, everyone suddenly became more relaxed and reached an agreement with Du Lin. Three days before the completion of the construction period, there are 100,000 extra bonuses. There are 30,000 extra bonuses in the early week. If they can be more than fifteen days earlier, they are willing to pay 100,000 yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to thank all of you for the generosity of the upcoming workers, let us continue to pay attention to the parade below!", Du Lin's words put everyone's attention Pull back to the parade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucho has been watching the flashing figures behind the windows of the City Hall. He looked at the watch and the strike started for twenty minutes, but now There is no liaison or negotiator to contact him, expressing the willingness of the City Hall and the capitalists to compromise. He knew that these people were strong, or they were discussing countermeasures. He smiled confidently and watched the parade from the door of the city hall to the city center. He also followed the team and moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will always give in! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bujo’s invited reporters were shooting the parade, and even Du Lin saw that people with heavy video equipment were filming, that was his people. The people of the Empire Star Media Company will not only report in the newspapers, but also present them to all the people in the mainstream middle and high-class class, telling everyone what this is a “strike parade”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the team began to enter the center of the city, Du Lin regained his gaze, he let Dove send some wine and paradise, followed by a relaxed salon. Doolin wants to discuss with them the future and development of the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Savi in ​​the parade wore old clothes, holding a sign and shouting slogans, but he looked at the surrounding streets from time to time, just when he saw a local-run jewelry store, suddenly from the crowd. Rushed out. While shouting and hitting the capitalist, he picked up the wooden stick that didn't know where to get it and broke the window of the jewelry store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken glass lies quietly on the ground, and the jewels behind the original glass are exposed to the free air. Savi grabbed the jewels in one hand and shouted at the shopkeeper who was stunned by the sudden change in the store. "Call these businessmen, ugly capitalists!"<br /><br />&nbsp; There was a brief riot in the parade, and some young people watched Savi’s squandering a lot of valuable jewels into their pockets. Some of the uneasy workers also strode out. The formation of the team quickly puts the jewelry into his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more young people seem to have been infected and started attacking the roadside shops, robbing the goods inside, and even beating the shopkeepers who guard their private finances. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The riots alarmed the team, and some even shouted slogans like "Law not blame," and then rushed to shops that were not yet beaten. Finally, the team was completely chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savi’s pocket-filled jewellery crowded out the crowd, and he pulled out a burning bottle from the loose clothes, igniting and throwing it away. The smashing jewellery shop, the flames vacated in an instant, and the heat waves stimulated the workers who joined the snoring team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of the team is completely chaotic, and the riots spread like a horrible plague, and the parade in the city center is completely chaotic. Now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the message was fed back to Bucho, his face suddenly changed dramatically. The parade was officially allowed. The time, route, and slogan must be submitted first. And to ensure the safety of demonstrators and non-paragraphers. If such a riot occurs, then this is not a parade, it is a riot, it is a riot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately rushed toward the direction of the city center, not caring about the new twenty-eight dollars of leather shoes on his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he ran too slowly, the riots changed too fast, he spent five minutes running in twenty minutes, but what he saw It is a crowd of people who are smashing and smashing everywhere, and a large number of innocent citizens who are crying on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
