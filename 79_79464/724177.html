			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collective emotions are sometimes like a tiny lake, just press this shock, and everything will return to calm. But if you don't solve it, the waves will soon become a huge wave. After several days of demonstrations, there was no clarification from the exchange of Xiu En. The City Hall also unexpectedly remained calm. It seems that the managers of Xien and Te Nil are planning to use cold treatment to calm the incident. The treatment of cold treatment cannot be said to be wrong. It is indeed the most appropriate method when faced with many problems, but sometimes it can only play a role in fueling the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because for some groups that are angry, silence means guilty conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this can’t blame the way that Xi’an chose the wrong way to deal with it. He is not an agent of administrative origin, he has been playing since he entered the police investigation bureau. With the role of the executor, his ability to handle such things is far less than the administrative staff who sit in the office and let him once look down. For fear of the media, the angry middle class, the silent city administrators, and the meditations that don’t know how to do it, the whole city of Tener is like a huge fermenting vessel, and some subtle things are rapidly expanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should stand up and make things clear, only in this way can calm down the farce as soon as possible.", Xiuen sipped his mouth and drunk the wine, he sealed it. The private wines are all highly wine. According to the relevant regulations of the Prohibition Bureau and the second Prohibition Order, these contraband items that have been inspected will be destroyed at regular intervals. Of course, it is not a big problem if the insiders drink it before destroying it, as long as everyone does not say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elegant restaurant was separated into a private space by a curtain, and there may be some talking around, but everyone is consciously keeping A whispered conversation will not affect others, nor will it reveal the content of the conversation. The silver tableware on the table exudes dazzling luster under the light. Every dish is very beautiful. This is a very high-grade restaurant. The cost of dining is naturally expensive, and the low-level and low-level screens are naturally screened out. People. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin uses a knife and fork to break down a complete piece of lobster meat. The price of this main course needs eighty-nine yuan. The price of this meal may exceed Three hundred pieces. But it doesn't matter, not only does Dolin need not even pay a penny for this meal, and Xienen doesn't have to pay anything for it. Just need him to nod, the owner of the restaurant will smile for him. This is not because of how great the grace is, nor is he knowing the owner of the restaurant. All the reasons are in his position. The more upscale restaurants, the more demanding high-alcoholic wines are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those merchants and dignitaries who are in a huge family can't buy a bottle with a choice of money, and they also have a low-grade wine with a strange smell and a mouth-watering taste. They need a high-alcoholic wine filled with fascinating aroma like liquid gold. . This is related to the income and source of a restaurant, so it is the responsibility of each restaurant owner to be able to meet with the director who specializes in the management of contraband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School put down the glass, his eyes were a little scarlet, and his eyes were covered with bloodshot eyes. He had a bad rest in the past few days. When he was so confused that he was about to enter his sleep, the laughter of the children and the "beep" of the simulated pistols came from the ear. . At first he thought that someone was pranking and wanted to torture him in this way, but he soon discovered that it was not someone else's mischief, it was his illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found a psychiatrist and also took medicine, the effect was very poor, only drinking alcohol was helpful to him. After drinking unconscious, he can sleep until dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and shook his head. "If I said that I really didn't want to do this, do you believe it?", his red eyes stared Dooling, he wants to know Doolin’s heart. In those days, people outside said that he was inside, and people inside him were quite vocal about his behavior. The key issue is not that he shot two children. The investigators inside the investigation bureau are very clear that accidents in such circumstances are certain and reasonable. The real problem is that he did not hesitate to shoot the angry father and the sad mother. This is the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mistake is not terrible, the terrible thing is that after making a mistake, using new mistakes to cover the old mistakes, this is the most terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought for a moment and then met his gaze and nodded firmly. "I believe, because you are not such a person." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are talking very fake, but I like to listen.", Xienen breathed a sigh of relief, his hands pressed on the table and pushed his body completely against On the back of the chair, "I can't fail, at least I can't fail now. I know the city better than them, and I know more about the sins hidden under the city. I am gone, they can't beat those people, and they are likely to be Differentiated and bought, eventually RCA became a garbage dump, which I don't want to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, you may feel that I am not better than them. But you forgot a bit, as long as I am still here, their firepower will be concentrated on me, the investigation bureau will have some fighting power. I may not be a good person, but I am definitely not a bad person!", said here When she was very impressed, he shook his head and smiled. Head, "there are people to come out, they used to be, now that I." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Du Lin had no interest in the feelings of Xiu En. Xiu En may be like his evaluation of himself, not a good person, nor a bad person. But this has nothing to do with Du Lin. Du Lin wants revenge, and then takes back those things that those people took from him. Of course, when he still needs to rely on the help of Xiu, he will certainly not be disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin tore a small piece of bread and dipped in the sauce in the dish into the mouth, vaguely said: "I understand, this is the responsibility!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Responsibility!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two cups remain in the air after the collision, the curtain around The curtain was suddenly opened, and several agents wearing uniforms printed with RCA entered and stood by Xien. One of them was wearing a suit and shaved his head. He first glanced at Du Lin, confirming that the kid was not threatened or a big man, and then he opened a piece of paper in front of him. "Someone reported that you shot innocent. Residents, and for this reason fabricated evidence to frame the deceased in an attempt to hide their crimes, the director of the Kansas Dispute Investigation Bureau asked you to go to Orodo to explain the situation immediately, and if convicted, you will pay for your actions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xuen rolled his eyes and held the cup to his mouth, but the guy grabbed his glass, and the two squinted, but it seemed that Xiu En seemed to be in a weak position. That one. Xiu Yan suddenly let go, the guy holding the glass of the hand did not move, he glanced at the grace, and pressed the glass on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the director of the Bureau of Contraband Investigations, he actually took the initiative to drink private wine, you are really competent!", he rubbed his hand and rubbed it with splashed wine On the back of the hand, waved and said: "Take away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deadly and quiet restaurant became lively after the group left, many people are talking about it. Xiu En, there are many people applauding to express their approval, Du Lin shook his head, took a sip of the wine in the cup, and continued to quietly taste the lobster meat on his plate. As for the Xiunen, there is no drama in the cooperation between him and Xien, which is not very meaningful to him. He himself is hard to protect himself, how can he help Du Lin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin couldn’t help but think of the big words in the dream that he often said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rely on others, always rely on yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little storm soon passed, and as for what kind of huge waves Du Lin would pick up outside, he couldn’t manage it for a while, and what he is now guilty is that he has no money in his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the waiter stood with a smile and bowed respectfully, Du Lin suddenly felt why he didn’t take him away and left him. Pay the bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching the pocket, Du Lin can only say frankly, "I didn't bring money!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you brought it!", the waiter said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good atmosphere is quickly retreating, the waiter may not know Du Lin, does not mean that the owner of the restaurant does not know Du Lin, for people like Du Lin Most of the normal business operators still hold the attitude of being sinless as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having eaten a meal of the King’s meal was also sent out, and it’s really not a good idea to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking back at the flamboyant restaurant, Du Lin squatted with a pedestrian on the sidewalk and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Xiu En was arrested and sent back to Orodor for review. The news spread in the city of Tener, a time outside the town hall The middle class of the demonstration was as excited as winning the War of the Patriotic War. It was a difficult war and finally they won. Sometimes happiness is such a simple matter, as long as you don't know the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the departure of Xien, everything seems to have restored the calm of the past. The trucks filled with private liquors cross the streets in the bright day and fill the bars and restaurants. goods. Occasionally, one or two excited young people can be seen out of a hidden alley, holding a small glass bottle tightly in their hands. Everything is the same as before the establishment of the Contraband Investigation Bureau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But behind this peaceful, there is a little bit of peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shen is unable to rely on it, we can only rely on ourselves.", Du Lin smouldering in his mouth, stepping on the chair, checking the pistol in his hand Whether the function is intact, "I never thought that one day, I will do such a technical job."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
