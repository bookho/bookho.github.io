			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes you know that what you are doing is wrong, it shouldn't be, but you must have a reason to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took out a roll of paper money from his pocket. In fact, he didn't like it, and rolled a dollar into a cylinder. But people here love to do this. It seems that they can give them more enjoyment and more satisfaction when they hold a roll of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knocking on the street immediately followed, like a majestic movement, more and more children coming out of the house, and some five or six The oldest children didn't even have clothes and shoes, just ran out as they came to the world, around the car, and the two young "big men." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bit of a hassle to send out a piece of paper money, because you need to care about everyone’s feelings and need to be distributed by one person. Although these children are poor, although some say that they are not difficult to export, they are also very polite, and this is not a conflict. When Du Lin handed a piece of money to a little girl who looked like she was only five or six years old and was wearing only a patched trousers, the little girl said a sweet thank you and then quit the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more children are coming together, and many of them know Buddha, and can’t help but call out his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo has a certain reputation among the young Guarte and children in the city of Tener, and his peers regard him as an idol and a goal, because either Formerly and now, he has changed the status quo of the family through his own efforts, making himself look very good. The younger child will be afraid of him. All of them are not completely positive in the adult's mouth. They will use the reputation of the Buddha to intimidate these children. For example, "If you don't go to sleep, I will let them all Buddha comes to you, or "put down the bread in your hand, otherwise I will send you to the Buddha." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children around have some hesitation, but under the temptation of Du Lin’s banknotes, they are constantly pushing forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more children let Du Lin feel that this is definitely endless, he took out a roll of paper money and unfolded them together. , throwing it away in the crowd. In a flash, more than one hundred banknotes were thrown into the air, and when they fell, they spread like snowflakes. The entire crowd had a "money rain". The attraction of the children suddenly shifted from the body of Doolin and the Buddha to the banknotes that were about to land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a large handwriting also allowed some adults to walk out of the house. They did not act. They just stood on the street and looked at a stranger. A familiar young man walked toward them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, all Buddha, what are you doing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone asked, both The Buddha smiled and shook his head and did not speak. He pointed to Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin set foot on the sidewalk, the children are still rushing to grab the banknotes falling in the sky, and he is empty. He sorted out his dress and squinted, making himself look serious and serious. His gaze gradually turned on the adults on the side of the road, and most of the adults who looked directly at him looked at his own eyes. It wasn't how ferocious Du Lin's eyes were, but his previous move to make these adults understand that this is a young man they can't afford. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he has money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this cruel and full of fantasy society, money is the standard for measuring everything. If you have money, you can be strong, you can be justified, you can make trouble without it. If you don’t have money, it’s better to be a poor person who is not in the world, at least not to trouble yourself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "My name is Doolin!", Du Lin faced these adults and introduced himself in a deep voice. "You may know some people, but I have never seen me. Today I came here and brought The sad news, and my confession."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never thought that I was a great big man, I was just a damn society The poor worm that struggles, maybe one day I will have countless banknotes, lying in the mansion and fooling around with dozens of women.", there was some laughter around, but Du Lin did not laugh because the second half of the sentence Not worth laughing. "But there is another possibility. I will die under a bullet flying from the corner of the street when one day is not how great."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, I am one of you. I lost my child and lost my loved ones. I am deeply sorry for this. I apologize to you for making my mistakes make you lose your family. Now, I am coming, accepting the punishment I should be subjected to, accepting the fate, and I have the slightest apology for my offer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd slowly spread, and the two women with sad colors walked up to the front of Doolin. It is the family of two teenagers who died in battle. The grief on their faces is like the carvings of the artists. They are deeply engraved into their skin, and they are carved into the depths of the soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
