			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you find a fool who often runs a dog, it means he is not a fool, stupid is you and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin fell behind the people, Luke immediately realized that Du Lin might have something to say to him, so he also slowed down, two cores The characters walked side by side at the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you should rest assured!", Du Lin took a picture of the hard cover of the hand, with each other's signature. If you have any problems after this book, you can find help through legal channels. Many times, the more wealthy people like to go to court, the more they want to flaunt their own fairness, but also because the entire judicial system can always open up to the rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin once saw a news in a dream that I don’t know where it came from. It is said that a woman sued a rich man and raped himself, the rich The attorney told everyone that it was not rape, it was just an accident. In the process he described, the woman drank too much, the rich also drank too much, and then the rich legs fell softly, just one shot into the hole. As for why women don't wear clothes and men don't wear clothes, it may be because their place is too hot. Some people asked why some DNA traces were left, so the doctor took out the certificate of the rich and premature ejaculation, and proved that he only needs to complete a reciprocating motion...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last rich Victory, the girl was arrested for extortion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;瞧, this is the victory of the judiciary, the victory of freedom, once again proves that only you can't do it, no one I can't think of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formal instrument has a strong legal effect, Luke nodded with a smile, the six million flowers are worth it, tomorrow morning in many places on the Morning Post His avatar may appear. And this time he appeared in the news definitely not because he stayed at the hotel with a female star, or spent some money in a certain place. Parallel with him will be the prominent name of the George family, and this means that he has the right to have an equal dialogue with the George family. This is an improvement in status and an increase in prestige. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke was not as arrogant and unreasonable as he was in the West when he was in a good mood, the paper in his hand had been packed into a pure steel suitcase, and Arranging people to return to the west. He only felt comfortable when he put it in his small kingdom. He didn't have any anger at Du Lin's teasing. He laughed and said: "I heard people say that communication is an important part of social interaction. I feel so, because we were able to sit down and talk, so it contributed to today's cooperation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do next, I listen to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin gave a cigarette to Luke, and they smoked while walking. "We The time is not a lot. Once the George family's negotiating team comes to Irian, it means we need to take out the things in our pockets. Before they arrive, we must expand the resources in our hands as soon as possible. You need to figure out The more things we hold in our hands, the louder the voice when negotiating with the George family. You are yours, I am my, but I will follow the standards I gave you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luke has been nodding and not talking. He knows that all of what Du Lin said is correct, and he understands this truth. It’s like he is in a gamble that can only use cash. Once everyone sat down and started to deal, you said that there are millions of tens of millions in your mine, because everyone else needs only your hands. Cash in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Du Lin deliberately clicked on another character, Juan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This signing ceremony was not attended by Juan, and Du Lin invited him. He didn't come to Du Lin. He was also very clear about what it was. It was nothing more than that Juan felt that he had found a foreign aid and pressed him. How could he not appear in front of Du Lin? Although he did not come, it is still necessary to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are partners now, which means we have a common enemy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luke immediately picked up the words of Doolin, "Juan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pointed to him, "You said it is good, it is Juan." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, there was no such thing as Juan in the plan of working with the George family. I just talked about this when I chatted with him. What people can't believe is that he actually crossed his hand and stuffed himself into my plan, so I had to take him with him. This is not my intention Luke, he is different from you, you just want I want to work with me, but Juan intervenes in my plan to kick me out of the game. He himself takes this opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a very camouflage The despicable villain, everyone was cheated by him, including me!", Du Lin's tone was a bit angry, and there was a hint of helplessness, "He knows that we have If you work together, you will definitely find ways to destroy our cooperation, or even find someone else to finance, and overwhelm us in quantity. You must be mentally prepared. If you think that I am not the best partner, feel free to join me. I will not refuse the request for bulk goods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke’s expression was also serious. He waved his hand and sneered. “I can’t do such a shameless thing, Du Lin, please be sure, I’m always on your side anyway! "What he said is awkward, but what is the real thought inside him, only he knows." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to be prepared, Juan may be able to make a move at any time!", Du Lin’s last words sighed, Luke nodded and responded, Du Lin shot I took Luke’s arm, "I am going to entertain the guests!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Du Lin’s departure, Luke lost half of the cigarette in his hand and took one There is a small iron bucket with a thick thumb, and the lid is unscrewed and the majority of the land is poured out. He took a breath, the sweet taste of the hyphae made him a little intoxicated, his brain was very clear, he knew that what Du Lin had said to him was true, but Du Lin also exposed his own weakness. That is, he does not have the "firm" that people imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people think that Doolin can be positive with Juan - although they don't admit it, but everyone can see that the relatively strong gunpowder tastes just two people just The fact that he passed the "honeymoon period" and parted ways. They have always believed that the relatively mysterious Du Lin's hands will not be less than the wealth of Juan. In this competition, Juan will be defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by Du Lin’s embarrassment, Luke realized that he was so smooth with Du Lin and doing it, Du Lin even wanted to give up the “founder "This very important position and honor, all of them explain their importance to him, or the importance of the six million in their hands to Doolin!" To put it simply, Du Lin has no money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke applauded for his own judgment, and he also believed in his own judgment. He thought that looking at Du Lin’s “darkness” Luke was like a rumor that he solved it. He offered a helping companion and started thinking about another question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan can take Du Lin out and threaten Du Lin’s plan, then do you have such a qualification? He didn't dare to think this way because he hadn't got the "admission ticket" for this game. Just after they signed the agreement, the "admission ticket" of the game has been firmly grasped by him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a guy who still has wild animals in his bones. He can call this wildness greedy or desire. He doesn’t want to be alone. The benefits are shared with others. Looking at Du Lin, who has a smile in the crowd, Luke thinks he might actually try it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is done, you can't blame him for this. If you blame it, you will blame Du Lin himself. He exposes too many things that should not be exposed. He forced himself to want to swallow all the benefits. If you can't do it, Du Lin, who is nervous now, won't take it for himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Luke is highly educated, he must be a qualified capitalist, greedy and ambitious. The most important thing is that his six parents do not recognize and pursue the interests. play hard. Not having a complete education is his biggest flaw, so he is a little bit worse, and he is a little bit worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin inadvertently turned to Luke, he raised his hand to reveal a smile, Luke also returned with a kind smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin’s meaningful smile is probably not understood by Luke. This is actually a good thing, at least he will not blame anyone in the future, no matter how he chooses, finally The people who took the first step were all of himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the news spread out, it caused a lot of people’s attention. The broken things between Doolin and Juan were enough to attract people. Now they have introduced The three parties have led to more people wanting to talk to Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the owner here, Alexander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaking hands with Alexander is a bit of a hassle because his stomach is too big, not just big and simple, but also sharp. If you want to shake hands with him or your own hands, you have to take a breath and suck your stomach in, otherwise you may encounter his big, pointed belly very rudely. When Doolin and Alexander shook hands, they didn't know how to think of a strange thing. How did Alexander progenerate his descendants with such a size? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, I always wanted to talk to you, but there was always no time.", the two walked aside, others were polite and took a proactive Distance, did not come over. Alexander and Du Lin touched the cup and took a sip of wine. "Do you think I have time to join now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is a bit confusing. When Du Lin’s heart flashed, he knew what he meant, and this is what other people think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Luke can get a ticket, why can't these local rich people get a ticket? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
