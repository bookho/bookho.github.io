			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the layers of virgin forest to the outskirts of Saint-Louis, this action has already been compromised by nearly 10%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primordial forest of the Federation has too many unimaginable dangers. This forest is located between the subtropical and tropical regions. The animals and plants in life are full of strange features. Along the way, just over two hundred people fell because of malaria, and did not include the damage caused by other poisonous insects and poisonous plants. The attitude of not paying attention to the virgin forests has finally had serious consequences. The only thing to be thankful for is that although there were non-war reductions, they finally passed through the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a roar of artillery roared, the tallest building in Sanluo suddenly exploded, and the broken stones and bricks splashed around, and people still didn’t understand it. When, the army entered the city. People began to run away and avoid the edge. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are some axioms in the world that everyone follows, such as the principle of not hurting civilians during the war, major countries have also acknowledged this. The principle, in practice, how to identify whether a person is a soldier or a civilian? In case the identification is wrong, the cost may be that several or even more armed soldiers become the bodies under the smoke. No one can bear such responsibility, so most of the time they can be driven away by civilians and cannot be driven away... ...that is the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no country will tell this rule to its own civilians, and even proactively promote war away from civilians... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the guns continued to sound, the sound of the explosion accompanied by the artillery of the army, the most prosperous Saint-Louis of the Federation fell into a sea of ​​fire. Not only the Imperial Army is attacking the various buildings in the plan, but also a group of federal locals are also fishing in the water, as the most prosperous and prosperous city in the federal economy, St. Lodu, full of money legends. There may be tens of thousands of cash in a company's vault, not to mention the many luxury stores that may not be worthwhile during the war, but the war will always pass, and these things are still Luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s even possible that they have become more collectible because of their legendary battles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unrestrained Saint-Louis is like a mistake into the small lily in the dark alley, unable to resist anyone’s invasion, while Sail has already The first time I reacted - meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it is not a dispatch of troops to annihilate this sneak attack that bypasses the front line. It is not a discussion of the empire to discuss giving up, but a meeting. For Mr. Sail, the fall of Saint-Louis is a good thing. First, solve some of the problems left by the new generation consortium, and also solve some problems of the Federal Bank. These two sides are not too worry-free things, the former need not say, the latter there is no big problem on the bright side, in fact, it also hides some small problems. This war is the resetting of the resources of the whole society, and the large and small forces have reshuffled. Naturally, the federal bank has also been included in the sequence of shuffling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the lost money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s definitely not a problem. Losing one million and printing another one million is equivalent to losing 50% of the original wealth. If you print another nine million, then the true value of the wealth looted by the imperial army is only one-tenth. In some special cases, it is not unacceptable to use some slightly radical ways to make up for the loss. As a federation with a unique financial and economic instrument, it has an unparalleled experience in this kind of thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the first thing Mr. Sail has to do is to have a meeting to discuss how to deal with this sneak attack on the army in the federal hinterland. After more than two hours of meetings, the meeting finally ended, and then some soldiers stationed in the fourth city chain began to transfer, responsible for annihilating the army that attacked Saint-Louis. Such a slow response speed of course makes some people who are deeply affected by this sneak attack dissatisfied, but in the face of Mr. Sail, who is in power at this time, these people can't do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message of "conquering" Saint-Louis quickly spread back to the empire, once again detonating the enthusiasm of people, people have taken to the streets to celebrate this, Like the empire has conquered the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, we just received the news that the Imperial Army conquered Saint-Louis, do you have any opinion on the next trend?", the host from The pilot took a hand and looked down when the camera was cut out, then asked the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat down, the sofa here is short and deep, and when you do it, it feels like sitting on the ground, always Some awkward, he said after a slight indulgence, "This is a good thing. Saint-Louis is the federal financial and economic center. If the Sanluo is conquered, it means that the financial order that the Federation has collapsed will be completely paralyzed. For all the citizens of the Federation. The mental blow is also very heavy. This represents a further decline in the federal power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
