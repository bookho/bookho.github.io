			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not necessarily something to do with the investigation...", someone couldn’t help but speak, everyone’s eyes were focused on this guy’s Body. His voice is getting weaker and weaker, and finally he simply shuts his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this step, none of the young people who are not in the society are present, and the nature of their work exposes them to more social phenomena. And some things that people don't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was a misunderstanding that someone was reported to have explosives yesterday, what happened today would mean that it was not a misunderstanding. It is true that some people are engaged in the George family. From such an arrangement, the status and power of these people will definitely not be much worse than the George family. The other party took Mr. John and Mr. Mark to give a very clear statement that they are illegal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many people’s perceptions, it seems that the idiom is only harmful to the lower and middle levels of society. In fact, this vocabulary is as lethal to the top of the social tower. And it is more terrible than the middle and lower levels. Because only the hand holds the exact evidence, ensuring that the other party can fall down and then can't climb again, dare to let the law work on these tycoons. This is not the ordinary people who have no social status and strength. These tycoons can spend a lot of money that ordinary people can't imagine to pull up a luxurious lawyer group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Kevin is a lawyer who has a grade, the hourly consultation fee is 1,500. They hire two or thirty people. These people are enough to Find loopholes in the first law and win the lawsuit as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a tycoon is burdened with a lawsuit and he is won, then this is definitely not a fun thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it’s clear that these people who plan to move the George family are definitely not simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to open the venue and meeting without the owner. In the afternoon, they got the news that Mark may have to face up to a week’s detention. The best solution the lawyer made for him. Paying a small fine and being held for a week is not a very serious punishment, but if the refusal is implemented, the court also gives an explanation, then Mark will face the trial of the highest hanging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the standard of sentencing that was originally set up to serve the nobility, but the ceiling of this penalty has not changed to date, not to whom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once it is determined that a lawsuit is to be filed, Mark will be taken prisoner until the end of the lawsuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it may not come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he accepted the lawyer’s advice, paid a fine of twenty dollars, and lived in the police station for a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. John’s situation is a bit of a hassle, because the 17 newspapers that filed proceedings against him and the George family did sell some of the shares to him at a very low price. And he does control the entire newspaper industry in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspapers that are not owned by him are hard to survive. They may not even have four editions - that is, a whole page of four pages are printed, so In this industry, if you want to have timely news, you must purchase a press release from the feature company. When purchasing a press release from the special publication, it is necessary to give up part of the shares to Mr. John. The monopoly is like this. He directly slams the "source" and everyone has to pay the "energy fee" to survive in this industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it’s the Anole fee, a word that only flows from the gang’s mouth, is imposed on Mr. John’s, and a newspaper used it in the complaint. “The hooliganism of the newspaper industry” describes Mr. John, so it is not surprising to use words like the fee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. John and Mr. Mark will face a long period of inability to get out of the way. The so-called newspaper union has nothing to set up in the short term. Doolin gets the news. I paid a little attention to it. After all, the Anti-Industry Manipulation Act has a little credit for him. This bill will become an Anti-monopoly Act after a certain achievement, through continuous addition of new content and changes to old content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capitalists are all bad? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why should Du Lin and the capitalist "dead"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the problem is very simple, that is because the capitalists are "crossing the line", and they are destined from the moment they support their political spokespersons through sponsorship and other means. They and the top of the empire's political arena have become enemies. After the minister's level, big men such as Magus are very hateful about the power of capital, because those who are corrupted by capital power are not pursuing ideals and reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of their support for political spokespersons is not because the political ideas of these politicians have impressed them, so that their hopes of crying and sorrow can bring a great politician to the empire, and their purpose is simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will send you to the position, and you will give me enough rewards and benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of return is not necessarily the money they sponsor to politicians, but it will eventually become money. After all, everyone knows that money is omnipotent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will ask for a variety of benefits, policies, and control their own political competitors by controlling their own political spokespersons. There has been a scholar who once said that finance and war are both forms of political extension, but now this form seems to have begun to be reversed or even forced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest political hall of the empire is not the downfall of merchants seeking profiteering. This is a sacred place. Anyone in this position will not be selfish in nature, and there may be no, because it will not affect the future trend and national policy of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But once the cabinet is filled with spokespersons from various consortia, the empire may be finished, not because something has caused the various states of the empire to fall apart, or to die in the war of aggression. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only by limiting the capital, let them know that some things they can’t touch, and they can’t touch, they will be honestly a businessman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good wish for now, and a group of people are constantly working in this direction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The George family is definitely not the last one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the promotion of Otis City investors and some of Doolin’s measures, some tourists have already arrived in Otis in advance, they have never seen such a modern city. There isn't even a dilapidated house in the city, and it's a brand new building from start to finish. Although there has been a period of overall opening, some small facilities have been put into operation, such as some supporting projects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When planning for the city, Du Lin considered taking a hodgepodge here and attracting features from other places, such as the West. Traditional projects such as horses and bullfights. This makes the passengers from the South and the East feel extraordinarily fresh. Nowadays, the ranch outside the city circle has gathered many people every day. Many people want to try this rough and full of male hormones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bar and some entertainment venues in the city are all open for business. With Doolin’s SAR law, even the mushroom powder is placed on the counter. Of course, buying these things must be able to prove that you have grown up and signed a letter of responsibility. This thing is a little more dangerous than cigarettes and wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lively city has revived the life of this quiet town for decades. Every time Du Lin goes to work, there will be local residents. Very respectful and greeted him. For locals and those who invest here, what Du Lin did before did not matter, what was important was the change he brought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Du Lin asked Kevin to relax in a private room on the third floor of the bar called Di Lin. During this time, Kevin has been busy dealing with the families of the two guys. He started to file a lawsuit against them from tax evasion and taxation. Not only did they make up the taxes that they had stolen these years, but they also got a lot of penalties. . Now the two dead ghost family members have moved out of Shangcheng District, they have no ability and no money to continue to maintain their decent life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not enough. The anger and resentment that Kevin faced when he died at that moment could not be exhausted so easily, and his legs were paralyzed. For a man who is "exquisite" like him, his legs are almost the same as his life, so he made a fuss, and he must let the two idiots already in heaven know what it would cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is constantly prosecuting the two families for all sorts of small things, so that they finally sell the house, and now live in the most broken and worst of Oro. Rental room. They live around a group of the most jerked people in Orodo, thieves, gangs, robbers, rapists... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only then, Kevin took a sigh of relief, then he accepted Du Lin’s invitation to see the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You made a good job here?!" When I first saw Kevin, Du Lin couldn’t say a bit. Kevin’s temperament was a bit gloomy and his eyes were not small. And it is black, he may not have time to rest well during this time, completely immersed in the plan of revenge. This is a bit of a ghost, but he did not persuade that everyone is an adult and has his own persistence and ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin lost a box of cigarettes on the coffee table. "I arranged your favorite items for you, relax and rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
