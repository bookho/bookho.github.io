			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler invited his two good friends to the idea of ​​doing this, hoping that these two people can make the same choices with themselves. The moment of this crisis left the empire, looking for a remote country place to live in peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you treat them now, the more you don’t care, the more panicky you are. It’s often said that when people are older, it’s easy to be scared of small things. In fact, this statement is essentially wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older people are more timid, because they have seen too many accidents in this life and have seen too many small things But it caused the tragedy of people to die. Young ignorance is too frivolous, always thinking that he can conquer the whole world, and there is no fear of the world. It is the heavy price that these young people are ignorant and fearless, so that older people can start to fear and understand awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, his two friends did not intend to leave the empire. The performance of all aspects of the empire is in all the best direction. The economic take-off and the situation of war make every person living in the empire have an inexplicable encouragement, as if the empire is the core of the world. Is the only civilized society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After people who are used to wearing clothes to go out, how can they run out with their ass? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of their father’s betrayal of the country was to gain glory and power. If they lost everything, why should their fathers bear the nickname of treason in exchange for this? these things? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no small towns with beautiful scenery, and they are also underdeveloped in the countryside. Moreover, they have spent a lifetime of hard work to run their own industries. How can they say that they will give up their homes? And the fear is not from themselves, it is from one other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to say two friends, Heideler can only send them away with a smile, then let the butler sell their own industry as soon as possible, and pack some of the things they need to take away. Things, leaving the empire within a week, he will not wait any longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler has had many lovers so far, but he does not have any blood descendants. He has world-famous incurable diseases and cannot have any own descendants. . Some people say that his father's retribution fell on him. Others said that he can actually give birth, but he is pretending to be himself. Only he knows that he is really infertile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he has a adopted son and his relationship with him is very good. After all, Heidler adopted such a descendant, and will not make a tragicomedy for the heirs. The relationship is very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Heidler’s adopted son called Heidler because he heard that Heidler was selling his own industry, so the forty There are some faint anger among the middle-aged people of the age, and there is still a glimpse. Why does Heidler sell his own industry at this time? Is it that he wants to transfer the property to the parents who are secretly in the rumor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of any speculation, there was an unresolved place in his heart. Heidler’s actions did not inform him, he was completely unaware of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler said on the phone that it was not very detailed. In short, he told his adopted son that he would sell all the industries, part of it to the empire, and part of it to the empire. He, in the end, Heidler will leave the empire with a small part and find a place to live in seclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard Heidler made such an irrational move, and his adopted son told him on the phone that he would interview him as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just after Heidele hung up the phone and simply took a break to prepare for a break, his body immediately became stiff at the moment he entered the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please close the door, sir." There is a long, thin figure in the cloakroom without lights. He is hidden in the dark, only seeing the white trousers and black Leather shoes, the young voice is a bit familiar, he can't remember when and where he heard it, but he heard another thing, accent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s the accent of the city of Tener, it’s definitely not wrong, he lived in the city of Tener for a long time, a lot of there Everything is very familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two kinds of lingua franca in this world, one is a common language based on the old civilization, and the main use area is part of the western and southern continents. The pronunciation and grammar of this lingua franca is closer to the ancient terms, and the tone is beautiful and powerful. It is a bit like singing again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another two continents, including the new civilized lingua franca that is used by the empire, which is the language that people use today (Nanda Road Most countries do not use lingua franca, and there are more native languages). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two lingua franca are distinct because of the historical background and geographical environment. The western continent has some ancient books and ancient buildings that are relatively intact. They are all before the great destruction. Many small countries are very obsessed with the civilization before the great destruction. Before the beginning, the king chiefs on the western continent thought that they were the most orthodox successors of the old civilization, imagining conquering other forces and then unifying the world. In order to ensure that their origins can withstand the test, they use the ancient lingua franca that has been passed down for a long time. As for whether this language is really ancient, it is another problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new civilized lingua franca is the main language of the other two continents, the Northern and Eastern Continents, combining the changes of the mainstream population and history, and finally the perfect one. A general language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language can be the same, but the accent is absolutely impossible to unify, probably because of the historical relationship, it may be because different races are different in organ development, in short, each The accent of the place is not the same. The city of Tener is a small country and a federation. It belongs to a place where the accent is mixed. Under the integration of many accents, there is a special vocabulary accent of the city of Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some syllables, there will be some dragging and adding sounds. For example, the word "good morning" in Tener City will say something like "early" The feeling of "scattering". It was originally a relatively mixed, relatively backward place, cultural exchanges were relatively closed, and a combination of various factors formed this accent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy hidden in the cloakroom, although the accent is not heavy, but Heidele still can hear the faint Turner accent, while there are some guar The habit of human pronunciation, what he has realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed the door of the bedroom and locked it, then went to the edge of the bed and put on his pajamas. The sagging skin is like a resin bloated on his body. The brown age spots are piece by piece. He has been in trouble for a few years. The mental and physical fatigue makes him faster than the same age. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed the silk pajamas, he turned and looked at the shadow in the cloakroom, thinking for a moment, then asked, "It’s Dulin’s coming. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person pressed the button on the wall, the soft white light lit up, revealing the handsome face of Buddha, he smiled like no heart The boy who had no lungs nodded and acknowledged Heidler’s speculation. “Mr. Doolin originally wanted to come over in person for the first time, but he has some things to deal with temporarily, so let me visit you first.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler looked at the surrounding environment and said with a smile that I almost trusted. "This is not the way to see me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Buddha slowly walked out of the cloakroom, he shrugged and pulled a bottle of wine and two cups from the wine cabinet on one side, placed it on the cupboard, and poured some wine. A cup was given to Heidler, and a cup was in his own hands. "Do you manage it? In short, I just have to do it according to the boss. The form and process are not important." He raised the wine glass, took a sip and sat. On the couch, "You can rest or do whatever you want, about two o'clock, the boss will come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler mouth A corner, a little smile, "Do you want to leave here?", not waiting for the Buddha to answer, Heidele also sat down, "How does Du Lin plan to deal with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should have thought of..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hedler squatted on the bed after a chat for a while. Sleeping in the past, it is a life instinct to go to bed early in the morning, even if he has to face terrible things, he will not disturb his sleep, it can be said that this is his strength, of course, it is possible It is he who wants to die in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the result is destined not to proceed as he imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three cars entered the manor at three o'clock in the evening, and all the people had been subdued when Doolin walked in through the building's gate. As he walked towards the Heidler bedroom through the central walkway, he paused and stood still. He turned to look at a guy standing against the wall, wearing glasses in his forties, and he looked very educated. When Doolin looked at him, he lowered his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect us to meet again!", Du Lin laughed like a Buddha, like a naive child, with a pure smile, but his words, but Let the man's body tremble slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the men around him and looked at the man again. "I am very sorry, I dirty your car the last time you used the car you used." I am deeply sorry about this..." This guy was the driver who picked him up in Grael and Graf to see Heidler. Du Lin would never forget the treatment he received that day, the kind of contempt The eyes and the action of wiping the cushion ignited his murder. This killing is hidden until now, and finally broke out when it reunited today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
