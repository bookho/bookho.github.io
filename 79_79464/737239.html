			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no trace of living creatures in the quiet bank hall. Prando is carrying a heavy helmet and holding a shield with a viewing port. Out of the head. There was no bullet to greet the shield in his hand, and there was nothing to blame and curse, only a few bodies lying on the ground. He breathed a sigh of relief, his guess was not wrong, the robbers should leave, which made him relieved. Of course, he did not blindly remove the helmet and throw off the shield to take off the bulletproof vest. Instead, he moved it step by step. The lack of crossfire made the young police officers behind him somewhat embarrassed, unable to speed up and defended Prando in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they are doing beautifully now, they can’t save their position in Prando’s mind. A group of policemen who have no courage and dare to openly violate their own orders, there is no need to continue to struggle in this industry, and sending them out early is the most correct choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one came to block them after about ten meters. Prando immediately dropped the shield and pushed the young police officer in front of him. He went to the nearest one. The guard's body smashed down. The unlucky guy has a small hole in his head and a few petals in the back of his head. Prando frowned and turned his body over, and then went to the other three bodies with a serious look. He took a sip of cold air, and the difficulty and danger of chasing the robbers might have increased several steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rifles of these guards are gone, which means that the robbers have been upgraded on weapons, with more powerful rifles, once the crossfire police The equipment here will be worse than the robbers, which makes Prando a headache. The revolutionary army and some civilian extremist forces have made the empire's control over firearms very strict... well, this is a shit. It is useless to ban guns in the empire's developed areas, but it is still very effective in small places like Turner. The rifle's rate of fire, the capacity of the bomber, and the range and penetration are much higher than the pistol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even wearing a body armor may not be able to withstand a rifle shot within a certain range, not to mention that the continuous rate of fire requires only one or two rifles. Can form a fire suppression. He stood up in a heavy heart and told him, "Let the idiots outside get me in, and the bank manager who is at home, we are going to the underground vault." He hesitated and continued: "Notify the reporter to come over, we have to issue a wanted order, and let my secretary go to the mayor and the parliament to come over..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a series of orders were issued, the police who were outside the bank flooded into the bank. They searched the entire bank and found no suspicious people or suspicious things. The robbers disappeared in a flash. same. Prando and the police veteran in the police station are still thinking about the specific circumstances of the case, and heard a few loud footsteps. He immediately straightened up and greeted him, and looked slightly serious and bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor’s adult and the parliamentarians came together, and the faces of the two did not see much change in peace, but they were vaguely through their eyes. It can be found that they are hiding the violent emotions under calm at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way not to be violent, this is the Imperial Central Bank, the largest economy of the empire, known as the terrorist economy of the Yaoxing Empire's money bag! It is no exaggeration to say that the Imperial Central Bank has already affected all aspects of the country in silence. They only need one sentence to promote the passage of a bill. Similarly, if they are not happy, a region’s economy will emerge. A clear recession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Imperial Bank branch in the city of Tener has a problem with the urine of the big people in the head office, in addition to the internal adjustment and inspection, the stick It will also fall on the city manager of the Tener. Peter also intends to fight for the possibility of attacking the governor during the change. If it is not able to solve this problem perfectly, the success rate will not be much higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at Prando and suddenly frowned. "Since the robbers have left, why not chase them? Or do you think you are robbery?" If the case is not directly related to you, you can sit back and watch the robbers fleeing to see other people's jokes?" The members standing on the side of the mayor did not speak, but the turbid eyes looked at Prando's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly bowed his head and explained, "The robbers have left when we arrived, how many things they took, how they left, how many people We don’t know anything about the firepower, etc. I have already asked the bank manager to take a break, and after we open the underground vault, we can get a little more clues before we can pursue the robbers more reasonably." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor of the city snorted and whispered in a corner with the parliamentarians. Prando recruited his secretary, who sometimes had other uses, and asked: "How did they come together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary pushed her eyes and did not understand it very clearly. The first place she went to was the City Hall. I did not expect the mayor to be with the MPs at the time. Prando frowned and flung the secretary, and his mind was in chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know, just yesterday morning, there was a leak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of Xiuen, who was personally taken away by the governor to conduct the trial, was almost convicted, and the appearance of one person directly overturned all evidence and testimony. Let Xiun be acquitted. This person is not someone else, it is Ernst who was expelled by the mayor through less wise means. He thought that Ernst left Turner and even left Cannes. After all, Karur would never let go of this man who had hatred with him to continue to live around the area where he lives, but the mayor did not think of the card. Ruhr actually stopped at the end, gave up and continued to pursue Ernst, and began to enjoy the fruits of his victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernst appears to be surrendering, acknowledging the fact that he smuggled private smuggling and smuggling of narcotic drugs during the city of Tener, and in his There is also a very important message in the statement. He said that he has a downline to help him smuggle and carry so that he sells anesthetic drugs, and that downline is just the family that was killed by Xiuen. Is this a coincidence? This is certainly not a coincidence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernst was forced by the mayor and Karel to push for nowhere, and he was desperate to start thinking about ending his life. But when he heard that Xiu Yan was arrested for his misconduct and the shooting of innocent citizens, he immediately realized that he was actually useful. He may not have the means to avenge himself, to do something for the mayor and Karur, but Xiun can. He is also very clear that the experience of Xiu En is definitely designed to frame, then he believes that Xiu En certainly hates the mayor and Karur like him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at this time he frees Xiun from the jail, will he revenge with the current power and ability of Xiuen? This is a matter of course, Xiu En will be like a bad dog biting the mayor and Karur not to let go, even if Ernst needs to pay for the jail, Ernst feels very cost-effective . This is tantamount to indirect revenge for himself, so he rushed to the State Prohibited Goods Investigation Bureau a few days ago and gave a long confession to help Xiuen get rid of the crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He actually wants to drag the mayor and other high-level leaders together in his mouth and testimony, but he knows that he has no direct evidence to show that there is no direct evidence. The managers are all caught in his case. His sister is just the mistress of the mayor. In this world where morality cannot be determined by an official, this is just a lace news. He does not have evidence of direct dealings with the mayor, nor does he have any evidence of substance that can be charged, so he can only do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
