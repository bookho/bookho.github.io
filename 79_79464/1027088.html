			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos adjusted his sitting position, and Du Lin’s answer made him feel a little tricky. “This is a cost that can be too heavy for the metallurgical industry and for us to solve some of the costs. The formula may not be eye-catching in a certain job, but I believe that in the long-term use, the cost savings are also a big number, saving at least hundreds of thousands to hundreds of steel mills per year. You know, we also have our own metal processing companies, reducing costs is what most businessmen want to do, and please believe in my sincerity and urgent desire."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since Mr. Carlos, you are interested in this formula, if I refuse you because of my ignorance, it seems that I am very rude, so you just said that I open a price, then you accept, yes "Duo Lin is not sure what kind of person Carlos is, but he knows that this person will become a person who doesn't like himself later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos’s eyelids jumped twice because of Doolin’s words. He nodded and tried to make himself look relaxed and casual. “ Yes, I have always been very generous to my friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"10 billion, Empire Star."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The air solidified in a moment, the two looked at each other, no one avoided the other's eyes, and the smile on Carlos's face gradually converges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About twenty-seven eighty and thirty seconds, Carlos suddenly laughed, his voice and movements gave the atmosphere that had already solidified. The big easing, he laughed and leaned forward, and the tears of laughter came out. "Mr. Du Lin... Haha, you are a very humorous person, your jokes are very funny, and my stomach is a little twitching."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is laughing too, he is not so exaggerated, but definitely not the kind of joke, "Is it? I also think this joke is very interesting. So. Mr. Carlos, I don't know about this patent. I need to consult relevant professionals before I can give you an accurate answer. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This is very reasonable!" Carlos put away his exaggerated laughter and nodded with Du Lin’s statement. "This is also a very responsible approach. I don't want to say that one day I don't want to be decent." I took an expensive patent from your low price, the most After you learn the real value of this patent, we'll conduct a formal business negotiations. ", He said he first stood up and held out his hand to shake hands waiting and Turin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin then stood up. He sorted out his clothes and reached out and held it with Carlos. "You are a very talkative person. I enjoy the time I talked with you. I found out from you." There are a lot of things that I lack, and we have a chance to sit down and have a chat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos smiled and said, "This is also It’s exactly what I want to say!”, he let go of his hand and glanced at the watch on his wrist. The watch was very beautiful. Even if Doolin didn’t understand the watch, he could feel that the watch had at least 10,000 or more. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos regaining his gaze from his wrist and tied the two buttons at the bottom of the dress and walked toward the outside. "It’s almost time, I think it’s time to come. The people are coming, I don't want to be a non-punctual person." After he finished laughing, he pushed the door of the banquet hall and let Du Lin first catch up with Du Lin's pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the things that two people seem to say are very simple. In fact, there are still some confrontations between the lines, especially in the last sentence of Carlos. The person at the time, in fact, is telling Lin, he is better to go back and check the patent and give himself an accurate time. Don’t pretend to forget about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the identity and status of both parties are different from those of ordinary people, some words cannot be said so clearly. In addition to creating enemies for themselves, There is no meaning at all. Instead, this kind of relatively implicit way to remind each other in good faith, not only maintains the relationship between each other, but also allows each other not to lose the decent civilized person, but also to make it clear and more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper class is very particular about the use of words, which is precisely the reason why the low-level conspiracy theories in the society are particularly keen, because they can always Excessively find some content that is considered to involve metaphors from some conversations that may not have any special meaning, and think that the big men are all conspirators. This idea is stupid, but it is popular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the main hall, Henry immediately greeted him. The people at the cold meal meeting were all there, including the two mines brought by Doolin but not counting the number of people. the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mine owner and Federer, who haven’t even had a name so far, are standing in a corner of the main hall, where they don’t have their location, even a slightly more conspicuous place. They are not allowed to appear, they can only stand in the corner as the background wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the two are whispering, what do so many western big people appear here? It shows that the West Mine will have a horrible opponent at the time of this burnout. Once these competitors who are not friendly with each other on weekdays unite, it is absolutely fatal attack for the West Mine. What excites the two mine owners is that they may also become an inconspicuous pebbles here, but this is enough for them to find out the great changes in the situation in the west and to fight for more benefits in this change. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two have been bowing their heads, and Federer suddenly noticed that the unnamed guy wrapped his bandage in his left hand and that his little finger seemed to be broken, or Lost. He whispered in a low voice and asked, "What happened to your hand? I remember it the day before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy without the name looks awkward, "Cut the vegetables When I was distracted, I accidentally cut the little finger off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My God, are you so careless? Why not pick it up?", Medical Group Fees are always prohibitive, but the services they provide are very good, how much money to pay, how many things to do, never to collect money and do nothing. And the broken finger joint surgery is not a complicated operation, Federer is very curious about why the guy around him is allowed to cut off his little finger and not reconnect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy with no name laughed twice, "falling into the meat grinder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as they exchanged the little finger of the meat grinder and couldn't, and extended the topic of the next door, Henry stood up and walked to the middle of the main hall. He had a goblet in his hand and a silver fork in the other, and the two made a crisp crash when they collided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people in the hall, where three people who are communicating privately have looked at him. He smiles and puts the fork on the table behind him. "This time I invite everyone to come to this cold meal because the situation in the west has changed more and more than most people imagined in recent times. It is said that last night, the Imperial Army has surrounded the Freedom Front in a canyon. "Wait for some people to talk a little for a while, Henry continued, "The problems of the Western Mining Association, the problems of the Kadima Party, the problems of the Western State Government, and the problems of these illegal armed organizations have always plagued the entire West." People, these things affect the order of our normal life and work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After I communicated with Mr. Doolin, Mr. Clarence and Ms. Sandra..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry hasn't finished, Sandra suddenly smiles Asked: "Why should I put my name at the end, because I am a woman??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male friends present couldn’t help but send a goodwill Smile, Sandra is also an active feminist, but the environment on the west side is not as open and open as other places. She has initiated several feminist movements, but except for the women she brought with her. There are no other women in the entire western region responding to their call. The reason is actually very simple, because here is a world dominated by men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women’s rights can be, but they will never become trends. Gradually, Sandra also gave up the feminist movement here. At this time, the purpose of her sudden statement was not to question Henry as she said, purely to adjust the atmosphere. Henry's opening remarks pulled the words a lot, making the atmosphere a bit too serious, and he was too prominent to launch the four people at the party. This is actually an incorrect statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will let others have a feeling that there is a smaller circle of only four people among the eleven people, that circle is the core, they are not core. So Sandra's timely warfare seems to overemphasize his gender, in fact to ease a mistake Henry made in his speech. This mistake is not obvious, because Sandra believes that once it is time to distribute the benefits, they know why it is not obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, she also shows an attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, the only woman here, will definitely not be the supporting role of this small meeting, she is the protagonist... one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry raised his hands and shook his shoulders helplessly, his face was helpless, and he quickly realized that his statement was wrong, just follow Shan Della’s “barbaric” changed his own statement. “Well, okay, headed by Ms. Sandra...” He said that he paused here and looked at Sandra’s eyes. “Respected lady, me. Is that okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra took a sip with a glass of wine, "very pleasant!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
