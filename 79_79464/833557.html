			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin lowered his head slightly, closed his chin inward, and looked up at these people. His serious face made an imposing manner out of him. Like the tsunami, let the Guarts in the church ask for a slight glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some people who are not convinced on their faces, and their eyes are also being examined. Why does Du Lin feel that they are sad? Is it a sad thing to be satisfied with your life? This reason can't be said. If Doolin can't find a reason for them to be convinced, they won't be reasonable again next time, no matter what they give! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is related to the issue of dignity, more important than those foods and some small favors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When most people’s gaze began to change, Du Lin raised his head and raised his chin slightly. “I have been to many places, in the outside world, every The Guart people have their own ideals and pursuits. They may want to be respected, want more economic gains, or have a happy family and everyone is happy. Spend every day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone has an ideal, I have it, but many of you have no ideals. These are very sad things in my opinion! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dewell, are you getting married?" Diwell nodded and said, Du Lin continued: "This is good, then Two questions, do you have children?", Dewell nodded again and said that he had three children. Du Lin laughed. "You are married and have three children, but you are right for you." The life is very satisfied, I am not wrong?", Devil reaffirmed Doolin's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you want your wife to wear good-looking clothes, don't want her to wear more jewelry, don't want to give her a romantic surprise, don't want to give her A satisfactory place to live? What about your children? You hope that they will have no pursuit of life and life as you do in the future. Can you live in this city by filling your stomach? You don’t want them. Get out of here, get a better education, then find a better job outside, and finally become a middle class or even a rich man in this society?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, you don't have ideals, just because you don't have ideals, so your wife, your children will not live like this in the city like you, and then slowly decay. I am sorry about me. I said some very sharp words, but I just want to ask, when you, and more people are going to sleep every day, when they wake up, they will eat, and go day after day, year after year, In your life is going to the end Climate, you will not feel you and those of lower animals is no different "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;? & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Dooling waved at the Buddha, and then took out a small five-dollar cash from the pocket of Dufo. In this city, the denomination of five yuan is actually not too small, and even can't buy anything, because it is like a country behind, there is not much consumer goods except for necessities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of everyone, Du Lin tore the money after the roll was spread, and then waved it up, the pieces of the same kind of paper money fell like snowflakes Around him. He looked at Dewell. "The money, five hundred, may be your income for two or three years, but it was just destroyed by me, and this is because you have no ideals. Please sit down, Mr. Dewell, Maybe this is the life you are satisfied with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looks at other people, some people think thoughtfully, some people seem to be angered, Doolin shrugged his shoulders. "The first feeling after I came here is that it is dead, this is not what you should have. The Guar's unyielding is not reflected in you. In fact, before today, I have been Thinking about what to do, at least let my compatriots go better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But seeing you like this now, I feel that I don't have to go at all. Do, because you are very satisfied, changing your life will only make you lose that kind of satisfaction, so I need to apologize to everyone, this church will not open again in a short time, when one day I feel a kind of struggle called Spirit, a pursuit of ideals When the attitude, I will re-open the church, goodbye, gentlemen "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;! & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Herr Having turned left, not even a glimmer of stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must admit that this time he failed, and the failure is very thorough. The assimilation problem here is too serious, and the simple use of interests and ideals cannot be quickly pulled up. A team comes, so only one seed can be left. As for whether or not you can grow into a towering tree, you can only wait and see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the construction of the city of Otis, a lot of work needs a lot of labor to complete, and the special status of Otis is enough to attract the attention of other people, other The forces will also find that there is no unified force here, and it is still a vacuum zone. They will definitely send their own people to settle here as soon as possible. Once the people in Dulin’s hands can’t suppress these people, I’m afraid these people will pay attention to the anti-customer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not impossible, even the imperial emperor and the entire cabinet cannot guarantee that everyone on every inch of the empire has absolute Control, let alone his little mayor? Failure to do so means that he will lose his initiative and lose control of it. It will also affect his subsequent plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may even include some members of the New Party, so that Mr. Harry will covet the huge profits and influence here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally considered using local people. Once locals lived here for a long time, they also knew the residents here. Foreigners could not escape them. s eyes. Distinguishing between locals and outsiders can be very important to stabilize the order of rules here. Secondly, the families of local people are here, and they will be more assured with them. The reality can tell Du Lin that his set may not be able to pass. After some annoyed return to the town hall, Du Lin made a phone call to Carter, let him arrange some people to come and prepare for the next job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the first phase of the plan has to begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old city of Otis, Doolin has no plans to move. The problem of the arrangement of the population of 400,000 in the old city is enough for him to have a headache. It is better to establish a new city and wait for the new city. After the district is built, the people here will be moved step by step. For the first time, as the mayor of a city, looking at the macroscopic perspective and planning the development of a city is far more difficult to choose than his onlookers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every decision must be carefully thought out, not only money, time, but also its own reputation and people's trust in themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an easy job! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was a little decadent and supported a lazy waist, looking out the window, the sun was like the afterglow of the flame, sighed. He pulled the rope and it didn't take long for Natalie to appear in his office again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did I tell you yesterday, did you do it?", he refers to the establishment of the telegraph office, the cabinet originally intended to set up a brand new department To manage the telephone business, later, because someone inserted a mouth and thought that the call reporting business would be completely replaced by the telephone business, it is completely unnecessary to establish a new department, and the telegraph office can do it. When it was almost time to cancel the telegraph service, it would be fine to change the name, so all the telephone services of the entire empire were included in the telegraph office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natalie smiled a little awkwardly. After she saw Du Lin’s brow screwed up, she quickly explained: “Mr. Mayor, now we are here. Without the conditions of a telegraph office, you know that a connected telephone requires not only a switch, but also a dedicated line and a large number of staff, but nothing here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
