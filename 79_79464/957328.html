			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of private wine, Du Lin is now the first person, he did not make any compulsive moves for those private unlicensed winemakers The workshops were stopped and they were not killed by violent and cruel means. He just gave a part of the benefits to another group of strong and aggressive people. These strong people, under the urging of the interests, took the initiative to stand up for Doolin and helped him to do what he wanted to do. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in the private wine industry, there are two situations in Doolin. The first case is also the most common case, that is, it is closed. No one knows if there are people with Doolin around them, whether there are Guars who are so long that they can touch the moon, if they say something less respectful because of themselves or other stupid companions, It seems that it is not worthwhile for people from the township meeting to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So most of the time, the name Doolin is the most taboo word for these non-Duolin Group private merchants and channel traders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second case is the worship of red fruit, young people are more willing to worship their peers, and they have a feeling of admiration for Du Lin, and even think If you have the opportunity, you can become a life winner like Doolin. Some of them want to follow Doolin, but it is a pity that all the middle and lower levels of Doolin's interest groups are Guars, and only those new capitalists who join the new capital can not be identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is something worthy of attention and admiration for these people, that is, for the Guar in the Doolin interest group, no matter what his identity or class, Du Lin defines them as "family", and those big capitalists are just his partners! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So legendary physics will certainly cause some peers’ curiosity and fanatical admiration, as long as there is Doolin’s business, everyone is willing to follow his game. Rules to enforce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respect him and fear him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The looming slight change on the stage of the talk, the girls from the original tribes sweated and thanked, leaving the stage with a greasy body It makes the guests in the audience somewhat unforgettable. These girls are too pitiful. Some people take the initiative to let the waiters contact the girls instead of them. They intend to help them economically after the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programs in the bar are not always close to the people, there are some elegant things, and the way to make money in such high-end bars is not to let those skilled women and easily sweaty ladies go to the stage to tickle So naive. They are unconstrained in the style of the bar, the purpose is to make money from other aspects, such as drinks, services, cakes and even simple meals, are big earning projects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A steak with a maximum of two dollars outside, you can sell eight dollars here, you are not too expensive, this is already the cheapest meal. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about five minutes or so, a woman wearing a blue shiny dress with a royal blue dress walked onto the stage, the moment she appeared Many people cheered and the whistles came and went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked strangely at the excited agent around him and asked, "Is this woman famous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The agent stunned and explained it immediately. "She is Celine, the most popular singer of the empire. In the Imperial Art Golden Melody Awards that ended in October, she won the trophy of the best female singer of pop music... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the explanation of the agent, Du Lin gradually understood, isn't it a singer? Of course, this singer is a little different from those of the academic singers. She was born in the wild. Her family is a very "normal" farmer's family, with farms and pastures in her family. She often rode cows to sing in the pasture as a child. Later, after three years of study, and then the war broke out, she could only return home to help her parents and her brothers to do farm work. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war, about two or three years ago, several emperors bought her farm to talk about her songs when they bought large-scale business, and then She recommended it to a record company, and then debuted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ethereal voice has a power to penetrate people's souls, and soon she became popular and was called a soul singer. However, she has been rejected by the Imperial Art Golden Melody Award because she has not attended a special art school or an excellent family background. Until this year, a large number of fans marched and protested outside the office of the Imperial Art Golden Melody Awards Organizing Committee, and several old guys spoke, let her get the trophy, completely detonated the entire music scene, and even the federal side constantly The invitation was sent to the empire and invited to perform live concerts and concerts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the current market price is concerned, the price of Celine’s appearance has risen to 20,000, and only one song is sung! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin couldn't help but shook his head. This is actually a form of economic recovery. When people can fill their stomachs and don't have to worry about being frozen, they will start to think of ways to ruin their pockets. That money, to pursue spiritual enjoyment. He listened to Mason and said that the current salary of the workers of Tenell has risen from the ten to fifteen pieces almost three years ago, and has risen to a minimum of twenty-two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid economic recovery has also brought many drawbacks. The most important but the most easily overlooked is inflation. People only feel that their pockets are better than the past. With more money, and neglecting the money, it may not be as valuable as it used to be. In the past, a bar of spirits in the bar was about a price, but now there are no two or three pieces to drink. In such a high-class bar, the price of a high-alcohol wine is around four, and the price is actually very distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the quick silence of Celine’s strolling bar, the moment she opened her mouth, it seemed as if there was a special force piercing the eardrum of everyone. Direct to the depths of the soul! The ethereal and clear voice will instantly take everyone who heard her singing, take it out of this "small" bar, and take it to the endless prairie, with the infinite sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like being in the middle of the world, reaching out and embracing the whole world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin closed his eyes, and the voice continued to reverberate in the body until the song slowly ended, leaving the afterglow to make people want to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally understands that singing a song can earn 20,000. It’s not that the market is sick, but someone is worth the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly opened his eyes, the 31-year-old woman on the stage smiled slightly, but did not leave the stage immediately, people could not help I am more expecting that she can sing another song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This happens to have a group of young people from the stairs on the side of the gate to the private room on the second floor, where the private room is actually a larger deck, usually There will be thirty-five seats and four large tables, as well as four small square-shaped tables. A young man looked at Celine on the stage with a little surprise. Some face of remorse appeared on his face. "We are late, Celine has already sung!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Other young people are suddenly remorseful. They are slower. Today, the street doesn’t want to have as many cars as usual, but there are cars everywhere. On the first day of the new year, there will inevitably be many people who choose to leave the house on this special night to go around. Some shopping malls are also undergoing discounts, and they have been blocked for ten minutes. I didn’t expect the most important programs to be missed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a black-haired guy smiled and appeased everyone. "Nothing, I will discuss it with her and see if I can sing another song!", saying that he let everyone sit down and leave with the waiter. The room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father is a tobacco merchant, and tobacco business was definitely an industry that barely filled his stomach a few years ago, but with these years The economic recovery, urban construction accelerated the expansion of demand for employment, and a large number of young people from the countryside entered the city. Losing the place where they can grow their own tobacco leaves and the time of freedom, they changed from growing their own tobacco leaves to buying finished cigarettes, which drove the overall market of the tobacco industry and created a large number of tobacco companies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father of this young man named Ramazan is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net profit of this year has exceeded 7 million, which is the sum of net income in the past six years, which also gives him the confidence to say this. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is money, 20,000 songs are not expensive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramazan soon came to the backstage and explained the situation to the manager of the bar. The bar manager also agreed very much, don’t want the bar to pay for it anyway. It allowed Celine to sing a song and the promotion of the bar was excellent. He immediately introduced Celine's agent to Ramazan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic man of Celine is a woman in her forties, wearing a pair of eyes, her cheekbones are a bit high, her chin is a bit pointed, and there seems to be a kind of Not very good feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, madam...", Ramazon reached out first, and the agent glanced at it, freely reaching out and grabbing it and separating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she really dislikes such a place, it is full of chaos, full of sin, and will have a certain impact on Celine’s image. If it wasn't for the owner of the bar and an old gentleman who brought Celine, and the old gentleman mentioned this thing a little, it would not be possible for Celine to sing on such occasions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broker quickly focused on the schedule of these days, and asked casually, "What do you have?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her attitude can't be said to be good, but it can't be said bad. Ramazan frowned and said: "I hope to ask Ms. Celine to sing another song. The price is not a problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
