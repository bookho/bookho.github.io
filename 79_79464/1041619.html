			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between the empire and the federation is very wonderful. It can be said that it is not once or twice to hurt each other. There will be some friction before the Civil War, and Mainly the empire provokes the federation. After the Civil War, the two countries seem to have already formed a death, but they are not. The empire believes that it has triumphed. Under the highly unified cabinet, the citizens of the entire empire know that the empire has driven the evil invaders out of our homes, even though it has paid a price that has no effect on our lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation also felt that he had won, and finally found an opportunity to slap the landlord who lived next door and looked down on himself. He almost killed the landlord. Although some people have died, there are some that may continue to regret for centuries, but the empire’s tariff rights are taken by the federal government. Is there evidence that the federal is the winner? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such a strange propaganda paradox, the "friendliness" of the Civil War ended. After the end of the relationship, the relationship between the two countries is still relatively tight. As the tariff rights are about to expire, the federal side has released a good signal. For this reason, a "Monetary Memorandum of Understanding" has been signed to prove that the empire and the federal family are like a family. people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such an environment, large-scale wars will not break out in the future for a long time, and the awakening of international consciousness has made the empire and the federal Now this game is no longer two or three people open the room to play alone, is everyone gathered in a game hall called "international" to play together, then looking for a stronger ally is the best way to win a staged victory. No one is more suitable than the empire as a ally of the federation, just as no one is more suitable than the federal as an ally of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides poked each other with dirty water, and held the hands together tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of a federal consortium in the empire is definitely not a miracle, or a danger, this is a trend. The complementarity of international trade not only expands the channels and scope of their own operations for capitalists, but also allows them to have many opportunities that have not been seen before. Federal businessmen have come to the Empire to do business, and the merchants of the Empire have also gone to the Federation to do business. It is a good thing. The indispensable part of all commercial social and economic models is competition. The domestic commercial competition can no longer meet the needs of the major consortia. The joining of foreign forces and the broader boundaries are the guarantee for them to take it to the next level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can't stop it, then go along with this trend and then find a way to make yourself a leader or one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus’s thoughts are very mature. Of course, he also knows that Barr is just saying that he is mad, so he has not paid attention to the psychological changes of this old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bal in the silence while tasting the omelet of Magus, while drinking a slightly hot scented tea, he took the last piece and picked up the towel Wiping his hands, "The taste is very good, the tea is not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus glanced at him and looked at the plate with only a few crumbs left. I can't help but complain. "You often come to see me. I am very grateful, but can you come to see me after breakfast? I often go to work hungry, do you know?", he couldn't help but laugh. When I got up, I picked up the newspaper while laughing. "You should find a woman, so that is the real life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar's wife has passed away, God is She did not live for some time because she had a decisively different identity and status. She died of illness. It has been almost thirty years since then, and Baldo has not married anymore. Of course, sometimes he will find some skilled women to solve some personal expansion problems, but he absolutely does not allow anyone in his villa. Stay overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a man who loves his life to bloom only for a woman. Of course, there is no direct relationship between love and expansion. Love is love, expansion is expansion, not Because if you lose your wife, you will not expand. If you expand, you will not solve it. This is not what a normal person should do. The madman and metamorphosis do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bal’s indifferent attitude, he shrugged his shoulders. “I just like to take advantage of it! If you think that I am not doing this, you can hit me.” Magus said with a smile on his neuropathy, and then his eyes focused on another newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the prime minister of the Imperial Cabinet, the man with the highest power, he could not only read a newspaper, the newspaper in his hand also used the way newspapers were printed in the past. A lot of patterns are outlined on the side of the board, which is convenient for nobles to reflect their honor and difference when reading newspapers. There was a message in the newspaper that attracted Magus. The sacred consortium was guilty and was on the verge of disintegration. Mr. Old Cape finally closed his eyes forever after more than two months in the hospital bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contributors believe that the Kape family will face a lot of trouble in the next period of time. The biggest trouble comes from the investigation of the various departments of the empire. Once the investigation team finds evidence, the Cape family may have to roll over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this reporter did not catch the real focus. The biggest trouble for the Kape family is that they have not yet selected the real heir, Mr. Kapet, and they are finished. Now both children have the power and possibility to become a homeowner. Who is who? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a problem of family inheritance between brothers in civilian families. This is no longer just a question of wealth, but also a question of status and power. The loser sees the winner not only bows his head, but also speaks the honorific words, and even after being scolded, he will reveal a look like "You are too right." For the two competitors, the loser not only loses everything but also loses his dignity and personality, so no one will let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family infighting without disorder will only quickly consume the power of the family, and the Cape family will soon become a past tense, and this time it is implicated in the card. The Pei family's hymn consortium, one can't run, they have been targeted by Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The case of the Doolin and Cape family at the end of the month can be understood, just that I want to talk to him."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Talk to Du Lin?", Barr took out a cigarette and gave it to himself. "You haven't planned to give up that guy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Magnus reveals a trace of egg pain, "reluctant!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If he can do things wholeheartedly for this empire, at least one hundred years in the future There is no need to consider the status of the empire in the international arena. But the ambition of this young man is too big, too big...so big, I want to let him disappear. The most important thing is that he is still young. Young means that he has time and some opportunities to accomplish his pursuits and goals.”, Magus’s fingers flicked the newspaper, and Barr saw the content of the old Cappe’s closed eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, the Cape family is finished, it’s not because we or Doolin or anyone else has an absolute advantage in dealing with the Cape family, purely We live longer than him. If the old Cape is not dead, they and Doolin’s lawsuit will be torn down, and the hymn consortium will not split, and all this is because the old Cape is dead.”, Ma Gus said in a big breath that he had a mouthful to dry up. He picked up the teacup and took a sip of tea that was already cool. "He will die, we will die too. In the young people around us, we can't find it." A person who is about the same age as him and whose ability is similar to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
