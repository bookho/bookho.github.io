			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Roel was lying in a hospital bed, his face was pale and terrible, and several tubes were inserted in his mouth to help him maintain his life’s minimum needs. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His luck is good, the bullet penetrated his chest and shot through, according to the doctor, only one cent is his heart. I can see that the gunman is very professional, because many people don't really know where the human heart is, and it is even more impossible to play it in a hurry. Unfortunately, this professional gunman has lost his professional name because he did not succeed in killing Mr. Roel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The injury like this is definitely not recoverable in a short time. It takes at least a week to get a little better, and it will be a little worse after three or five months. The normal state, this is also fortunate in the misfortune, at least he is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a police station outside the ward, and there were several soldiers. An attack occurred outside the city hall in the city center, which has alarmed the Imperial Hub. The Ministry of Defence dispatched a team to rush here to prepare for the possible re-emergence of the attack, but also to investigate what caused the tragedy today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hospital’s dean’s office, the doorman sat sullenly on the chair of the dean, and the city hall, including the state government and the military, was Here. The attacks that took place today have caused the death of 19 innocent citizens and more than 100 injuries. This is also a blessing in misfortune. But everyone sitting here knows that this is definitely not a shooting case for killing, as if it was to warn some people through this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunmen can shoot at the upper body of people in the crowd, but they aim at people’s legs, and the 19 unlucky ones are not directly Most of the shots were killed by jumping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public opinion now refers directly to the doorkeeper, who believes that the doorman is the most likely behind-the-scenes black hand, that he made the attack, in order to pay less or even Do not pay more than two million compensation. This idea is also very common in the west. If the doorman pays the money, it means that he has cultivated it. Someone will immediately re-examine Mr. Roel’s method. If you create a mine disaster, you can earn one or two million. If the scale of the mine is bigger and the death toll is more, can you make more money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has ever overestimated the mine’s ethical index, which is not lacking for those who dare to gamble on their own lives and dare to gamble on others’ lives. "Adventurous" spirit. In the face of bankruptcy, there is nothing left, why not try to fight? This is also why people think that the doorman is behind the scenes. He wants to use this method to warn other people that some money is not so good, it will be hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, a military intelligence officer stood opposite the desk. He looked at the doorman with a serious look. "Mr. Mennon, I need your help. Please tell me who you think is most likely to be made. The attack? The Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet are very concerned about this matter. Before the situation expands, we should be able to solve this problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This soldier Is the person in the intelligence department of the Ministry of Defense. This department is called the National Security and Security Committee. Its main duty is to investigate and destroy any attempt to create military operations within the empire, to create separatist acts, and to include but not limited to violent acts such as armed riots and armed uprisings. department. Things like what happened today have obviously been included in the threat to national security. The Ministry of National Defense is very shocked. The Prime Minister, Prime Minister Magus, is also very angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an act that is absolutely intolerable in challenging the order of the empire and attempting to create a terrorist atmosphere to interfere with the normal operation of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mennon squinted and looked down at the hands on the table, and then slowly raised his head. "I only think of three possibilities." The forces have the strength to make this attack..." The soldier nodded, and the deputy next to him began to prepare for the record, indicating that he would continue to say, "The first force, the West Mine. The West Mine will gather in the West." Most mine owners have been trying to compete with the government. I believe that you and your assistants have also heard that each mine is an independent kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" They practiced their own laws in their own mining areas, modified their own sites according to their will, and also had a large number of armed personnel. I once negotiated with the Western Mining Association to collect the mine protection team and cancel the private armed forces. The matter, but was strongly opposed, this may be used as a reference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second force, the Tuss. You may not be clear This place in the west, the power of the Tushenism has been official The power is flat, even more than the official power. They have a large number of secret members, and it is highly probable that we have the gods of the gods in our seats. My 'three guarantees policy' and other benefits have hurt the interests of the gods. I have let more people into the camp of the empire, which has hurt the fundamental interests of this mysterious religion, and the Tushen has such power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You know, the gunman who shot Mr. Roel is actually one of my secretaries. It should be the one I trust the most, but he betrayed me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The third force...", Mennon’s eyes flashed a hint of haze. "Don't you know if you heard of a young man named Doolin? He operated a huge smuggling network on the East Coast, some time ago. When he was the mayor of Otis, he was dismissed and went to the west. I am not sure if he has such a motive, but if he wants to say that he can carry out the attack, he may be a direction. He has enough people, there are There is enough money and influence, including weapons and everything, he has what he has."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can only think of these three possibilities I also hope that you can make the power or individual of this tragedy. I also hope that you can restore the truth of the matter as soon as possible, give me a fair result to the City Hall and the Kadima Party!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who is most likely to do this kind of thing in the eyes of the peasant is most likely to be the darling of Doolin. He is as neurotic as his father, and his brain is absolutely problematic. The whole family goes from top to bottom. They all inherit a crazy factor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still remembers very clearly that they just made a big sale many years ago - a common saying is that they killed a nobleman and plundered the nobility. The property, and incited the slave riots in the aristocratic territory. When they returned to the temporary camp and recruited a businessman who had been working with them for more than two years, the businessman just made a joke. As a result, the guy who had a close relationship with the organization was sent by Mr. Xema. Heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of counting the property, I didn’t know who asked, what was the most valuable in the camp, the businessman smiled and said of course Mr. The mask is the most valuable. Almost everyone wants to look at what a face is under the mask, and then there is a hole in his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin must have inherited the crazy blood of Mr. Xema, it is very likely that this thing is really what he did, to know Zyma Mr. Seeing that he has been pleasing to the eye, this sentiment is likely to be transmitted to Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But... this is really not what Du Lin did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin knew that he was shocked afterwards. He did want to kill the doorman for two reasons. The first reason was that the farmer planned and implemented the kidnapping case of abduction of Alisa and his son. Although he was defeated by Mr. Kemma, he did it after all! Therefore, Dooling must be revenge. If this hatred is not revenged, Mr. Xema will look down on him, and all those who know will look down on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
