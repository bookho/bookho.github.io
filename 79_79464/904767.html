			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the arrival of autumn, the north has already begun the prelude to cooling down. As the city of Otis, which is close to the south, has begun to cool down, the workers on the site are still sweating. But they don't need iced tea anymore to help them get rid of the heat. On the contrary, whenever there is a gust of wind blowing, they will feel a hint of chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men in suits and trousers came out from the station, the meticulous hair reflected the light of the sun like a diamond, they waited for a while, a car stopped In front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wind in this place is too big." It was thought that the middle-aged man in his forties complained that he took out a handkerchief and wiped the shoes. Dust on the stain, then shake the window with your hand and throw the handkerchief out of the gap. It's a high-end handkerchief worth five dollars, but it's just a worthless consumable for someone like him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His name is Soro Pand Kumir Saint-Cape, after removing his grandfather and past territories and surnames representing theocracy, It can be a tower for Mr. Soro Cape. As one of the leaders of the Hymn family, he was sent to the city of Otis to fight for a complete power card from Doolin. Sometimes the world is so funny, whether it is a former clergyman, a later aristocrat, or a current consortium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They should all bear more social responsibilities than others and lead people to be positive, but they are the first to stand up and want to get a gambling card. People. There is no doubt that this family name carries a "sacred" family and wants to run the devil's business in this new era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three heirs in this generation of hymns. As for other brothers and sisters, they also need to compete for 13 percent of the shares in their hands. For this reason, the three elites of 30s and 40s have been running outside. This time Solo was able to grab the opportunity to get Doolin’s consent, or his uncle helped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many unacceptable things in the big family, so even the most bizarre and absurd legends can't describe two-thirds. His uncle is his father's younger brother and his mother's cousin. In order for the power of the family not to be lost, in order to ensure that the power of the family is always in the hands of the family, all of them must be close relatives to marry. Want to marry someone outside? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but it is not a marriage, but a business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exchanging the power of each other's family, or going out of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no third way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Soro can be the next owner, he can get a 13% stake in the hands of the owner, plus he and his parents probably have About 19 points, it is already the most powerful one in the family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premise is that he must complete each task, including getting a gambling card that is very important to the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire is gambling, which makes many people with a sense of smell immediately realize that a profit storm is coming. Even paying a high special tax will leave an amazing profit. In the past, the pursuit of the hymn family was always endless power. In this new era, they pursued the ultimate profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this era, politicians can enjoy what they can enjoy. What politicians can't enjoy, they can also enjoy it, provided they have money and a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary of the car Solo, the "young man" in his early thirties opened the folder in his hand, "Now the city of Otis has a total of sixty-nine At the construction site and the 12 buildings that have just been completed, we estimate that from the beginning of next year to the middle of next year, the city of Otis will have more than 150 new buildings, no more than three years, and the bustling degree here will far exceed Emperor. So not only is the sandstorm very large now, the wind and sand will not be too small in two years.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why don’t we help the agent to win the mayor’s position here? ", I heard the secretary around him gave an answer that made him move, he was a little curious. If the city of Otis has such great potential, then it is entirely possible to push a political agent to become the mayor of Otis, and then indirectly grasp the city. The cities that are swallowed by them will not spit out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary knows that Soro doesn’t know much about the things here, and patiently explains that this is his job,” Du Lin from Magus I got a brand from the SAR, and many people are paying attention to the situation here. Magus used this as a test base for the policy. He took the experiment with Du Lin and the people here, so we couldn’t pass other ways. Involved in the transfer of personnel in the city of Otis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unless Magus stepped down and replaced a prime minister who had worked with us to take charge of the cabinet, we had the opportunity to arrange the manpower here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He smiled. "Although we can't send our people, we can try to contact the next mayor, maybe he is happy to join us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the next one selected?", Soro does not seem to be surprised by the secretary. In fact, everyone has long known that except for the general election, appointments at other times are only appointments, not elections. So it is an accident that Du Lin’s successor has not been selected. “Who is it? Do I know?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“is a small aristocrat named Donald There is no backstage, but his origins are good. He once worked hard for the royal family and has a sense of identity with the aristocratic class. I believe that we will have a pleasant meeting as long as the method is appropriate."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The talking car has slowly stopped. Zheng hall, after a parked car drivers will push secretary immediately out the door, around to the other side for the Solomon opened the door, and held out his hand to Solomon borrowed a little force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These columns are good, I like it very much." He raised his makeup while he raised his head. "If their surface can be layered." Gold foil is even better, so more stylish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo's ancestors are priests, and priests always like something magnificent. The secretary just showed a smile of approval, and did not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two entered the town hall and registered with the guard. They were led by a young man to the outside of Du Lin’s office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is thinking about the composition of the power of the casino at this time, the big forces are not small, the small forces can't have one, only the big forces can get together with each other. It works, even if Magus comes, there is no way. At this time, someone knocked on the door. He reached out and gestured. The knock on the door sounded again. He only patted his head. Dove was "evented out" to find the press officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the seat to open the door and saw two gentlemen who had not seen him. Although they had not seen these two people, Du Lin knew that these two people were not Rich is expensive. The clothes they wear and the accessories they wear are not cheap. They can wear tens of thousands of pieces on the body. He has at least millions or even tens of millions of foundations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Mr. Doolin, I am Ornes, this is Mr. Soro, Solo Cape, I am his secretary.", Ornes mentioned the name of Cape when he couldn’t help With a chin, this surname has great prestige in the empire. Except for the nobility and the great aristocrats who have a far more distant family history than the hymns, this surname is absolutely respectable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Soro." Du Lin smiled and reached out. "I just noticed the documents you submitted. I didn't expect you to come." So fast, please come in!", he let the two people come in and let them get some coffee - the rest of the morning is heated again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo and O'Neill thanked and re-settled, Du Lin was sitting opposite them, the new mayor's office was more luxurious than the previous one, inside The furniture is also very luxurious, and the city hall does not lack a few dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have been in contact with your secretary, but it seems that the lady has left the job?" Ornes explained why they suddenly visited. After all, it’s rude to not say hello to Du Lin. The average person may not care about this, but their aristocrats are very concerned about etiquette and ceremonial feelings. "Our itinerary has been booked before, so it is very risky to visit you today because we are leaving at night. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin waved his hand. "You're welcome, I am not a palace here, I can come anywhere anytime."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp In the whole process, Solo was like a sculpture, but now that he has not spoken to him, the current communication is done by Ernest, when their opinions are agreed. Soro will open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, our time is very tight, I will tell you the truth. I don’t know what your requirements and opinions are for our demands? If not We hope to get this result as soon as possible. After all, we are very busy, and you have a lot of things to deal with.", Ernes Irian's sincere expression is like thinking for Du Lin, but his eyes are hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singer consortium has taken a fancy to your business. It is your privilege. It is not a good thing to hold your position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled apologetically, "Are you saying a gambling card?", Ornes nodded, and Du Lin was shaking his head. "I am very sorry, I can't Promise your request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
