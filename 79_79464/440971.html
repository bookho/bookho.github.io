			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mason, your assessment passed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. The heavy portfolio was thrown onto the table, as he expected, when a puppy scorpion climbed out of the nest, the remaining puppies could not be willing to stay in the nest. Their curiosity about the world will force them to overcome all difficulties and difficulties and climb out bravely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doolin left home, the first one to stand out was Mr. Mamma’s eldest son, Mason Xema. He secretly carried Mr. Kemma to the town and cast a "CV". He wanted to be a police officer. In short, he listed all the experiences he had been able to show off in his life, and then spent two. I am very pleased to ask an old drunk who can write on the paper for him to write on paper. When he was in the dark, he stuffed the paper into the door of the sheriff's house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to be a policeman, it is best to be a sheriff, after all, for the children in the country, those who can wear a uniform with a badge It is so cool. If you can become a policeman, there will be many girls who can't help but fall in love with themselves. Every time they think of this Mason, they will not be able to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if the bastard has revealed the news, Mason thinks it should be the drunkard who can’t help but say all the alcoholic people who know everything. The mouth, in short, he wants to be a police officer, it is known to the people in the whole town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last time, Mr. Kesma did not feel as angry as Dulin’s choice to leave the family to go outside, he just calmly put Mason I called out of the house and looked at him very seriously. "Mason, my child, are you sure you want to be a policeman, not inheriting my farmland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mason was a little afraid, and Mr. Kesma’s prestige in the family surpassed that of God, so Mason was very scared, but when he thought of Dulling’s decision before leaving, he realized that this was his last chance. Because once he cringes, he will not have another chance to get rid of this life like a sly life. In the end, he will become a farmer who has been farming in the countryside for the rest of his life like Mr. Kesma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the life he longs for, he doesn’t want to be a farmer, he wants to resist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he nodded hard. "Yes father, I want to be a policeman, a sheriff, and even one day I will go to the city to become the director of a police station. I don't like to be a farmer, I hate it. The smell of feces."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma’s mouth squinted, revealing a not so good-looking smile, he patted Mason’s shoulder, “I let Du Lin Leaving and pursuing his dreams, then I can't stop you from looking for your direction. I agree, but you have to figure out that if you need to be busy, you still need to work with us." He took out a cigarette of his own volume from his pocket and took a sip after it. "You can now take your cover and roll to the security guard. Also, remember to come back to eat every day."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason’s excited body trembled, and he never imagined the serious Mr. Xema, and Mr. Xema, who did not allow anyone to object, would be so open-minded. one day. His excited tears are coming out, saying thank you, clasping his hands and kissing his thumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma smiled a few words and came over Mason’s head. “Don’t pack any more, you may want to be in this place that you don’t like. Place, stayed for one night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to pack things now!", Mason immediately rushed into the narrow attic and began to pack up his things. Mrs. Kesma looked at Mr. Kemma with some doubts, and the confusion in her eyes allowed Mr. Kemas to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can never drink the water according to the will of the cow, even if it drowns in the sink, it does not want to drink, it will not drink." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason quickly packed up some simple salutes. The weather is not too cold now, just a light quilt. He took the portfolio on the table with his badge and some documents. After he embraced Mr. Kesma and Mrs. Kesma, he bid farewell to his brothers and sisters and left the house immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma sat back on the chair that represented his family's identity, tilting his legs, laughing and laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idiot, Doolin left to go to a very distant city, and he? Still in the town, it also eased the burden on the family. When working, Mr. Kemer did not mind holding a stick to bring him back to work. Moreover, Mr. Kesma thinks that Mason will not be able to take the initiative to come back for up to a month. If he has not been a policeman in the countryside, he will definitely go mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Doolin certainly did not know that his brother had actually become a country policeman with a badge on his chest. If he knows, he may have other ideas, but even if he tells him, it is too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tomorrow after dawn, the wine will be shipped to the warehouse of the station, and the next day, according to Morris, he will take away the belonging to Doolin. pasture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris may not be aware that he is interfering with a big deal with a profit of more than 100,000. For this 100,000, if several people go to see it God, must God forgive me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killing in Du Lin’s eyes is getting stronger and stronger. He is not a person who likes to use this means to solve troubles. Killing a person is indeed the easiest way to solve the problem. This can not make a person, let a company have any growth, but will become a barrier in the future. Because you can't always solve all the troubles in the way of killing, there are always people who don't dare to kill and kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thoughts fall into the stupid circuit of "Whoever kills me, I will kill you," it means that a person has reached the limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin doesn't want to kill, but sometimes, there are always people who have to choose the least favorite means to kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day after dawn, Du Lin arranged for the Buddha and several young people to stalk. He believes that everyone’s activities are regular, maybe three The time of the day is not too much, but the general law can definitely be felt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Romais, I want to ask a question...", Du Lin sat in the office of a lawyer's office, he faced One of the best lawyers in the city of Tener, Kevin Romes. Kevin is a very successful lawyer with a high degree of education and a wealth of litigation experience. As long as the money is given, he can do his best, even if he violates conscience and morality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a period of time in the Tener City Public High School, a scandal broke out. A math teacher has been sexually assaulting three girls in a single-parent family. Hey, one of the girls was discovered by the family only seven months after the pregnancy, and the scandal broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reasonable to say that such a case is basically a nail, and it is impossible to have any repetition. But the middle school math teacher hired Kevin at a great price, and Kevin actually helped him successfully reverse the case in court, "the three underage girls are curious about sex, and the lack of fatherhood from childhood has a love for the teacher." In order to seduce the teacher, this is the same reason for the shit, helping the mathematics teacher to sue the crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The math teacher was released in court after paying a fine, and the pregnant girl among the three underage girls, from the fifth floor of the hospital a week later Jumped down, one corpse and two lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This case caused a huge sensation, even the authoritative newspapers in the capital carried out the entire report, and severely condemned the city of Tener. The court, and the ethical conscience of Kevin Romax's lawyer. Unlike mainstream media and values, in the entire legal profession, Kevin has become the star of tomorrow in this industry where successful entry is a high society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will not be possible, and this is what all capitalists and rich people are pursuing. It is said that the three major law firms in the capital sent an invitation letter to Kevin, inviting him to join the three largest law firms in the empire as the main litigator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it’s just that he nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin is very gentle and very well-dressed. The first side can make people feel good and have some inexplicable trust. . Perhaps this is one of the reasons why he can succeed. His appearance is extremely deceptive. When he smiled, Du Lin felt that this guy's smile was as dazzling as the sun. It was a damn guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the conversation, I need to declare to you that my personal consultation fee is $60 per hour, if it involves analysis and some copywriting work... "With a shy smile, he stretched out his fingers and shouted. "It has to be doubled, that is, one hundred and twenty yuan an hour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "And, call me Kevin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin snorted. "What conditions do lawyers need? I think you earn more than me." More." Kevin knew that this was a joke, so he didn't answer, and he pressed it on a clock on the table, and the second hand immediately ticking and turning. Du Lin smiled and shook his head. "Okay, okay, I know, time has begun, one minute, one dollar, and the black scorpion, you are more terrible than the capitalist!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
