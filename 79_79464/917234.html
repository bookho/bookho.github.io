			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are here!", Mr. John put together the corners of his sleeves and said to his butler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire plan steward was involved and helped Mr. John do a lot of cover-up and arrangement. Mark told Mr. John that the feature was burned and he woke up. The first reaction was that someone had to start with the George family. Mr. John is more aware than Mark or Arthur and his brothers and sisters. The root of the George family lies in the three special publications. Once the three feature agencies had a flaw, they quickly shake the foundation of the George family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe they can rebuild the feature agency, but at that time, the right to speak in the field of newspapers is not necessarily in their hands, only a short time In a few days, someone will stand up and do a full job of overthrowing the George family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts do prove this. The reason why Mr. John did not immediately "wake up" is that he hopes to bring in more opponents, but also by his own coma. Wake up the facts and let some people change their initial plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who drive the whole event may have prepared a more decisive and rude way to break the foundation of the George family, but he is unconscious, these people Will slow down a little. Eating in the cruel capital world is also a very important scoring point. It is not ugly to eat the stomach, and it is the thing that all capitalists pursue. It is the idea of ​​Mr. John that leads to more enemies and disrupts the enemy's plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all the enemies that should appear. When these people start to swear on the napkins, he is appearing and disrupting these people’s plans again. Let all their steps go. Only in this way can the George family reinvigorate. It’s no longer important that Du Lin did this, because in the eyes of Mr. John, Du Lin and the enemy have already drawn the equal sign. He may be just a pioneer, a vanguard, a cause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Mr. John was about to push the door out of the "patient room", the phone ringing suddenly rang, he frowned and walked over to pick up The phone, "This is George Manor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound in the receiver is a bit weird, the other party is doing a good job of preparing, may be afraid to be monitored, "before During a few days of cabinet meetings, Magus proposed a new bill, and the Cabinet and the Ministry of Justice improved the content. This bill is called the Anti-Industry Manipulation Act and has been sent to the Imperial Parliament..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. John’s face has changed a bit, and only the name of the bill can be used to guess the general content. He covered the microphone and turned to look at the housekeeper and asked, "What day is it today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler told him without hesitation, today is Monday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Yesterday was Sunday, so Mark initially placed the time of the conference on Sunday, and the conference was held during non-working hours and will not delay these newspapers. The president has too much working time. It was a pity that something went wrong, so that it was dragged to the next day, that is, it was held in the open house of the George family today, so today is Monday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday is a very ordinary day and a very uncommon day, because this is the first working day of the week, many companies and official departments will Regular meetings and arrangements for a week of work. Similarly, Monday, the second week of October, is also the day of the Imperial Parliament in the fourth quarter of each year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Assembly is held four times a year according to its charters and practices, and the second week of the first month of each quarter is the day of the Imperial Parliament. This meeting will follow the content process, and the length of the meeting will vary from one day to five days. In addition, if you encounter a very special situation, you can also hold an ad hoc meeting. The temporary meeting only needs 35% of the members to be present, and the normal meeting requires 70% of the members to be present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John already had some guesses in his heart. He lowered his voice and asked, "What about the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It has already been passed, it is entered into the Empire Code, some members are discussing whether to include this bill in the Basic Law. I owe you the human condition is over, I wish you good luck, old John."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of a phone call was cut off, and John slammed the phone a little. He thought that his opponents and enemies would not be too much, and he was his own old enemy. Capitalists who are surrounded by sharks are not enemies. Being attracted to their interests is only their nature. Once stabilized, they will naturally recede. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all fairness, if he encounters such an opportunity, he will also kneel on the edge of the table with a knife and fork, waiting for the moment to grab the seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he never thought that it would involve Magus, who proposed such a bill and passed it in the Imperial Parliament. To say that this bill has nothing to do with his George family, the old guy is willing to bet with his own head. After living for so long, his political sense is definitely the most sensitive one, and this thing is absolutely related to him. But why suddenly the new party’s top executives will start with the Georges? He didn't want to understand a bit. He was sitting on the edge of the bed and his brain was faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a serious problem? Why is the whole world suddenly different? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked himself that he had never sinned the top of the new party. No matter what kind of political news, he allowed the editor and editor-in-chief of the feature society to guarantee political neutrality. The position has never favored any politician and has not tended to any political party. People say that the George family's report is the most timely and fair, which is the main reason why the George family survived to this day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He considered whether it would be because of the problem of the standing team, for example, reporting some news that is detrimental to the image of the New Party, but he has always been very cautious in this regard. This fatal error will never occur. Including the transaction between Mark and Doolin, he was also stirred up by him. The purpose is to ensure that the George family is always outside the political arena. They will not have any position and will always stand in a neutral perspective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, sometimes the position of guaranteeing neutrality is itself a subjective position, especially in politics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three camps in politics, black and white. For those big men, the neutral George family is the grayest one. His assurances have a neutral stance, but there is also a sentence in politics: if it is not a friend, it must be an enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a positive expression of the sentence, there is no "bystander" in the political struggle, or everyone is their own, or the enemy, no neutrality At that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the George family has the attributes of "politics" is related to the business they run, and that is the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the mainstream media platform in the world today, newspapers are more important to politics than any other industry. From small to politicians attacking each other, to the swaying between political parties, it is inseparable from such a voice. But now this way is not in the hands of any politician party, but is firmly controlled by an "outsider", which makes many politicians feel uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I advocated my political idea by the way, and smashed my political opponents. When I saw the newspaper, I didn’t have any words. The attack on the political platform of the other party was gone, and the words of the other family members were gone. Only my own political ideas were left. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those politicians at the bottom of the political arena, this kind of newspaper with no obvious orientation and position is a good newspaper, but for the need to pass the newspaper, and the newspaper as For the big men who attacked political opponents, this neutral model is a cancer in politics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They need a newspaper with more obvious inclinations and positions to do their best to criticize political opponents, curse political enemies, revil political opponents, and have no bottom line to sing their own great achievements. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the George family is also the best tycoon under the knife, the newspaper tycoon and other industry tycoons are a little different, other industry tycoons are not so easy to Fallen. For example, the railway tycoon Colliers, if not he himself fell, can someone else pour him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secretly dig a railway? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you still pay for the construction of a new railway network with a larger total number of kilometers and a larger area? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impossible, this kind of person can only make Collier feel the crisis if he falls down on his own or if there is another strong competitor. Have the opportunity to fall down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others can't do it. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not to mention those steel tycoons, he has dozens of bombers in a steel mill, and he can sell ore in all steel mills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The George family is different. There are only three special publications in this family. Their roots are not deeply implanted in the ground, but exposed to the air. That's why Mr. John hasn't felt that he is actively expanding his printing business before he is old. In fact, he had a sense of crisis at that time. Unfortunately, the inter-banking was not so good. It would not only lead to the egg, but also the sharp proportion of the egg to pierce the egg, so that the egg white was scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this hidden bomb has finally exploded. For Magus, the George family is just an appetizing soup, using the Anti-Industry Manipulation Act to kill a famous industry. Tycoon's deterrence against large trust companies and syndicates will be fatal, which will also benefit the empire's control and restraint of capitalists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
