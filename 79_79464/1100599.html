			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Du Lin brought Natiya to the study and asked her to sit in the chair next to her. "What did you drink?" Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya shook her head and looked a little better, but there was still some frustration. In fact, such things have happened in the past, and more than once, but the same thing brings different feelings in different time periods. When I was a child, I was playing on the ground while playing with mud. I thought this might be the most interesting thing when I played the pinball, but when I was growing up, I tried to remember to remember the past. I couldn’t find much literature except I felt stupid. The touch in the work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natya, who was still in the early stages of life, thought it might be normal to climb up. I will give you what you want, you give me the chance, this is A deal. But when you are loyal to your family after you get married, you will encounter this problem again. It is not a transaction or an insult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fruit, thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took two glasses of wine, he stood half Sitting at the table, a cup gave Natiya, a cup of oneself. During this time, Natiya helped him save a lot of effort. He didn't need him to personally talk with the group of capital tycoons, so that he had more time to adjust the arrangement details and meet more important big men. Her work is very efficient and professional, especially in the banking sector. There are many professional people around Du Lin... Well, there are not many. Natiya will make up for the shortcomings of the lack of high-end talents in the economy. It is also the most crucial position for him to buy people, so he needs to adjust. she was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said this before, if you are good to a person, then you must let him/her know who is doing it, everyone will There are unrealistic fantasies. If you don't want your credit to be installed on someone else's head, it's best to do things and then explain the words. Only the person who is doing the right thing is the human condition, and it is done quietly, that is... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, Du Lin, I’ve got things done." Natiya was a little uncomfortable, except for the idea of ​​Alan Duy’s bastard, Nati Ya knows how important the current 600 million federal shield is for Du Lin. This is a huge sum of money, enough to incite more things. She has already known Du Lin's plans. She can't imagine that a young man actually thinks about attacking a country's finances, but in the process of working, she thinks that this may really be possible. It is also because she feels that it is possible to have some guilt and not to do things well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a sip of the wine in the glass and shook his finger. "No, he will come to my estate to apologize to you within a week and send the money to my hand."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya suddenly looked up and looked at Du Lin incredibly. She thought that Du Lin was talking about madness, and maybe she wanted to comfort her. Sensual animals can always be inadvertently poked at that point, her eyes are a little moved to see Du Lin, can not believe to ask, "How is this ... possible? Alan Duy Lian in Farolanco The royal family did not give face, how could he come back to apologize?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and said: "When you break into his key points, in order to survive him Even Lieutenants are willing to eat, let alone apologize?" Du Lin turned and returned to his desk and took out a cigarette. "Do you know why today, including the last time you would be humiliated by him?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a scar, and Du Lin suddenly changed the subject and uncovered the scar that was just a little better, which made Natiya more uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her head down and not talking, Du Lin smiled. "Because you have never been a real big man, you are not ready to be A big man, both psychologically and emotionally. I will help you with this matter, but this is not a good solution. I hope that one day this slap is not for me, but for you. Go to pumping. First you need to grow up, you have to tell yourself that you are serving Du Lin, serving the most powerful people in the future of the empire, and you are a big man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With the mentality of a big man, with the ambition of a big man, you can discover that this world is actually like this! When you expose your minions, the wild dogs that are licking your teeth will run away with their tails. They just look terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I donated 100 million to the Imperial Navy, and soon Mr. Alan Duy would understand that in the real In the world of the strong, he comes from the corner of the planet. Nobility, are not worth a damn! ", Turin sonorous words made Nati Ya lost in thought while also were shocked by his generous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked down at the glass of her hands and her heart was ups and downs, "Is it worth it? Do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not?", Du Lin's powerful counter-inquiry asked Natiyah not to know how to answer. "It is a shame to humiliate you, he must pay the price!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
