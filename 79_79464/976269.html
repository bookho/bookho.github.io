			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunny morning, if the temperature can be a little higher, of course, if you can have a cup of coffee and screaming coffee..., of course, if It would be nice to have another dried beef. If... there is another woman! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mine guard sits on the whistle tower with his cold rifle in his arms, his eyes moving around the labor camp. The temperature in the west has dropped to freezing point, and the outdoor temperature is about minus 15 degrees. The cold wind slams into the gap along the gap between the clothes, just like the moment when life was born. Full of emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside is very cold, but the mine is not so cold, the higher the temperature, the temperature is about seven to ten in the current mining stage. Between degrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an iron ore with a medium iron content. Last year, the iron ore owner’s income was about 700,000. This year, a batch of 600 people was added. The slaves, these slaves were shipped from the west coast a few days ago and are in the period of adaptation. Therefore, the mine protection team on the iron mine can not eat the beef in the warm room, eat the beef and discuss the girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the experience of the past years, these new slaves are often the most vulnerable, after they have adapted to the environment in a short time, Start thinking about how to escape, how to go home or expose everything here. According to the experience of the western mine owners, one hundred slaves eventually survived, and no more than forty people can work honestly. The rest was not hanged because of escape, but because of missing his hometown or other reasons, he was infected with the disease and died here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you can survive the first half-year period, the next management will be relatively easy, and all those who are lucky enough to want to go home will see the camp. The black-red cross and the dried body above will naturally be honest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the guardian of the camp was a little sleepy on the guard tower, the hoarse hooves in the distance made him wake up, he Looking out of the camp, more than a dozen horses spewed a whisper of white air on the cold ground and quickly rushed towards the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are cars in the west, and many cities have many cars, but people are still willing to ride horses in the wild, and the ghosts know if those cars will meet in the wild. Some problems can't be acted upon, for example, the stone in the grass has smashed the chassis, or suddenly collapsed on the seemingly stable ground. The longer the journey, the lower the safety factor of the vehicle, and the expensive cars will not tell you where there is water, and wherever you can go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Ma can, they can find the source of water, can find the direction of going home, which is very important for people walking in the endless Gobi and even the desert area in the western core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mine guard on the sentry tower immediately picked up a corded phone and snorted, and immediately came out of the villa area separated from the miners’ camp. Come, they walked with guns at the gate of the camp. When they first arrived at the gate of the camp, the guests also went outside the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is the industry of Andorra mining, who are you looking for?", the captain of the mine protection team stood in the door and looked at these thick clothes with a gaze The fur guests did not open the door immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Stables have their own way of living here, and it seems that there is no one in the Gobi, and there are many people hiding in it. They swindled the door, and the next moment they suddenly rushed out and poured into the camp, washed the blood up and down, and then went on and waited for the auction to get the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy with a certain hat jumped from the horse immediately. He went outside the iron gate and took off his hat, revealing all his faces, then Say loudly: "We have contacted Mr. Andorra. This time I came to talk about business. You can go to Mr. Andorra to verify."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will then "Do it!", the captain of the mine protection team told the team to look at these people, then turned and ran back to the villa area quickly. After a while, he ran back and opened the door. "Mr. Andorra is waiting for you inside, please ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aellis nodded and put on his hat again. He took the horse into the iron gate and handed the reins in his hand to Those members of the mine protection team. They know how to take care of these big babies in the winter, especially in the winter. These horses that have been running for a long time have already sweated a lot. If they are directly driven into the stables, they will not do any treatment. In the most days, these horses will be Will get sick and die. They first wiped the sweat on the skin of these horses with a dry big towel, then brushed it several times with a horse brush and then wiped it again. After taking the special cotton cover from the saddle, it was put on the horse and sent to the delicate The refined grain replenishes the horse and there will be some coarse grains later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, some of the problems that people and horses need to face in nature are basically the same. They can't eat too much, and they can't eat too badly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the largest and most luxurious villa in the camp area, the group saw the mine owner, Mr. Andorra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Andorra is in his forties, with thick hair, a pair of gray eyes, and an impressive hook nose. He sat in a formal costume and greeted the visitors, but after carefully scrutinizing these people, he couldn't help but wonder: "Don't Mr. Doolin come?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Averys clicked. "Yes, I am very sorry Mr. Andorra. Mr. Doolin was unable to get out of time because he had some urgent things. He asked me to convey my apologies for this. I also hope that you can understand that when he is busy with his hands, he will come to see you personally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andorra’s face is a bit strange, his brow is slightly Pick, smile, "It doesn't matter, it's not an important thing anyway, as long as you can be the master of Mr. Doolin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin wants to buy Andorra The iron ore mine, which has been mined for seven years, can continue to mine for five to ten years, according to geologists. Although there will still be output after five years, the ore output at that time is far worse than it is now. This is a vein that has entered the mining countdown and has a certain value, but the value is not great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andorra knew that it was through Mr. Jack's matchmaking, and Mr. Jack's poker organization operated more than a dozen mines in the western part of the Empire. Some mines do have stable output and can bring benefits to the organization. This is a normal and normal investment, but some mines have long had no output and can still be “profitable”. This is a very common means of money laundering. Through the false purchase of ore by different companies in your own hands, the money is sold, and after paying a tax, the sale of “ore” money becomes a clean money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This money will enter certain companies in the form of investment according to the requirements of customers, or will be remitted to the bank accounts of other countries through legal channels. What will happen in the future is that things outside the business will not be questioned by the poker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin revealed that he wanted to buy a few mines, and did not ask for the output, quality, etc. of the mine. Mr. Jack introduced him a lot. Andorra is one of the mine owners interested in selling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this iron ore will continue to generate revenue in the future, Mr. Andorra’s idea is to take a large sum of money and advance the future profits. And then continue to invest in industries with higher return on investment and better prospects. Such people are actually very common in the west. Mining is only a means for them to get rich. After the rich, they will find ways to enter other industries, because the scale and development of the mining industry limits the return rate of the next stage, just like Luke. I earned a lot of money and thought about jumping out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
