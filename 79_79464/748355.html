			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, now your compatriots are confronting our police in the fourth district. The mayor has commissioned me to communicate with you. I hope that you as a guer. A small number of successful people and outstanding people can stand up at this special time and shoulder the great responsibility given to you by society and nation. You should be aware that once the riots really happen, the Navy will intervene in the crackdown. We have no right to ask the Navy. Obeying our orders, this will inevitably be a tragic conflict with bloodshed and sacrifice. So no matter who you are, please do something!”, the person who spoke is the office worker of the city hall, this time the incident broke out. It was so sudden that the riots broke out suddenly when no one was prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, until now, the City Hall has only defined this group of angry gualts who want to gather together to do something to define riots. The riots are only a little worse. Once defined as a riot, local troops are immediately involved in intervening. In general, armed repression is the most popular thing for all military forces. There is no danger in suppressing these unarmed ordinary people, and they are on the side of justice. After the end of the crackdown, they will not only receive rewards from the ruling empire, but also awards from the military. There is no more cost-effective war than this. Behavior". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the City Hall is not willing to see such a thing happen. Ilyan is a tourist city with tourism as its main economic pillar. More than half of the residents of Irian provided jobs and provided sufficient taxes for the managers of Irian. Once the riots occur, even if they are suppressed immediately, but the impact has already been caused, the number of tourists coming here will drop sharply in the next period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not a large number of tourists, meaning that some small factories and handicraft workshops will close down, and a large number of socially unemployed people who have lost their jobs will cause social unrest, The destruction of the security and prosperity of the Irian region has entered a vicious circle, making visitors who are waiting to see more unwilling to come to Irian. At that time, if you want to recover the lost impression points, you can definitely do it in one or two sentences, and the economic value of the loss will be tens of millions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders and said slowly: "I understand what you and the city hall mean, but you should know that I have only been in the city for half a year. The time has not been fully integrated into the people of this city. I am too far from them..." He crossed a long distance, and the guy from the City Hall also smiled. "So you said let I am going to calm the riot, I am very grateful to you and the City Hall for their personal attention, but how do you feel that I should calm down? I don't know any of them, I don't even know what they want to achieve, if only I can stand in front of them and calm down the riots, then we will leave now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said that it is not bad. A manor who can buy a house worth 350,000 yuan can open a jewellery store in the first district. How can he bend to join the inferior people in the fifth district? The gap between the two is like the gap between the white clouds and the soil under the feet. There is no comparability at all. But the problem is that Du Lin is the only one who can take care of them now. At least Du Lin has some responsibility in this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This staff member, Scott, took a sigh of relief and converges his face with a slight, forward-looking attitude with a bit of coercive attitude and tone. The body said: "Mr. Doolin, you may not know, the root cause of the riots broke out by your people is that they suspect that you murdered their spokesperson, Mr. Abigail. If the riots can calm down as soon as possible Going down is a good thing for you, the government and the Guarts. A successful solution will not leave any sequelae. But if there is a bloodshed, the City Hall must give all Ilyan an explanation, a reasonable explanation. At that time, the crimes of all relevant personnel will be traced and a fair judgment will be given!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled in disregard, he took out a cigarette On the mouth, Jose immediately stepped forward to set fire to him, spit a smog, and Du Lin squinted at the smoke. "I know a guy named Kevin. He has never lost a lawsuit. I still Meet the members of the Chamber of Commerce, I am a friend, I have many other friends, I believe they will not sit and watch me being trapped."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if they don't care, I still have Money, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of Du Lin couldn’t help but smile, Scott’s face was as ugly as someone pulled in his soup pot. A bubble. Just as Scott was about to turn his face, Du Lin’s voice turned and he came back. “Although I am not afraid of any filth and jealousy to me, you are doing well, as a socially responsible Guar. I have to stand up at this critical moment and take on the part of the responsibility that the society has given me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a word, Scott has no temper, saying It’s hard to listen to you. It’s you who said it’s good to you. It’s you who threaten me. It’s also you who are holding me. How about you want to step on the horse? Of course, he wouldn’t say these psychological words. He just smiled and nodded and praised Du Lin’s sense of responsibility. “You are a rich man with a conscience. We welcome you to be in Irian and treat you here as If you have any needs, you can contact me directly or you can contact the City Hall and the Advisory Board directly, we will be happy to solve the problem for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"I just have a problem..." Du Lin took the hat from Jose. "I heard that Irian issued medals for some outstanding citizens every year, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott smiled again, and he nodded and said, "I will pass on your opinion to the above. As for whether I can pass it, I can't interfere."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin promptly reached out and held it tightly with him. "Thank you for your personal visit and help to me. In the days to come, you will find that I am a very "People who are getting along."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two went together and walked, and Scott asked curiously: "So how do you plan to calm the riot? Sorry, I am really curious. As you said, you don’t know one of them, but if you want to solve the riot, I really can’t think of any better ideas.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will know after the meeting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Scott led Du Lin toward the mayor's office, he whispered a little anxiously. "Are you not going to the fourth district? Why do you want to come to the mayor's office at this time? The situation there will be anytime, anywhere. Outbreak, time is running out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin replied as he walked, "I don't know if you have heard of it, smart hunters will use it." A week to prepare for the trap, the stupid hunter will chase the prey for a week. I am here to solve the riot better and faster, not to delay the time."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott has seen the extent to which Du Lin’s mouth is slippery, and he cleverly chooses to close his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor is a man of forty years old and strong, wearing a smart suit, his eyes are very godlike, and the entire office is very simple. He got up directly to welcome Du Lin's arrival, and then sat on both sides of the desk with Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you don't want to tell me nonsense that doesn't make sense, then we go straight to the subject, you think that after the riots develop into riots, How much economic loss does Ilyan bring?", Du Lin made the mayor frown at the opening, he did not answer Du Lin's question, because the question is not easy to answer, and he is not sure what Du Lin asked. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
