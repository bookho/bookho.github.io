			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not aware of the troubles that he seems to need to spend a lot of money to shut up the sheriff, in front of Mr. It was solved with one sentence, for which Mr. Kemer paid only one cigarette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tinell City Although the current situation is very stable, but this is not absolute, the longer Doolin leaves Tenel City, all kinds of The more and more problems will arise, such as Heidler, who has been hidden behind the scenes. He had left a message to him after Du Lin left, hoping to see him as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably not so good. For a big capitalist like Heidele who relies on the achievements of his ancestors to sell the country, what he does must fit the empire. The official interest, even if this is what he does not want, he must do so. Countless waiting for the "extreme guarte fanatics" who tried him, he made dangerous statements to him from time to time. To protect his life and property, he must hold the thigh of the empire tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well-known Guars’ revenge for “traitors” is very cruel. If it was not for the Guarte dynasty, Heidler had become a high The big man in the society, people lived under the rule of the empire for a long time, maybe he was peeled off and picked up on the pole, and he still mourned for three days and three nights to complete the final judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it’s impossible for Heidler to personally control the fellowship. He must have a “unnamed deputy” to replace him. Controlling the fellowship will be his help, and Du Lin is his most optimistic candidate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to see Du Lin’s purpose. Du Lin can imagine that he is not trying to increase the wealth from the fellowship or Doolin. What he wants is the fellowship itself. When he can hold such a force, he can do something he can't do now, and this power is also the most important part of his plan. It is not impossible to use other people, but you cannot rest assured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is a Guar person, but also has enough self-motivation, self-motivation can be interpreted as "desire" in many times, desire is human spontaneous A power source without any restrictions or requirements. Du Lin likes money, likes power, and hopes to have a higher social status, and all of Heidler can satisfy him. It is no exaggeration to say that with his current status as a man, a few words will allow Doolin to fight for more than a decade or two and become a empire in the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Du Lin is his first choice, he is definitely not the only choice. He not only has to meet Du Lin, but also tries to reach other members of the fellowship. If anyone is willing to bow to reality for "ambition", he does not mind stretching. The hand of friendship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to this there is a problem that needs to be resolved as soon as possible, that is, the Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a problem with the Buddha, not loyal, not physical, but emotional. I don't know which bastard said such a sentence - the exchange of body fluids is the essence and the only thing of love. In short, during the time when the Buddha played Jon, it seemed that Mrs. Vivian had some unhealthy feelings. This is a very terrible thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaotic private life for big men seems not to be a shameful thing, especially for these old parties, almost every big man has a few and a half Open lover. The private lives of the nobility in the once imperialized monarchy were known for their extreme chaos. It is hard to imagine the aristocrats inventing a jaw-dropping absurd game in order to maximize their satisfaction with the spirit and sensory stimuli. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not without boundaries, that is, it cannot produce extra feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the advocacy of the millennial law, people have always believed that the body is "dirty", and the reason for this can be derived from people’s excretion. Things, people are producing these dirty things, so people themselves are dirty. But within this dirty body, there is a holy and pure soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So some ridiculous things in the dirty body are not smashed by mainstream values, but the derailment of the soul is different, the holy soul should be Holy, should not be dirty, should gather all the good things, humility, courtesy, kindness... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a very simple example, when a woman has three or five lovers after she gets married, people will only say that this is a "fengliu" woman. But if she has expired with others after the joy, then she is a slut! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, in the past feudal monarchy and theocracy, all the laws were actually made for the superiors, and compliance and non-compliance are another matter. The main problem with this incident is that Dudu seems to like Mrs. Vivian, and Mrs. Vivian seems to like him too. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very fucking process. Du Lin repeatedly expressed his doubts. How can a woman who has experienced countless winds and waves like Mrs. Vivian's might like a Buddha who is not austin? So Du Lin wondered if Mrs. Vivian had discovered something, or broke through the most basic play, from the material class to the spiritual class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Buddha said that he could feel the true meaning of Mrs. Vivian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people who shouldn’t fall in love have sparked, but the unlucky one is Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor can tolerate his wife’s good relationship with other men all day, but definitely does not allow Mrs. Vivian’s mental derailment, so either Dufo or Du Lin is in trouble. This time their opponent is likely to be the mayor of one of the three masters of the city of Tener, but there is no good news. The good news is that the song has become a past tense, and Wood has returned to the embrace of God. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karur and Ernst on the face of Du Lin’s murder, but the three have partnered to form a trading company and are planning to sneak Expanding the site to the surrounding area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only small gang that can affect Doolin is the half-dead gang, and the establishment of a technical service center with human trafficking to provide guests with distinctive services as the main income." Flame 骷髅 "Tiger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the main one is still the latter one, but the fighting power of the flames is not strong, because it does not need much force and courage to subdue those girls, only need to look good enough Fierce, enough black heart can be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor’s lack of useful manpower allowed Du Lin to have more time to deal with it, but in any case, he must rush back as soon as possible. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After noon family had a lunch together, the reunion is coming, Mr. Kesma is still an impatient appearance, eat I left after dinner. Mrs. Ksma’s eyes were a little red, and he added a lot of meat to Du Lin and Mason, and he was fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doolin and Mason were about to leave the car, Mrs. Ksma took a slap in the chest of the two, and the two men repeatedly retreated. "Remember, you are the children of the Xerma family. Don't admit defeat easily if you encounter any difficulties!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
