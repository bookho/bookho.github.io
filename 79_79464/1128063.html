			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem in the west is a bit serious...", Nomi is reporting to Du Lin on the phone, her words are somewhat alarmist, but this is also fact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of Doolin’s intervention, there is a growing contradiction between migrant workers and imperial local workers, plus the high-profile lawsuits In the drag, there is no final conclusion. From time to time, the two groups of people will have a situation of fighting, and the social security in the west has also deteriorated to some extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state government hopes to resolve the contradictions between the two groups as soon as possible peacefully and friendlyly, and report these issues to the cabinet. They cannot solve it themselves now. Then you can only expect the cabinet to give an effective solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current attention of the cabinet is not in the fart of the West, and the peace talks with the Federation are the focus of attention. As for the West, The western state government should be committed to solving it by itself, and don't always think about letting the cabinet waste energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few days is the last trial. I heard that both sides are in series. I am very worried that if the outcome of the trial is over, if both parties are not satisfied. "Maybe something big!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin patiently listened for a moment and told her not to worry about these problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the problem between migrant workers and local workers is not completely open, causing tremendous destructive power, and the cabinet will not pay attention to these. The problem. Only after some things happened, the cabinet will pay attention to it, and Du Lin will be able to have more room for operation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For immigrants, immigrants are a new ethnic group. They are different from the minority groups such as the Guar, the provincial sage, and the empire is also for them. A strange place is not so friendly. Before both sides had a knife to see the blood, Du Lin went to settle things, and would not bring him any benefits, let alone any positive influence. Only when something happened and it was a big thing, can it be expressed. Doolin's ability to get the necessary good feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hanging up the phone, Du Lin returned to the study, and Magus looked up and he began to look through the documents again, and he did not intend to ask him anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning from the city of Otis, Magus simply said a few words, saying that Du Lin’s overly high-profile donation of his assets to the city hall is not a wise choice, which is likely to produce a series of mistakes. Social judgment. For example, the most mainstream group of conspiracy advocates in public opinion now, they may guess whether Du Lin was subjected to some restraint and persecution, so that he had to donate his assets to the city hall in exchange for his life safety commitment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an impossible thing, and there is a very market. In the minds of conspiracy theorists, the rulers of the country are always mean and despicable villains. Every decision is a move with selfish purposes. For them, the country is always black. Occasionally, a white thing will appear and it will soon be submerged by black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument will make the empire's system extremely passive, although most people have become accustomed to it for so many years, but this is still not a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Du Lin smiled, and the money in my pocket still does not allow me to give you the money in a high-profile way. What is the difference between this and the rogue? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also makes the two people’s words in the past two days less than before, and they all have headaches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the two maintained a certain degree of cold war, the problems facing the west were rapidly fermenting and spreading in two groups at a terrible rate. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These imperial people will not give us a fair treatment, their attitude determines everything, squatting, those few bastards will definitely be let go, but It is the family that we are hurt to be severely punished!", a young man from a small country is propagating his own views, surrounded by a lot of people, some of them even nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was surrounded by so many people and these people recognized his remarks, which kept him in a state of excitement, the arson made the original loose immigrants For the first time, the group was closely united. This may be something that the arsonists did not think about. A small revengeful act of their inadvertentness will bring even more far-reaching influence and unite loose immigrants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, a few immigrants have already had a clear understanding. When this group becomes united, there will inevitably be someone who will stand out from here. Even after a group of animals gather together, there will be the leader, not to mention the more capable and intelligent human beings? As long as you can stand out now, the future may not become a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class division of society is always a small number of people stepping on the heads of most people to enjoy the beautiful scenery. These people may not have much knowledge and do not know how to operate best, but instinct tells them that they must make things bigger. It’s a mess. Things get too big and get more attention. If the imperial government wants to solve these troubles, they will definitely talk to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are so many immigrants, it is impossible to talk to everyone about how to solve these things, then what should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very simple, talk to a few people who can represent more people, and after the problem is solved, determine the influence of these few people, they will become the first Appreciate the upper echelons of the society who stand out from the immigrant community and enjoy more and better treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thought of a brilliant tomorrow is in front of you, young people are becoming more excited, he is waving his arms and talking about his ridiculous partiality theory It has provoked the anger and even hatred of most immigrants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing does not happen only in this place. In many places, the same thing happens in the residence of many migrant workers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July 16, the judge and the jury made a joint decision after the last trial, except for fines and community labor for those who set fire There are no more measures beyond punishment. On the contrary, these immigrants who have been killed by beatings have been relatively severely punished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among these migrant workers, three were the most severely sentenced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to avenge the vengeance slogan to retaliate against these arsonists, because his actions created the state of intellectual ill-conceived participants, which can be said to be His actions to avenge directly caused terrible consequences, so he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is for others to go to the nearby factory to call more immigrants to come back to participate in this fight, because he spontaneously spread the message and put together the original The guy who may not have serious consequences has become a unilateral violent revenge, so this guy was sentenced to six years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is the first person to make the first punch in this unilateral retaliation. If he did not do that at the time, there is a certain The odds may avoid the next fight, so he has to take on more of the responsibilities of others and was sentenced to ten years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the other participants are imprisoned for six to three years. In addition to being in jail, these people will be permanently expelled and will be sent out of the empire when they are in prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial results immediately triggered a great dissatisfaction among the immigrant groups, who believed that the culprit was not the immigrants who acted for their homes. It is those arsonists. Without the arson of their desire to satisfy their lust, it would not be possible to do the following. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immigration is looking for new lawyers to continue to protest against the final results and appeal to the Imperial Supreme Court, and is also contacting more people who can help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a small group of people’s ideas are obviously different, and they intend to resolve the current differences by using other, more radical ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bleeding doesn't necessarily solve the problem, but it can make people see our resolve to solve the problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 19, three days after the final trial, a large-scale conflict broke out in the west. Many immigrants, under the incitement of a few people, struck the workers’ union and fought the entire building. Then the working class also stood up and counterattacked the rioting immigrants. In this two-day incident, which was called the "two-day riot", a total of 61 people were killed and hundreds were injured. Serious consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident has indeed brought the attention of the cabinet back to the country from the negotiations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why didn't anyone realize that these things happened before these tragedies happened?" Magus took a rare table at the cabinet meeting. He has always given people the impression that he is very elegant and easygoing. He can hardly see him lose his temper, which is enough to show how angry he is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dropped a file in his hand to the middle of the table and slammed the bangbang with his finger joints. "Look, gentlemen, ninety. Three people have died, this is the past ten years... No, the most civilized conflicts in the past 20 years, and this is also about the very special group of immigrants.” Only 61 people died in publicity. But in fact, some seriously injured patients went to the hospital not long after they went to see their beliefs. These people were not counted in the first batch of deaths, and they also avoided making things even more alarming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
