			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randomly interjecting at the table is impolite. There is no class in the federation, which has not been seen before, but it is hard to say in the future. Although people's impressions of the nobility still remain in the imperial feudal system, they actually inherit the status and value of the nobility. They are the aristocrats of the federation, but people do not use the word "noble" to describe them. That's it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man has a good tutor and has a high authority in the family, so the girl can only pay more attention to the inexplicable dialogue between the two, guessing what they are Say something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just said that a word was interrupted by the old man, "No Call me, you can call me Sail." This sentence makes the girl's eyes wide open. In fact, only the children who are loved by the elderly in the family can call the old man with a more relative nickname. Everyone else must call him. Respect. This is a very special situation. The girl looks at Du Lin like a ghost. She thinks that Du Lin is not a few years older than her. This should be the first time they meet, and he can get the old man’s favorite. ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still saying that he has something special, maybe he is the illegitimate child of Mr. Sail? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two don’t know that the girl’s brain has begun to become confused. Du Lin hesitated before agreeing to agree with this and continue to Topic, "So... well, Sail. Do you know that there is a most efficient way to dismantle high-rise abandoned buildings?" The old man shook his head and he knew nothing about the building. Du Lin put down the knife and fork and gave An unexpected vocabulary of Mr. Sail, "Blasting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, blast!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "If we use workers to work with large construction machinery to dismantle a high-rise building, we first need to remove it from the upper level. If the high-rise building is directly removed from the bottom, there is a great possibility that it will tilt and even lie. Our workers and construction machinery cause irreparable and unacceptable losses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Removing from a height is relatively safe, they will first dismantle the building Top, then step down on the floor until they recognize When the demolition of this building can be pushed to more than half of the building will not cause any harmful consequences, and they will tear down the rest of the breath "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Du Lin reached out and played with two forks. The smile was a bit strange, as if it was converging. "But the process is very long and requires a complete set of demolition plans, perhaps even the things around this high-rise building." Emptying includes the transfer of a portion of the surrounding residents and the preparation of funds that may be compensated for possible damage to the surrounding environment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long planning cycle, lengthy The dismantling cycle, the obstacles and troubles seen or invisible on the first floor, wasted too much manpower and material resources, just to demolish a building! I think it is possible that the construction party suddenly found this to be very Stupid things, because the times are constantly changing, the long construction cycle will cause many things to produce complex chain effects. For example, some people think that this has destroyed the environment and harmony, the project has stopped, or the follow-up funds are not In place, the construction party’s salary could not be paid, and they gave up the construction.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“At this time, we need to use another one. The way, more efficient, and easier to dismantle the building without leaving any troubles. At the same time, the removal of the leftovers of the building will have great use. Under the continuous progress of the times, we can The world, the choice of this era to decide what to rebuild on this land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail nodded, "I think I understand...", His five-finger fingertips gathered together and then made an expansion-like explosion. "This is what you said blasting?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Mr. Sail , blasting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Sail thought for a while and raised a question, "So how do we ensure that the destructive power of the explosion does not affect other The building, assuming that the building is in downtown, in the city center, once it has collapsed due to the explosion, it is very likely to have a devastating effect on the surrounding buildings. How to avoid this problem?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Du Lin had prepared all the rhetoric before he came, and he repeatedly checked it several times. If he can convince Mr. Sail, this is enough to call it a huge and important turning point. His answer is fast, and Carefully, "there is a word in the blast, called directional blasting. If at the same time destroying the load-bearing system of this building...", Du Lin extended a finger and repeated the sentence, "Attention, it is destroyed at the same time, then this The building will collapse down instead of dumping around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In the end, we only need to clean up the rubbish, we can get a vacant plot in the downtown area in the downtown area. We can let our own decision to build a new building, or just leave him alone. And this is your power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Sail has fallen into meditation again. After a while, he just squeezed a smile and asked, "Do we Can I use other methods to dismantle this building?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and smiled. "I am sorry, Mr. Sail, the bomb has been sent in!" Mr. Sail stunned for a moment, then began to laugh out loud and heard that he was full of enthusiasm. He smiled and shook his head. "I never have." I have seen young people like you, your courage is very big, and your thoughts are very strange. It’s better to come to the federation!”, the old man said, looking at his granddaughter and screaming, “In the empire, you will never be in the first place.” Day, Magus, their 'new nobility' Going up seems to liberate all classes, but in reality the empire is still ruled by the nobility, even..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man suddenly closed his mouth when he said it. I opened the subject. "You come to the Federation and become my granddaughter. As long as you can ensure that the family's longevity, I can include you in the heir's investigation. Do you want to consider it?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not consider this matter at all. He was curious about what Mr. Sail had just finished saying. He faintly felt that Sail’s understanding of the empire far exceeded him. This imperial man. Of course this may be related to Mr. Sail's family, which has always been the top family in the Federation. He has the ability and authority to know something that ordinary people don't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pretended to think about it for a while before he shook his head and said, "If one day I really touched the ceiling, then I will come, hope that by the time, Sail The granddaughter of the husband and wife has not yet married." He also glanced at the girl. The girl kept a smile quietly and sat down on the edge of the table as if she had never been moved since she came to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail does not expect Du Lin to be able to agree at once, he gives a bottom line, "Three years, you have three years to prove whether you are You can do what you want to do. The door to the Rilis family will open for you in three years." The old man smiled. "But after three years, it will all disappear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled a few times and eased the slightly serious atmosphere. He said that the table was full of flavors and flavors. "When you move, Mr. and Ms., we still have a lot of things to solve."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation between them is over now, because it is not suitable for a third person to be present in the depths, and Mr. Sail also needs to talk to other old friends, Du Lin For him, he provided a brand new way of thinking for all the nation-building people, a method that can last forever in his mouth. This method is very dangerous and may hurt yourself, but as Du Lin said, it is not a question of not choosing. The bomb has been sent to the building. What they have to do is to avoid all risks, or Take the risk of removing the bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took the initiative to ask for leave after a meal, he needs to allow enough time for Mr. Sail to consider, to weigh the pros and cons, and finally choose the answer . Of course, Du Lin is not worried. He believes that Mr. Isaiah, or these nationalities, will choose the most correct answer in order to protect their own interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Du Lin left, the girl left the restaurant after obtaining the permission of Mr. Sail. She did not ask why Mr. Sail was so sloppy that she decided her possible future life. It was a stupid question, and it was fortunate to be born in a family like Rileys, but it was also unfortunate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were less than others to fight for decades, but they also lost a lot of freedom and autonomy. In a limited space, they have no choice. that power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the old man left, the girl went to her room and made a phone call. She wanted to find out what Du Lin was doing and what she had done. She does not think that Doolin’s refusal will last for a long time. In the federal state, everyone wants to marry the nation, and Du Lin will definitely return here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She called the phone to one of her friends, she has many friends, and this is one of her luck. From a young age, she is always in contact with Mr. Sail. She is always in the top social environment of the federation. The people she knows are always the big people in the eyes of ordinary people. They may be like them in her own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't reveal any other information on the phone, just asked about the name Doolin and what he did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same person is a young man, just twenty years old, his father is a senior official of the federal government, with a background of the government and the background of the consortium, is the top social A part of the circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
