			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhengsheng Middle School is one of the best private schools in the capital of the state. Many powerful children are sent to school here, of course, like the Royal Academy. It also recruits civilian students with particularly good academic performance and gives generous scholarships so that they do not need to be distracted by things other than learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any school is essentially a business, but this business bears too much social responsibility, enough to let some people ignore the "paying for money" and " The fact that you harvest results is no different from buying money in a store. Since it is a business, education as a commodity, it is natural to show the best goods, that is, these civilian students. They know better that knowledge can indeed change their own destiny, so they study harder and let more potential customers see the school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the school bell rang, the parking lot in the school continued to have the sound of the vehicle, and a luxury car continued to drive out of the campus and disappeared on the road. . Then some walking students came out of the campus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ou Ens saw a student walking down his head. His school uniform was somewhat white, and his boots were not expensive shoes. He immediately leaned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student looked at Ornes with some vigilance, slightly letting some distance, and continuing to bow his head and intend to go around from the side of Ernest, Ornes greeted him very politely. "This classmate, there is something I want to consult with you." Then he took out two ten-dollar denominations, which are for those who have the right to have children. It may be a day's pocket money, but for the children of these civilian families, it is their parents' salary for a week or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student stopped his footsteps immediately, and some glanced at the money in the hands of Ornes, then looked at him, "Mr., what?" Can I help you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the place where the wealthy family children gathered together in Qisheng Middle School, there is nothing at all as a civilian student. Whether it is money or personal experience, it is difficult to meet these children with special talents. Some people may think that knowledge and achievements are their best, this is just a good self-comfort. Even if their grades are so good, they will be able to enter the Royal Academy in the future, and finally come out to work for these students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even a little bit of interest can enter the old and new parties, but also the subordinates of these classmates' fathers, and the most inconspicuous subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many good-performing children are very aware of this, they do not exist in front of students who have a talent that others can’t surpass in their lifetime. Any advantage, naturally, will not be stupid enough to look down on these classmates, and will not look down on money and power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of twenty dollars in the hands of Ernest, the classmate decided to serve the twenty dollars for the first time, as long as he did not trample on him. dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know Richard?" Ornes pointed to the tea restaurant not far away. "Let's go over there."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked toward the outside, the student said: "I know him, no one knows who is winning, he is our prince, because his father is Mr. Governor." When the students said these words, they had a sigh of relief in their eyes. Richard had poor academic performance and poor sports performance, but he was always the most popular person. The most powerful group of people in the school are surrounded by him, and the beautiful girls are always willing to lie in bed to make him cheap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because his father is the governor, this is very unfair, but very fair, because the word fairness has not been the bottom of the empire since its birth. service. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ornes smiled. He could see that this student didn’t like Richard. This is what he hoped. They crossed the road and walked into the tea. In the restaurant, O'Neill asked for a remote place, ordered a few points of the recommended dishes here, and continued the topic. "I know that the next words may make you vigilant and misunderstood, so I need to explain in advance. I am not a bad person, I just want to impress his father through Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, in your knowledge, I and 'the people' There is no difference, but I am more sincere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student nodded, and his temptation by twenty pieces does not mean that he is a fool, if the man in front of him It’s a bad guy like a kidnapper. If they kidnap Richard and they’re caught, they might be able to trace themselves. He can't tell the truth, even if Ornes says so now, he won't say all the truth, he needs to protect himself, and his family needs him to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ornes pushed 20 pieces directly on the table and pushed it forward. "Next, every question has a return of ten dollars!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He When trying to get close to Richard, a group of people are looking for him and his master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a photo of Soro and Ornes. I hope that you can remember the appearance of these two people as soon as possible. To be honest, I have violated the rules. In a coffee shop opposite the Imperial Bank, a bank staff placed two photos on the table, surrounded by a group of young people with caps, windbreakers and plaid white shirts. These people showed a very special atmosphere, which made him somewhat disgusted and somewhat scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people may all be gangs, and he can also guess the purpose of these people to see photos, just to find someone called Soro and Ornes. . The reason why he did this was because someone called to tell him that if he didn't do this, he would reveal the scandal that he should take the loan from the Imperial Bank. This will not only make him lose his name, but also allow him to eat a prisoner's meal in prison for a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a few steps back and forth, urging him to come up, "Oh, no, time is coming, I can't leave for so long!!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A guy with a domed felt hat and a dark windbreaker who was overweight and smiled and walked over and took his hand. "My children have not Remember the looks of the two guys, and bother you to wait a little longer!", said the guy shook his hand hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just wanted to break free, he felt that he was not very comfortable with some things in his palm. He knows what it is. He deals with these things every day. How could he not know? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s money, a roll of money, at least one or two hundred. His expression suddenly eased, and in addition to the money of the palm of his hand, he also saw the threatening eyes from the eyes of this fat man. He was stiff for two or three seconds, and his face suddenly smiled. "Well, no way, who makes us friends?", he also shook his wrist hard, and the fat man released his hand, he will The money in his hand was put in his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we are friends!", the fat man glared at his shoulder and smiled loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man walked past the table and waited for a dozen seconds to firmly engrave the characteristics of the two men in his mind and then let go of the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process lasted for more than half an hour. When all the young people left, the fat man slapped the palm of the bank staff’s chest. Said: "Today's coffee is good, we will contact you again in the next day!", said that he waved his hand, sorted out the collar and left the coffee shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bank’s staff sighed. He took back the two photos on the table, quickly returned to the bank, and found out the temporary signature authorization. File, repost the photos of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I won’t be in trouble for him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty young people quickly spread to every corner of the city, they relayed the characteristics of Soro and Ornes to their friends, the street Friends and some people who sell intelligence, then stare at those high-end places. Doolin told them by phone that the other party must be here, and will definitely enter the high-end places, be sure to find them, and then stare at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, after talking for forty minutes, Ornes paid two hundred pieces and he politely sent the student to leave, the money spent It's worth it, at least he thinks so. The governor's eldest son Richard has a hobby, like many young people, he likes to fool. Those entertainment places are crazy to attract the family's extraordinary young master, and the more vulgar the place, the more he likes to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the confession of the classmate, Richard may be in a bar called "Little Wildcat" in the evening. He often goes to that place, where is the regular customer. . And he will bring some people to go, it is said that they will become crazy there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is good news. Ornes contacted the people who sold the Gnoum mushroom here through the family relationship. He spent two hundred pieces and bought ten copies. In the pocket, then called a taxi, said the name of the Little Wildcat Club, insisted on the driver’s strange eyes and strange atmosphere for twenty minutes, lost a ten-dollar bill and did not want to go back to zero. , left the taxi directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood on a remote street some distance from "Light", watching the neon lights twitching with a lot of broken lamps, and some drums in his heart. The feeling here is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
