			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I went to school to have a history lesson. I remember that the provincial sages were good at taming, and they became their partners after domesticating them. Whenever the war broke out, they would drive their partners to rush to the enemy and tear the enemy into pieces. Before the discovery of the twins, the method of the provincial sage did have some miraculous effects, especially their lions. Legion. It is said that when the war began, hundreds of lions rushed to each other's camp from all directions, and they did not touch each other. The enemy cavalry was completely finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "These horses saw so many lions, not to mention the charge, and even the station was unstable. Later, while the other side was not defeated by the Lions in the war for the cavalry, they put on the blinds." In front of the horse's nose, there is a nose mask coated with mint juice. This way the horse can't see the lion and can't smell the predator, and will not be afraid of these lions."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Later, the provincial sage Changed the tactics, they will use the needle to stab the lion before the line, so the roar of the lion can make the cavalry's horses stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the grown up said something that had nothing to do with the Doolin question, it also caused Doolin’s curiosity. When he said it, he would stop talking about it. Du Lin asked, then? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then?", the mayor laughed. "Then these lions in turn killed their masters alive, and the provincial sages had to domesticate them." All kinds of fierce beasts have been killed, and since then the lions have been destroyed, and the lions have never been rebuilt until the demise of the provincial dynasty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Capital Power is like this lion. When the empire needs them to rush to the enemy at the forefront of the war, it will loosen all the shackles. If one day, the empire finds that the capital is trying to turn its back and bite itself, it is The moment the empire was packing up the capital." He smiled and sighed with relief. If he pointed out to Du Lin, "Dulin, I don't deny that many people underestimate the power of capital, but how is this power?" More than people's imagination, it can't compare with the millions of soldiers who have experienced war baptism."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think about it, think about it and give it to you. I called!", the mayor put a business card on the bench, he took it. Turin's shoulder, smiled and got up to leave, leaving only a Turin man sitting on a bench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glanced at the business card next to him, Du Lin glanced at it, a name, a phone call, and the aristocratic lines. It seems that the mayor is not a simple character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he neglected that the devil looked weak and pitiful when he was in the cage, but after releasing it, he was drinking the desire of people for sin, it It is not the weak one. If the power of capital can be controlled, then this empire will not be like this. Whether it is the New Party or the old party, it is too underestimated the greed of the fruit and fruit represented by businessmen and businessmen. It is too overestimated. I have overestimated my control over the empire and society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, from the words of the mayor, it seems that the empire has a way to stop the galloping train, but how much does it cost? It may affect the foundation of the entire empire. At that time, I am afraid that all this will be reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn’t that the world in Doolin’s dreams like this? The guy who called Washington or something thought he could suppress all the merchants, but in the end he had to bow to the businessman. The same is true in this world. It is the management of the empire that has not recognized the harm and seriousness of capital, so the rate of capital expansion is far beyond people's expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Imperial Central Bank, to the Imperial Chamber of Commerce, these merchants have quietly held the economic lifeline of the entire empire. Once they find out that there is no wind and no movement, there is no doubt that there will always be some people who are willing to surrender to the more "probable" side. On which day, perhaps the empire is really going to make a big deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin collected the business card, he was considering the advice of the mayor, whether to join another game. After a short period of thinking, Du Lin’s brows that were tightly screwed together gradually spread. In fact, at this time, he refused the good intentions of the mayor, and at most he did not exceed five years. He still had to join the game. . Once his fellow countrymen grow up, they will inevitably move closer to the other extreme - the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The township association established a party, and his president naturally became the party leader and leader. At that time, he was forced to stand up and stand on the opposite side of the New Party, the Old Party, and the Kadima Party, facing more problems and enemies. However, at this time, I will actively join the new party. When the time comes, I may be able to pull a group of people out of the new party and join the fellowship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin inexplicably remembered the one that the big man in the dream often said - this game is not small! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licked his mouth, stood up and shook his clothes, put the hat back on, put his hands in his waist pockets, and walked slowly toward the manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs to make arrangements for the next step before he can accept the invitation of the mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the new batch of goods came out of the sea, Du Lin called the guys who had been following him to the study. This is the first time Doolin Formally invite them, which makes them a little nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Easy, I am not going to kill you!", Doolin opened the box on the table and pointed to the tens of dollars in it. On the good land, "take it yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of him sitting in a chair, he slowly said it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rules have been established, and the rest is to supervise see them, I can't pay attention to this, you need Carter to pay attention to you. Let the clubs around Staring at these people, I don't ask them to make a mistake like a saint, but the mistakes of the cross line must not appear." The card features a nod, saying that I know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at Savi again. The 14-year-old Savi grew a lot and looked at the one-six-six look. The clothes made are like a premature mature appearance. He recently imitated Du Lin, he transferred the worship of the Buddha to Du Lin, so how Du Lin usually shows how he will behave. For Du Lin, this is a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next step is that we need stricter regulations, a more rational structure, and a more complete system. Savi, the stormtroopers that have been taught to you in the battle." Du Lin got up and took a cigarette from the cigarette case and threw it. "From today, you are the fourth leader."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Savi surprised to catch the cigarette and stared at the Buddha. Dudu turned a blind eye and took out a lighter from his pocket for Savvy. He took a sip of his breath and slowly spit out the smoke that had turned around in his lungs. It’s not the first time to look at his smoking, but neither Du Lin nor Buddha said anything. Savy always wants to grow up. He always has to take up important positions and ask him not to smoke or drink, to do nothing, is it possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you boss, I will do it well!", Savi’s smile looks like he was so happy that he took the most pocket money from his life in the hands of Dufu two years ago. He will remember it for a lifetime, that time. The Buddha gave him two very strong coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. "I will give you a hundred places. Try to choose the children on the side of Tyner. Don't be too old, can't exceed At the age of fourteen, I will set aside 30 places for other places. After the number of people has been assembled, I will arrange for you to go to the navy for training, half a year. If someone can’t stand it, don’t stop, then make up. I only have one request, I must be strong, I must obey the order!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Du Lin looked at Jose, "in our group of people You are the most stable and the most reassuring." Du Lin seems to have forgotten the last time Jose had something wrong. "From today on, the intelligence work you take over, on our site, Pulling up the intelligence network, I won't give you any hard indicators, you just have to work hard to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jose also nodded, thinking The face did not stretch at the end, revealing a silly smile. In the end, it is the "big child" of the 17th and 9th. Suddenly, Du Lin was appointed with great power. With his current experience, he could not do the color of emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin then licked his head and looked at Ellis sitting on the back of the sofa. Although Ellis is not very smart, he is not the best to kill, but he is responsible and very responsible. The things that are given to him, even if he knows that he can't do it, will force him to complete. Du Lin thought for a moment and said: "Irian is our old nest here. We must guarantee the safety here. The usual work and tasks are handed over to you. Can you do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice looked awkward and licked his lips a little nervously. He tapped his head and didn't speak. This is enough, and Du Lin responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally looked at the Buddha and looked at the bastard with a playful taste. "To be honest, you are the laziest among us, lacking in doing things." Initiative, I don't say you don't do it, I push you to take a step. I am a bit worried, I may not be on the Irian side for a while, if you leave you alone, maybe you are all day In addition to sleeping and sleeping, you should follow me, at least where I can see you, you have no chance to steal that lazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
