			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president who should have had a clear name but has not yet reached the final decision to go it alone, he considered it for a long time to make such a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help others, it’s better to be your own boss. In this age of turbulence, there are opportunities everywhere. The empire’s all-embracing empire dream seems to be in every one. Human hand. Every inspirational collision seems to herald the success of the future. More and more crazy people have begun to try to put the first brick code of their own business empire on the ground. Don’t try it, maybe it will be regrettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since workers’ unions can grow bigger, why can’t they grow bigger? Moreover, he now holds the information and labor resources of most of the workers in the western part of the country. Even if he is facing the workers' union, he will not lose. The biggest advantage of the workers' union is that they have the specific information of most workers, and they have a closer relationship with the workers. These are not problems. Even if he only has Du Lin, the biggest employer, he has the advantage of not losing even if he loses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the case, then go it alone. For this idea of ​​President Jason, Du Lin is supportive, and the integration and utilization of resources is simple, but it is actually very troublesome to do. The trouble is that the heavy work can not be done in a short time, and Du Lin has to stand on the opposite side of the workers' union. There is no reason for Du Lin to smash the workers' union. The workers' union still smiles and says to Du Lin. It doesn't matter if you are addicted to it. I have a forty-meter machete here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not afraid of the workers’ union, and has already smashed the other side a few knives, but there is no benefit to harm the interests of others, nor Du Lin’s style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If President Jason is willing to join his camp, Du Lin is also welcome. He is not willing to join, and there is no place to be angry or annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which option is good or bad, and in Dulin’s heart, he is more inclined to be Jason’s own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The working class is a very special class. They are very pristine and very hard-working. Even if they face the exploitation of capitalists, they can withstand them as long as they can survive. But at the same time, the working class is a very sensitive and vulnerable special group. A little bit of something that can shake their sensitive nerves will instantly make the calm lakes start a huge wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, at this time, the parade outside the city hall, Julio could not find a way to make the Western citizens recognize it. He also asked for an investigation into how the doormen’s policy of promoting the three guarantees was passed in the state legislature during his tenure, and A request was made to the Cabinet to review and evaluate the three-guarantee policy and initiate a duty crime investigation. There is nothing wrong with this move in the official and capital camps. This is a very common way of shirking responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troubles left by the predecessor do not need to be carried on their own, in order to avoid some people from forcibly imposing guilt on their shoulders, simply tearing the face directly to the table . Anyway, the doorman was dead, and the Kadima party was finished. Faced with the old and weak, the other side of the table, Julio did not hesitate to flip the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overturned table will hurt people. The first to be hurt is the working class in the west. Once the state legislature and cabinet have investigated, the policy of three guarantees is illegal. The policy adopted by the means, then this means that the three-guarantee policy that has been implemented for several years in the west will come to a close, and those who participate in the three-guarantee policy will forever lose their original welfare protection, including the insurance premium paid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public opinion that has been very turbulent has completely boiled up at this moment. From this news, I don’t know who was announced, and now it’s only three days, the whole time. In the west, there have been signs of big things happening. The three state governments are paying close attention and discussing how to solve them. Julio has also become a headache - the big strike is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last move of President Jason before he completely separated from the workers’ union. He contacted a large number of working classes and called for the working class in the west to unite. Getting up and fighting the “persecution” and “exploitation” from the official in a legal and reasonable way is obviously a way of expressing the relative reason and being able to fully express your own demands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can’t solve this big strike, the west may have a long period of confrontation, which has nothing to do with money and the three guarantees policy, but the official The issue of credibility - in fact, is still related to interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Julio feel the claws is that this big strike does not only happen in the city of Villi, but in the 22 cities of the entire west. When it broke out, all the working class or other classes involved in the three-guarantee policy would respond to the general strike. This means that industrial production in the western region will be shut down, and more than three million workers will put down their work, meaning that countless banknotes in the hands of capitalists will evaporate into water vapor, which will disappear when the wind blows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
