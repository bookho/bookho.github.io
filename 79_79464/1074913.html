			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cable TV is currently only established in three cities, a city in the south, Irian must have it, and the rest is the center of the political economy and culture of the capital. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also wants to spread the TV station all over the Empire at once, but the problem is that those signal lines don’t look worthwhile, but if you follow the scale of a city Laying, and having to reserve enough interfaces, this is an astronomical number, even if he is not enough in his hands now, it is not enough to turn ten times. He can only choose to pre-install three cities before considering Get money first through commercial operations, and then use the money to lay routes for other cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he discussed the charging issue with Nasha and Freina, including the management in the new company. Du Lin’s idea was six Nineteen points were all included, but they were unanimously opposed by others. Nasha thinks that the sixty-nine-seven points of the monthly rent may be appropriate, but if it is all channels, it is obviously a disadvantage. Especially when this business is still unique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high profits brought by the monopoly are enough to support them to quickly lay a sound, horrific national-level signal transmission network connecting all cities across the country, speeding up this The infrastructure will be more helpful for their later earnings, at least the profit period will come early, and the profit margin will expand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin felt that the charge was too embarrassing, and he put the words out, and finally, with the help of the business elite, they opened a conference call. A standard for charging has been established. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words that Du Lin said at the press conference are still valid, but there is a premise here that users who must subscribe to the full channel and have two years at a time, You can apply for a full-channel "old user" welfare policy with six ninety-nine points after two years. Prior to this, the opening fee for each channel was three ninety-nine points, and the opening of the entire channel required thirty-nine ninety-nine. In addition, Nasha and Freina and the Producers Association have negotiated another cooperation project, a very important cooperation plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all users who have access to cable TV signals can order any existing movies in the home, just pay an extra fee for this. And the movie will be played on Channel 11 alone. Of course, there are still a lot of technical problems that have not been solved. For example, how to make users and TV stations generate simple and effective contacts, and quickly collect a series of problems such as movies that they like to watch, all need to be further solved by Science Island. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, the Producers Association and Du Lin's cable TV broadcasting company signed a commercial agreement, the Producers Association provides at least three million, no more than 10 million special research funds for on-demand technology, and enjoy The technology has 33% of the patent. This is a very good business plan, using other people's money to do research for yourself, and does not need to pay all the patent rights, it is definitely a big profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the producers’ association, they did not lose money in this way. According to the current standards and rules of the film industry, once a film is released, the cinema If the film continues to be played in the future, 99% of the revenue will be owned by the cinema, and only one percent of the symbol will be handed over to the producer. This has made many producers very painful. Under this system, there has always been a legal stealing of the box office. Those theaters have taken the film but they don’t play it, or play it less, and wait until the end of the screening period to start mass playback. The production company has caused great losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The production company has also sued these theaters, and the results are very unsatisfactory. First, the way to get these sources from the cinema is not free, but If you pay for it yourself, then the ownership and all rights of the copy of the film belong to the cinema line. When they love to play it, the production company has no right to ask the cinema line to perform the obligations they do not need to bear. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also caused the filmmaker to either provide a free copy of the movie and sign a protocol detailing the time period of each day when the movie is released. Or, if you spend another sum of money to hire a time period to arrange the playback, in short, the producers become very weak on the cinema issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if Doolin’s bastard can get those viewers to watch movies at home and have an accurate billing method, some studios think The abandonment of most rogue cinemas is not a problem, even if the two women ask for a fee of 45 percent from the cost of each on-demand movie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this has a more obvious benefit, that is, when the "replay" is the same as the production company, even if those viewers order it more than a decade ago. Movies, they can profit from it. There is no embarrassing situation where only one percent of the box office’s income is released after the release period. Sometimes even one percent does not. Those theaters will not tell the production company. Stepping on the horse began to play the movie you made a few years ago to make money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in order to break the constraints of the cinema on the producer side, they first extracted 3 million for special research. Once the research is successful, they will Will let those theaters know what is called a failure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is moving in the best direction of the Doolin plan, but the problem still arises. The first place to appear is the Imperial Capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the wires that need to be pulled by the utility pole, there is only a telephone line left, and it does not occupy too much space. Wires can be separated by a main line. The number of telephone lines is not so much because many ordinary households do not have the right to use the telephone. They cannot afford to pay for the telephone. But the signal line of cable TV is a bit more, and it is an amazing project to split it into every corner of the city after it comes out of the TV station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not realistic to hang on the pole. I’m afraid that the two poles are not necessarily able to withstand the TV signal line from the TV station, so hit one. The plan to start is to bury the telephone line under the ground. But just beginning to dig, the people of the Social Service Bureau of the Imperial Capital appeared. They asked the project to stop, and the other two cities were the same. There were various reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor is here to say that the emperor is a historical city with a history of more than a thousand years, and it has been the capital of the empire for hundreds of years. The meaning and historical value of each brick on the ground is called historical relics. Such destructive construction is absolutely not allowed, and it will damage too many historical traces and ground, so the cable TV project is not allowed to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irian’s aspect is said to take into account the urban appearance. As a tourist city, if there are flying dust and construction sites everywhere, the image of Irian will be very Great destruction. How to dig, when to dig, each time you have to dig a lot, you must first submit a reasonable plan to the City Hall, and only after approval is allowed to break ground. In particular, people in the city hall said that it is best to put the construction period in the winter break period. At that time, the tourists of Irian will be reduced sharply, which is more suitable for such large construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the problems in the southern cities, Du Lin felt that he wanted money there. The reasons they put forward were very stubborn. Of course, they also corresponded to the actual situation and what roads were destroyed. Dust, noise pollution, and a lot of messy reports from residents. Although the problems are many, but their determination is not firm enough, it seems that there is still the possibility of talking. If you can talk, it is to ask for money. In the south where everything can be used as a commodity, this is the best and simplest thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the South, the construction of the Irian and the Emperor are a trouble, so that Du Lin’s head hurts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just Du Lin who has a headache, but there are others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Taylor sat on the board meeting at the meeting, he was not qualified to sit in the position of the card name card, only against the wall Listen to the corner of the earliest meeting room. He looked very bad all over the place. He fell from the spiral staircase of Kailemen and broke his leg and arm. Now he is plastered and fixed and can't move. He also wore gauze on his head and a cervical vertebra protector on his neck, feeling like he had just escaped from the arms of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting is now discussing the issue of a comprehensive suspension of the insurance business. Du Lin not only came up with a patent certificate, but also brought the two major banks to the empire. The Supreme Court, and only the Supreme Court of the Empire, is qualified to hear cases concerning the two major banks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was accused of this kind of thing. The imperial central bank experienced not knowing how many times. I dare not say that every time I win, but 99% of the time. It was they who finally won the lawsuit. There is no other name, it is rich. The money can drag down all the people who sued them, dragging the lawsuit into a long trial process, and finally the plaintiff finally chooses to withdraw the lawsuit because of bankruptcy or unable to bear huge economic pressure. The symbolic compensation for the imperial central bank is over. Sometimes even a penny will not be given to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a saying in the folks, "If there is no money, the most sensible way is to not challenge the bank", according to the current judicial practitioners - those who are called lawyers The way vampires work, they can get a considerable portion of their income regardless of winning or losing a lawsuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winning, the amount of compensation involved in the indictment is paid to the lawyer as a percentage of the additional percentage, usually at 12% to 100% Between the twenty, sometimes it will be even higher, even 50% of the cases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you lose, you also need to pay such a fee, of course, the fee is between one and three percent of the compensation, except The cost of hiring a lawyer must be paid regardless of whether you win or lose. The collection of evidence requires fees, the cost of collating the materials, the cost of developing a defense plan, and the cost of defending the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless expenses added together, and the bank may not pay enough for the lawyer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if the plaintiffs have money and can drag them down with the lawsuit, such as people like Doolin, they have no good idea. When the risk is too high, the timely stop loss is the bank's code of conduct. If you can win, you will fight. It looks like you can't win if you don't win. After all, the bank has to pay for the lawsuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawsuits they discussed today are different from the previous ones, because Du Lin has money and is very rich! Every month, huge sums of money from the cities of Irian and Otis flow into dozens of unregistered accounts, and the bank initially assessed Dulin’s worth, between 200 million and 300 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not his cash, it’s an assessment that includes all the combination of movable and immovable property, and kicks out the part of the illegal gain, which part is not able to Calculated on the book. The biggest asset comes from the real estate in Otis. Duolin originally took the land of six districts in Otis with a cheap price of 100,000 yuan, almost all the bustling areas of the city. The prices of these plots are rapidly increasing, and with the development of the city of Otis and the ability to absorb gold, it will take a long time for these plots to be worth five hundred million or one billion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not an interesting thing to have a lawsuit with such a guy. You can’t find the feeling of being abused. You can only feel abused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think we need to fight such a lawsuit with him?", the three executive directors attended the meeting, including four other directors There are still a few who are unable to come because of various reasons, but they have sent representatives. The board of directors was almost all in place, and Taylor also saw a relaxed face of Felice sitting at the end and whispering to another director. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s eyes are on the ministers of the Imperial Bank’s Legal Department and on the board of directors. He nodded and said, "We must fight such a lawsuit with Du Lin, and at the same time sued Du Lin for violating the Anti-Monopoly Law and the Anti-Industry Manipulation Act. In addition, we need to sue the Imperial Patent Office. Investigating the Patent Office and the Du Linquan money transaction, registering a category that has never been registered as a patent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man pouted and thought, "We need What to do, what can we get, what do we lose?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two people’s voices in the entire conference room, and everyone else closes their mouths tightly. In addition to sitting in the last Phillips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
