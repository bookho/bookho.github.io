			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two years or so, the Anti-Organizational Crime Investigation Bureau has been trying to investigate Du Lin but has not been authorized because Dulin’s identity was very special at the time. Not only the mayor of the city of Otis, but also the mayor of the first special administrative city of the empire. Any investigation of Doolin must be approved by the cabinet. At that time, considering the sensitive identity of Doolin, the cabinet rejected the application of the Anti-Organization Crime Investigation Bureau, but now there is not much trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is no longer the mayor, and his investigation will not trigger the nerves of some of the neuro-sensitive members of the New Party, and will not let them feel that they are immediately To be persecuted. In addition, the Cabinet approved the Security Committee and the Military Intelligence Unit to investigate and collect the evidence of Du Lin’s crime. The application of the Anti-Organization Crime Investigation Bureau was approved on the same day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than a year ago, the Organized Crimes Investigation Bureau resolved another large-scale organized crime force, at the time of the internal review meeting - Yes, it is not a celebration meeting. It took nearly two years to erase a criminal organization from the empire. The Secretary thinks this is absolutely a shame, not something to be happy about. The empire gave them the best equipment, the most authority, the most powerful support, and paid them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, two years ago, I found enough evidence to smash the organization, invested millions of dollars, and tens of thousands of field missions. It’s not a shame that such an organization is going to kill dozens of detectives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the review meeting, the director summed up the mistakes that have occurred during the investigation process, and finally talked about the problems of the association, which he said at the time. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fellowship is a special organization that is very different from ordinary gang organizations. This is a force between gang organizations and religious beliefs. They have Clear loyalty goals, with a clear hierarchy, are extremely powerful and aggressive. But this organization has not shown great destructive power in society, and this is precisely the most terrible place in the fellowship... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the director gave the fellowship a very "high" evaluation, and simply sorted out the structure of the fellowship, from Du Lin, the "Messiah" "Everyone, go to the club president below, then the captain, and finally the ordinary members. It seems that there is no difference between the structure and the ordinary organization. In fact, the fellow country has one of the biggest and most significant features, that is, it is not easy to be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While detecting another organized criminal force, they arrested one of the leaders of a branch gang and successfully sued the prisoner. The branch gang was chaotic in a flash, and some captains began to fight internally to compete for the gang leader. The position, some captains directly searched for a fortune to escape with their own hearts, and two captains directly surrendered, providing more questions. This is what a normal gang should look like, and it will enter the split stage after losing the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fellowships are different. They also tried to arrest the branch president of a fellow village branch. As a result, there was nothing. What kind of people usually look like, what the club president looks like after being arrested, even on the second day after the club president was arrested, a new branch president appeared. What makes people feel unacceptable is that members actually obey the command of the new president. The club president who was caught by them was released on bail without sufficient evidence, and of course they deliberately let him leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is that there will be two club presidents in a club, and they will definitely fall into the fight because of power. As long as one party is obviously at a disadvantage, it is a good time to commit an organized crime investigation bureau. They can turn the sub-president who is inferior into a tainted witness and give him a certain pardon to let him testify against the criminal activities of the association. In the cognition of the Organized Crime Investigation Bureau, the losers in the gang, especially the losers at the leader level, are usually very miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they didn’t think was that the two club presidents were safe and sound, and the one who was arrested was directly transferred to a new agent, even to the fellow’s The power has expanded a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can’t catch Doolin and let him be sanctioned by law, there’s no more meaning for the following club leaders, and in turn the agents of the Bureau of Investigation It is also possible that the sacrifice is hurt, so the action against the fellowship has been stagnant. Now, everyone is collecting evidence of their crimes. When there is sufficient evidence to try Du Lin, the evidence is enough for the fellow villagers to become a past in one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only thing they can do at this stage! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who is on the list nodded. "Yes, it’s Alfonso. I have seen his photos. The Somalia area has just set up a new one. The fellow country association, who was originally an agent of the next city, is now the branch president of the Somalia branch. This man is very dark, and I heard from colleagues that he may be involved in no less than seventeen fires and murders." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The photographer who took the photo sighed. He had taken several photos in succession, and sometimes the agents also had such sighs and helplessness. Obviously these people are criminals, but they have no way to do it. What makes them feel discouraged is that these people simply do not care about being tracked and investigated. They still maintain a certain degree of high-profile, often appear in a variety of occasions, providing a variety of valuable information to the Bureau of Investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look, it’s all Buddha...", the person who is recording the list raised his chin, and the partner around him raised the camera and it was a slap in the face. In the camera, Alfonso and the Buddha embraced each other, and then they entered the house together and saw that Alfonso was very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What level is it now?", the photographer taking the camera repeatedly put the camera down, he asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the huge organization of the Association, Du Lin is the first person without a doubt, and the next step is, for example, the Buddha’s early rise in Doolin’s rise. Old ministers, although they do not have the title of any club president or agent, but their status is much higher than the average club president. To a certain extent, they can even be seen as the embodiment of Doolin's will! Even Alfonso, the fierce branch of the Somalia region, saw that all Buddhas had a little care and respect, so that everyone did not know how to arrange for the Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The record-recording agent snorted, "The Analysis Section believes that a new class should be added to the ranks of Doolin and the club president, but there has never been Be sure, because this class does not seem to join new members, it is more inclined to position them as independent independent characters like the big housekeeper of the association.", a distant luxury The car, the two immediately closed their mouths and began to shoot crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrival of every luxury car means that a big man in a certain city has appeared. So far, the fellowship has spread all over the Empire. The city has agents in one hundred cities to sell Doolin and other people's private liquor. The number of members of the entire fellowship has reached 110,000. But the real number is far more than the statistics. The reason is very simple. Only one person in a family can join the township and become a formal member. But if you count the other members of the family, this number may have to be turned over. Times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the decision that Du Lin made after the establishment of the fellowship. During the start of the year, there was a lot of fighting and many companions died. This made Du Lin aware that if all the young people in a family joined the fellowship, they would die if they performed an action together, and a family would have no future and everything would be finished. This is unfair and unfair, so there is another system that does not allow the only child in the Guar family who is the only daughter to join the fellowship. This is the bottom line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
