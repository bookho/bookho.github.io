			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The more complete the action, the more perfect the plan will be, and it will take some time for detection and investigation!" Two days, the most famous prosecutor and his assistant from Orodo have appeared in the police station. The prosecutor named Amp is employed by the Imperial Central Bank headquarters and he will become the first group leader of the task force. Participated in the investigation of the Golden Robbery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp’s resume is dazzling and dazzling to the extent that it can pierce the human eye. He graduated from the Imperial Army Military Academy with excellent results. It seems that after graduation, he already has the rank of captain. If he does not think that joining the army is a waste of talent for him, he may have become the future star of the Army. After graduating, he first worked for two years as a gendarme, smashed some holes, and solved a group of traitors who used to sell military money. Then, after being transferred to the police system through social relations, and after more than a dozen old cases with influential and sensational effects, he was promoted to become a prosecutor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the prosecutor’s position is close to ten years, during which more than 600 people were sent to prison, and some of them were extremely The special case was personally uncovered by him. There are rumors that the capital is hoping that Amp can hand over the local work as soon as possible and report to the capital, but he still stayed in Orodo on the grounds that a serial murder case has not been broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not lying or looking for reasons for himself. He has a certain degree of obsessive-compulsive disorder, so he can't leave his current position as long as he has a case in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he came to the city of Tener, the purpose is to relax a little while competing with the serial killer. He regarded the crime as a pursuit of life, but also broke the simple case, a kind of relaxation and adjustment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He read all the known information and information about the Golden Robbery on the steam locomotive that came here. After a night of finishing, he appeared in this conference room. in. The mayor was accompanied by him and supported him. This is also the request of the Imperial Central Bank. Peter is required to create an unimpeded high-speed and efficient case-breaking environment for Amp, so Amp is here, the mayor is sitting behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp’s assistant sent some of the information he had rearranged to the hands of each investigator, “from the planning and execution of the bank robbery To a certain extent, there are countless cases in Cannes. The whimsical method and strong execution instructions are not too big for this group of people. Only young people will have so many ideas. Older robbers. Their plans are often very simple, and it is their understanding of the bank robbery with their guns."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I noticed that there were several interactions between the witnesses who had died and the strollers in the testimony of the witnesses on the scene. I saw your point of view. I don't deny that it is possible that this robber is a local, in you. On this idea, I have expanded some new ideas. Guards and... We call it the robbers A, then is it possible that they are not knowing, just met? I think there is a big chance that this is the case. For example, when the other party stepped on the point, both sides met face to face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Along this line of thought, I asked my assistant to collect other bank staff within a week. Work situation, and whether they found some embarrassing situations and customers during their work, among them...", Anpyang raised the documents in his hands, "The shift manager said that three days ago, a customer and the guard had interacted, then Going to the toilet. Is it possible that the customer who interacted with the guard is our robber A? His purpose at the time might not be to ask for directions, but to observe?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Continue with this idea, I once again collected the testimony of the staff, including the shift manager who directed the client to the bank's receptionist, a girl named Alisa. But Now that the girl is missing, we can't find her. What makes me even more surprised is that you don't pay much attention to this very important news. If I were you, I would immediately look for the whereabouts of Alisa. Whether she is a participant in this robbery or an insider, her presence will play a very positive role in solving the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I have to admit that the city of Ternell is very remote, and your business ability is very backward. Even if there is no police dog, even the most basic search is incomplete. In the middle of the night, someone went to the police station to report the case and said that it was living. A group of cockroaches in the sewers were shot in the sewers, didn’t they?” He looked at Prando with his god's eyes, and Prando knew a fart and could only subconsciously point his head. General He pointed to him and continued: "Who can tell why there is no search for the sewage system and sewer of the bank without finding a robber on the scene?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prang When I just wanted to say something, Amp raised his hand and stopped him. "If I were you, I would arrange someone to look for the girl named Alisa, instead of sitting here and preparing to explain to me that the sewage pipeline is not accessible! The suppression measures for sewage pipelines are for illegal invaders who want to enter the sewage pipeline from the sewer line. They are not aimed at those robbers who have already completed the looting. As long as they close the power cabin, they can evacuate directly from the sewage pipeline. I think This is why there is a death in the sewer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They didn't die from vying for the site and food. They found the robbers and then they were wiped out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a premeditated, well-planned plan. Robbery, so your eyes can't just focus on the recent time period, and you have to put it in the longer term. All the suspected people, in addition to finding out what they are doing recently, must also find out whether they have five to ten years. Unusual work changes, or special social activities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp picked up a cup of coffee and took a bite of bitter coffee to moisturize the scorpion. “I think it’s very likely that these robbers are still hidden around the city, even hidden in the city. They did not take the spare crystals in the garage when they drove in the escort, indicating that they There is already a clear destination, and there is no need to carry spare twins to get there. The robbers evacuated from the sewer, although they are smart enough to integrate themselves into the city, do not know that they also exposed the information, they have no plans Leave here "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I dare not say that my inference is correct, I just judge from the already existing clues to the truth as much as possible, the next The main work will be done by you. If you can't do it now, I will apply for the police at the State Police Investigation Bureau to cooperate with my investigation work. But if you think you can do it, please do your best. Go to finish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next, I have to arrange several tasks, and I must complete the collection of information as soon as possible. First, the steam engine station and the dock are arranged to be on duty. Before the case is solved, it is forbidden for any truck to leave the city. Secondly, immediately find the location of Ms. Alisa and bring her back. Third, inform the whole city, if anyone uses the coin of 100 yuan denomination, please inform the police immediately, if you can become The bank will give a reward of 10,000 yuan for the bank. Fourth, conduct a citywide search and search, go door to door, don’t bother, don’t ask you to find them, but you It is necessary to make a determination to find them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now what we need is not to let the robbers quietly go somewhere and wait for the wind to come out again, and It is forcing them to leave here and give them more pressure. Set up sentinels on the outskirts of the city, maybe they will show up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gentlemen, this is my current task. I have any direct contact with me. The bank awards I mentioned just now are equally valid for everyone present. Who can provide effective clues to help us detect success? There is a reward of 10,000 yuan. If you can catch any robber directly, there will be a reward of 20,000 yuan. "He paused and let everyone have a process of understanding and acceptance. "Okay, now I will meet." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
