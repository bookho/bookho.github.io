			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxes, who was hit by a gun, directly plucked the pistol on his chin in Amp’s surprised eyes, and he sorted it out. His clothes walked calmly to the side of the sofa he had just done, and Ms. Sophia made a cup of coffee for him. He took a sip and took a look at Amp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp’s expression was first of all shocking. He didn’t think that Mr. Tucks had such great courage to push a scorpion’s muzzle on his chin. Then the expression became suspicious, and he watched Mr. Tucks walk calmly to the edge of the sofa, and even when he walked behind Sofia, no one was wary of him. Finally, Amp revealed his thoughts until Mr. Sofia's entourage sent Mr. Tucks a cup of coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp’s expression on his face has become a little embarrassing, but he quickly recovered. He sighed heavily. “You must not Mr. Tucks himself?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Tucks licked his mouth and took a handkerchief and stained the water stain on his mouth. He showed a pair of Very regrettable, but there is some ridicule. "Mr. Tucks may be playing hide-and-seek with the fish on the seabed. I am not Mr. Tucks. I am a backhand arranged by Mr. Doolin. Everyone often calls me two. No. Operator. I have already confessed my identity, so Mr. Lapuan, should you also confess your identity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are good friends Although I am not sure what your real name is, the name Lapuan is definitely a fake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Tucks..., no, accurate For the second operator, Mr. Du Lin is a line buried by Du Lin, a back hand. He moved from the Tener area to the city of Illian and partnered with the real Mr. Tucks to open a jewelry store to secretly melt the gold bricks he had grabbed from the Imperial Bank and sell them to all locals. In this way, people and foreigners have successfully avoided some of the suggestions that Amp gave to the imperial central bank. There are no bricks or bricks in the underground money-laundering channels and sales channels, and they have avoided The biggest danger when Lin started his family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This method of selling is very special, making money a bit slower, but safer and earning more. This way, you don't need to face up to 50% of the sales fees in the underground sales channels, and you don't need to consider someone going into the jewelry store to check whether the gold products belong to the robbed goods, 30 million. Gold can also sell for nearly $45 million, and Du Lin is applauding for his brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after a period of operation, he found a big problem, that is Mr. Tucks's problem. According to the agreement between Mr. Doolin and Mr. Tucks, Mr. Tucks has not much equity and has no power to interfere with business. But when everyone has a little money, about a million, Mr. Tucks thinks that the jewelry store should be made into a brand, not only to expand the scope of business, but also to independently create a studio of masters, specifically for the official The service of the nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the normal business conduct, Mr. Tucks is a business man who is very business-minded and uses the brand effect to promote luxury classified brands, but this and Du Lin’s The intention is contrary. The gold in his hand could not be seen. Once the size of the jewelry store has grown, the number of stores has increased. Those colleagues will come to trouble, and it is easy to undermine his temporary low-key plan. Then two people quarreled. Mr. Tucks may have discovered something, and he used Du Linin to make a mistake. He asked Du Lin to pay him a large sum of money to let him develop business and restore the family's glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Mr. Tucks went to the sea to fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin also realized that he might have left a flaw. Mr. Tucks can see that his gold is in trouble, then others Nature can also be seen. So he quickly recruited four shareholders who did not exist in the name of Mr. and Mr. Tucks to confuse the line of sight, and also sent an accountant to accompany Mr. Tucks to fish together, and then from the Guartes. I found a qualified accountant and revised all the books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid someone catching this vulnerability in the future, Du Lin found a person who looks like a four-pointer with Mr. Tucks. He has a brand new identity and arranged him to live in the Federation. There is nothing more effective than the goal of being a man! At that time, Du Lin gave him a goal of ten years. If no one came to catch this loophole within ten years, then Mr. Tucks would be able to come back. I didn’t expect anyone to actually chase this loophole, and it’s still two people. It is the real windfall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the second time someone chased this line, that is, when Amp, who claimed to be Lapuan, was chasing this line, Du Lin had already put Irian The jewellery shop was sold to a foreigner. All the books were approved for destruction after they were checked for taxes, and they disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Amp finally woke up. He squatted for a while, then laughed out loud. "I knew that Doolin is always a bastard." People have a kind of surprise. How did he think of doing this?", no need for fake Mr. Tucks to answer, and no need to answer Ms. Sophia, Amp reveals a naughty smile like a child, "He gave me a surprise. But I also have a surprise to give him, can I call Mr. Doolin for a call?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Tucks nodded. "Of course, but not here!" said he said to Sophia. "Mr Lapuan seems to have invited Miss Alisa to come here. The next thing is to ask. You, try not to let her know what happened..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, Mr. Tucks drove with Amp and several gunmen On the outskirts of a warehouse on the outskirts of Montreux, there was a public telephone booth outside the warehouse, and Mr. Tucks advanced to call Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, Du Lin received a phone call, walked out of the villa, and took a bike about a mile or so to find a The phone booth dialed the phone back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's me!", the moment the phone was connected, Du Lin said, but he did not say his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other one on the phone, Amp, laughed again. This voice is too familiar to him. He not only listened to Du Lin at close range, but also on the phone. I have heard that Du Lin’s call has been monitored. This voice is familiar to him and can’t be familiar with it. But after the laughter, he sighed and said the same sentence, "It's me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ends of the phone fell into silence After about two minutes, Du Lin asked. "I just heard my brother say that you want to give me a surprise. To be honest, this is not a surprise at all. It is purely frightening. But I still have to congratulate you, Mr. Ampu, congratulations. How can you get back to hell from hell? How dirty is the dirty air? And you seem to have the strength to continue to ask me trouble, I can ask, why is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Napu is very interested in chatting, he immediately replied, "Of course, you are not dead, how can I be willing to suffer in hell, so I am back. As for why I am chasing You don't let it go? Because the answer is simple, you make justice dusty, you make justice unbalanced, Doolin, you are the biggest cancer of the empire, if you can't let you down, the ghost knows what you can do!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right Are the answers satisfactory?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin snorted, “very satisfied, but Mr. Ampu, I need to remind you that you are unknowingly In the case of losing another game, is this the way you call for fairness and justice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Du Lin's mocking of Amp, he didn't care. He changed his posture and leaned in the phone booth. His face was ruddy and his expression was excited. "Do you remember what I said to you last time? Justice will come, it is only a matter of time. If I can't do it, I believe someone can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sentence is very sad, reminds me of the time when I went to your grave to offer flowers for you. "Du Lin took out a cigarette and ordered it. After a brief silence, he spoke again." Mr. Ampu, I am very respectful of your personal ability. You are the one I invited except Kevin. Two members who don't have the guar pedigree, but can really enter my core position. The last time you refused me, I invite you again now, I need your ability to work for me, can I?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is really optimistic about amp, Amp and Kevin are two kinds of people, and the field of specialization is different. Kevin is the kind of person you give him a sentence, telling him that you are innocent, he will be able to win the lawsuit for you, even if you use the dirty means, it will definitely not be a psychological burden for him. It can be said that Kevin is a shameless person. Kevin is invincible in the legal field, but outside the law, he does not necessarily have to turn around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Amp is different, he is very focused on the details, has keen observation and high patience, he can start to find something different from some subtleties Something, his analytical ability is very strong, although the execution ability is a bit poor, but it is undeniable that this is definitely a good plan to make plans to check for missing. With him, some of Doolin's plans can be more perfect. The most important thing is that Amp is not a partial eclipse. He can do any job, and he can't necessarily work in law and policing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About three minutes, no one spoke, and Du Lin spit a faint smog and was waiting for Amp’s answer. As long as Amp can agree, he will be able to let Amp trust himself, and Amp, who is a bit stubborn and very passionate, can work with him. If he helps him find the direction of truth, he can exert 100% motivation. Du Lin believes that he can become a life mentor to Amp's new path in life, and he is also an expert in this regard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three minutes, Amp’s voice calmed down. “I am very grateful to you today, you still appreciate me, but I need to tell you one thing, Du Mr. Lin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a policeman, you are a thief, we are always on both sides of a coin, this is our ending."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin annihilated the cigarette butt and threw it on the ground. He smiled, whether Amp could see it. "I am very sorry, Mr. Ampu, very sorry. I respect your choice. This is your power. To be honest, I am very Happy, because we have said something because we are still us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not too late, Mr. Ampu, if there is a chance, I hope that we can sit down and have a chat, say hello to my friends, tell them to wait, and I will see them soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Goodbye!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp looked at the phone that was hanging. He shook his head and sent the receiver back to the landline, then looked out of the phone booth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tax" is facing him, the five gunmen have pulled out the pistol, and the time seems to be slow and slow at this moment. Amp took out the cigarette and took out the lighter. The flint rolling on the flint ignited the wick of the kerosene. The flame was like a glamorous girl swaying and dancing in his palm. He looked up slightly, which made the head-ups on his forehead piled up one by one. He saw the muzzle squirting steam, and a bullet screamed slowly toward him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t have any desire to stop escaping. He took a deep breath and the smoke circled in the lungs. Some of them made him bored but attracted His taste made him wink. The first bullet penetrated Polly, and a large crack appeared on the glass of the telephone booth. He played the ash. The soot that rolled down a foot or so from the chest was concentrated by a bullet, and suddenly it became a dust. He took a deep breath again, and the bullet hit him in the chest, letting his chest sink in, forcing him to spit out the smoke he had just sucked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the power is like the water in the broken bucket, which is quickly lost. The cigarette is slowly swirling in the air, and the gunshots around form a A piece of music is like his character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the gunshots stopped, he was already in the phone booth, life was about to leave him, his mouth vomited with blood, his eyes stayed The cigarette on his hand. He touched the cigarette gently with his fingers and wanted to pick up the cigarette, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not do it. There is no more strength in the body, and even breathing becomes difficult. Maybe... No, this time it is really dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
