			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven't seen you, is it new?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the restaurant, one The agent who was ordering the agent saw the strange face standing behind the cupboard and asked him casually. It was difficult for the bright big head to be discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police Investigation Bureau’s food is very good. After all, if such a dangerous job cannot provide better treatment, many people will not stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the statistics of some institutions within the empire, the three most dangerous occupations of the current empire are the police of the police station, the agents of the investigation bureau, and the tax officials of the tax bureau. These three professions have been ranked as the most risky occupations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police don’t have to make much remarks. As the first time to face the crime of emergency agencies, many police officers, especially patrolmen, are very easy to encounter criminals to commit crimes. Cross-fire with criminals, and accidentally become a past tense. In the past year, the number of police officers who had lost their jobs in the entire empire exceeded one thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Defense also talked about this incident at the mid-year meeting. The second president believes that the current criminal organization of the empire has a completely different "progress" from the past. The more fresh means of crime, the more secretive crimes, and more fire support, these three points make combating crime a dangerous job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, gangs rarely had a lot of hot weapons, and pistols were almost the top configuration. But now, many gangs have a lot of pistols in their hands, and some gangs even have rifles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid economic development of the empire has put the entire society in a markedly rising situation, and more wealth in society has stimulated the concept of each gang site, and The desire to gain more wealth. Coupled with the immigration policy, a large number of immigrants are influxed, and some criminal organizations from outside the empire have also poured into this fast-growing country with gold everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conflict between the gangs has intensified, and the arms smuggling business from all sides has begun to heat up, especially based on the investigation and research to draw a surprising conclusion, so far The forces that smuggle the most arms in the empire are actually the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gang with heavy firepower has become the number one killer of the police, which is why the police profession can climb a high-risk career. The investigation bureau mainly detected major criminal cases, and it was often faced with extremely vicious criminals. Rushing was almost commonplace, and some people sacrificed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the tax officer... that is another question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there has been a significant improvement in the welfare of various trades, mainly in daily work, such as a hearty lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very honest and honest middle-aged man standing in the cupboard immediately smiled and nodded a little silly. "Yes, sir, I just got into the job." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agent nodded his head and focused on today’s lunch supply, in addition to the common meals such as steaks and steaks. Some good seafood such as lobster is provided. He ordered two steaks and a prawns, and after purchasing a fruit salad and a meal, he found a place to enjoy its delicious food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things are delicious, the only downside is that the meal is a bit hard, a bit dry, not so easy to swallow, must be simmered with some steak soup Juice is OK. However, this small defect does not affect the evaluation of the whole lunch, at least 95 points of delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more agents are pouring into the restaurant, and the bald cook is constantly being mentioned. The curiosity for him is quickly being eaten by today's delicious food. Instead, many agents believe that the Bureau of Investigation should hire some more professional cooks earlier. At least lunch should be a pleasure, not just a simple stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lunch time is over, the bald cook packs up the things in the cupboard and pretends to have some "packages" on the dining car, pushing the dining car to the office building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every agent has enough time to dine at the restaurant during lunch, they may be due to reports in their hands, or need to interrogate certain criminals, etc. Stayed in the office building. This time someone needs to give them a meal, not only the detectives need to eat, but some criminals also need to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
