			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin, who had been in the hospital for a week, couldn’t help but call Mark. According to their previous appointments, there will be a new round of public opinion. Appeared in the media, more detailed tracking of the secret of Doolin's assassination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until today, Du Lin did not see relevant articles published in the newspaper, there is no doubt that the George family did not let these press releases come out, so Du Lin I hope to know from Mark that what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time he talked to Mark on the phone, he has talked about it carefully, there will be no obvious political position, and there will be no harm to each other’s interests. The content is just a simple mayor who was assassinated and then tapped into a press release similar to the legendary story. This is not any serious news. Du Lin also took the initiative to tell Mark, don't write the content like a political manuscript, to bring a little legend, to have some love and hate, and preferably a little peach gossip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to continue to attract readers’ desire to “read” is to stimulate the discussion and exploration of Doolin and what he has encountered. When he feels similar, he gradually approaches the truth and does not need him to do it. Society and public opinion will make some people eat their own fruits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But everything is over because the second issue is not posted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doolin called Mark, Mark was dealing with the main points of the day, and the George’s feature agency was like a large factory, every day. Thousands of news content will be produced. Some of these news content can be used directly. Most of these press releases are free of political content, and the manuscripts of positive energy are not required for approval. But there are also some articles that are used by serious newspapers to comment on current political behaviors. These require careful reading and finally decide whether they can be published, who will publish them, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blinked his eyes, it’s very time to call, he happens to want to take a break. The glasses were taken off and placed in the velvet. The whole person leaned back on the back of the chair, and the toes point to the ground, and the chair moved to some distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a simple call and heard the voice of Doolin in the receiver. "Mr. Mark, I want to know what happened, why both of us What happens to each other's promises is an irresistible factor or an irresistible factor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Mr. John and Mark said that morning, Mark immediately wakes up and there may be some changes in the political arena of the empire. John has been in the news industry for more than 50 years and has reported countless political news. He is also extremely sensitive to political changes. Maybe he didn't know what changes would happen, the specific content, but he smelled the signs before the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark believes this, as a former teacher, he believes that the experience of all the "predecessors" under the baptism of time and time is credible and precious. So he did it according to Mr. John’s instructions, and did not publish Doolin’s next article. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also knows that Doolin will call him because he has lost faith. This made him a little guilty. He laughed a few times. "There was something that we didn't want to see. My father, Mr. John George, asked me to stop sending news about you temporarily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin had some surprises after listening. He thought that someone had greeted him and let Mark fall into a passive position and did not publish it. It seems that there are other things in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but, what is this about him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a normal transaction, I give you money, you give me something. Now that my money has been paid, you can't give me what I want. No matter what reason you can't get what I want, it's a kind of untrustworthy nature, a bad behavior that violates the contract. Do not let me suffer because of your personal reasons, so Doolin does not intend to accept Mark's statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Mark, I have provided you with better programming ideas, and also gave up 15% of the Empire Star to Miss Nasha. Now, you tell me because things on your side have caused me to lose, and it seems that you don't want to correct this behavior. Is there any problem with my understanding?", Du Lin's tone is calm, some people are like this, when angry, instead It seems calm, because the angry anger is shackled in the body, when the education can not bind this anger, it is the moment of the volcanic eruption. Mark can hear that Du Lin is very dissatisfied now, he can only report with a smile, "Du Lin, you have to understand me, now all the shares are in control." In the hands of Mr. John, although I am his son, this is separate from my position in the family. I am only a CEO in business affairs. I can't change Mr. John's thoughts and requirements unless..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling laughed. "I understand, and I don't need to use such words to cause my curiosity. Mr. Mark, one day you will realize what you did, what I did, no need to contact. Goodbye!", Du Lin hangs up directly. There is no doubt that Mark and John behind him think that the interests he split are not enough for the George family to support him, so they have a bigger appeal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once he asks "unless", Mark will definitely give him a choice question that is difficult to choose. At that time, whether he chooses or not, he They are all passive and they are all deficient, so he cuts the subject here and does not give the Georges a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Du Lin had enough things to do, he gave up the small idea, but now he thinks that sometimes people should be strong, A little bit arrogant, rude! He also realized what Mr. Wood faced in the face of what he felt at the time. You want everyone to wear proper clothes and you can reason in the magnificent hall, but some people like to look at you in the dark alley. Throw the mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at this time you can’t take off the clothes that have been smeared by mud and pick up your sleeves, you will lose only the clothes, not those A man full of mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the Buddha sitting on the sofa and licking the apple, hooking his fingers. Dudu stood up a little helpless and walked to the bed and leaned against the wall. "What instructions, boss?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin grinned, "Let The people of the Imperial Capital burned the three special feature houses of the George family and then let them surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish, boss!" Shaking his shoulders, slowly turned out of the ward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Burnt Press is not the impulse of Dooling to vent his anger, but to pretend to be a prelude to the George family. The first thing to do is to let the onlookers understand that the so-called power is not powerful in the true sense, not invincible. It is not the assets of the special publications that the special publications were burnt, but the prestige of the George family. If you want a strong person to become a meal, you must let everyone know that his outside is strong, and he must directly attack his weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is particularly evident in the natural world of Doolin’s dream world – the champions on the grasslands, even the lions encounter these weak animals, It will also become a defensive side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The George family has accumulated a lot of capital and connections over the years. The reason why the George family can have so many resource allies lies in his feature society. If someone makes him feel unbearable, he can send an article, or many articles, to guide the paradox of the entire Western world to attack each other, so some people become his friends for his feature society, and some people do not want to Become his enemy and become his friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if he doesn’t have a feature? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very interesting attempt. Once the feature agency is burned, the entire imperial newspaper will not get the latest press release in the next few days. Will they sit still? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, certainly not, if someone comes out to guide, will there be some other possibilities? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin does not expect to be able to directly destroy an industry monopoly giant at a time, it takes time, this time the behavior is only Du Lin is releasing a signal, he To tell everyone, someone is dissatisfied with the George family and intends to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This signal is like an invitation to a big meal. The tycoons who are eligible to enter will start preparing their own dresses, their own accessories, their own Female companion. Then sit at the table while you are having a meal and enjoy the meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed softly, the autumn of events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is gradually dim, Grae put on the coat, tired from the book case, as the editor of Yihua News Feature Society, his daily work They are very much. He drank a cup of coffee that had already been cool in the cup, thinking about where to go to relax at night and put on his clothes. When I came out of the office, two hundred work desks in the entire hall were filled with reporters from the special publications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are rushing for the news of tomorrow, and the evening editor of the night shift will continue to review the draft until dawn, that is not his job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he and his colleagues bid farewell to the gate, across the louvers on the huge glass window, he saw two cars quickly parked on the side of the road. Then, a few guys in trench coats and hats came down from the car. They carried a bucket of oil in their hands and walked toward the gate of the special publication. Just as Gramm was not sure what they wanted to do, he saw some liquid being poured on the window by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
