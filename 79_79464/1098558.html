			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Mr. Sail as "internal", the next thing becomes simpler, Mr. Jack’s list can continue to be linked, and even some can be revealed The content is given to these people, so that they have a bottom in their hearts. Du Lin in this regard was handed over to Natiya, which is why he brought Natiya this time. He can't handle anything personally. The federal side seems to have arranged everything. Just waiting to close the net, there are still quite a few problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, those groups that have been targeted may not be able to find anything. Once they realize what they are, they will soon be organized to fight against this force, even directly Doolin. Even if they don’t know what happened in the end, it’s not safe to say that they don’t necessarily “die”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial disaster is not like war. Although there is a win or loss, there is one thing that has a very different performance, that is, whether life can still belong to itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the war, being hit by a bullet in the head is absolutely dead, even if the gods came to the world, they could not save a dead person. However, in the financial disaster, as long as there is the determination of a strong man to break his arm, he has to cut off his important assets and interests, and may not be able to preserve a certain degree of industry and assets. In the world of Doolin’s dreams, in the event of a financial disaster, the people who really have nothing at the end are those who do not admit defeat and do not obey the general trend. They attempt to use their own power to turn things around and finally be beaten by the waves. The "warrior" on the beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he still has a lot of things to do, for example, let these targeted people courage in the upcoming disaster, and they are willing to go positive Fight against disasters, not every one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This requires a lot of people to help him, not just the top figures in society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have read your articles and photos, very influential articles, and some of them have been able to feel the constant boiling of the blood many times!", Du Lin is sitting in a tea restaurant chatting with a reporter. This reporter has his own column in "Good Morning News". He can be a professional writer or commentator, but he always rushes to the first place. On the first line, interviews are often exposed to some so-called “social shady”, which has a high reputation and popularity among the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some people who trust what he reports, and of course he has been doing what he thinks he should do for many years. I have been to death threats and let him shut up and leave the industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he persisted, did not fear any threats, insisted on reporting the news that everyone liked and heard, and once became the man of the "Good Morning News." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such people are rare in this society, not everyone can disguise themselves so successfully, even Doolin can't do it himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, disguise, this is the first feeling after Doolin got his personal resume. The file said that he was threatened with death and pointed his finger at some entrepreneurs. This is very interesting. A group of celebrities, successful well-known entrepreneurs, some have their own in the industry. These big men want to let a small journalist who has smeared themselves disappear, only need a car accident, or a bullet, there will be a short period of public opinion, and everything will return to calm after the hot discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will really explore who killed the little reporter, which is obviously a thankless thing, then how is this little reporter circumvented? These deadly dangers, while still being able to continue to be active in this industry, continue to be the nails of some people, the thorns in the meat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin feels that there is no one behind the small reporter who is not supporting him. All his great achievements may actually come from the "instructions", or " Directional exposure." He serves certain forces and exposes the ugly face of their competitors, which provide him with the necessary personal safety. The supporters behind him reached their own goals, and the small reporters also achieved their own career success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not an ugly and shameless person. What is needed in a commoditized free society is the person who will do things in order to give money, and is still a capable person. This is why Du Lin is looking for him. He also needs a directional exposure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reporter has a very common name, called Ma Jili, who looks like a head of about seven meters, wearing a pair of glasses, short hair, very A capable person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled, a very modest look, "I just did what I should do, I reported the most authentic things, and finally It’s up to the reader to judge, not how good I wrote the article, but their conscience moved me!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perfect answer, set off from the side Everything he reported was true, and he answered very embarrassedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
