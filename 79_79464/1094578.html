			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the evening, Williams invited Befort to find a place to sit together. He had something to ask about Befort, about the so-called second round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been in the trading house for more than half a month, and he has some understanding of the things inside, and some know that some look very much. The success of successful investors is often not their sharp sense of the market, nor their reasonable analysis, but from the "internal news" that everyone knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is internal news? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it’s a plan for a listed company for the next period of time. There are no plans announced yet. These plans will only be announced at the moment of implementation, even Not announced. When people find out, the stock price has begun to rise or fall sharply, causing people to miss one market. However, if at this time, internal members who know the plans disclose the information to certain friends, these people can prepare for admission or leave in advance, pursue maximum benefits while avoiding huge risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the origin of internal news, and the Financial Management Committee also prohibits any form of internal news leakage, affecting the normal financial order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what it says... It’s like the laws of various countries do not allow illegal exploitation of the wealth of others, but there are always some people who are forced by the society to go their own way. Or if they want to make a fortune, they won’t know what to say in law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the law, it is impossible to restrain some people’s madness, not to mention the requirements of the Financial Management Committee? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of internal news, whether true or false, is full of financial markets, making it impossible to tell whether it is true or false, and everyone is eager to get some internal news, but After getting it, I was afraid of being fake, especially those internal news that were very easy and didn't need to be paid for, which made people feel overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Williams wants to ask Befort to have a meal and learn more about what the second round of the market is all about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Befort is a good guy, young and promising, and Williams likes to communicate with him. The two agreed to talk about this in a dancer club that specializes in wearing clothes. It’s not that Williams has any special hobbies, but the dancers who can’t afford clothes are probably the safest place – there’s a separate The soundproof box, as well as the music player, didn't know what was going on inside the door, the people inside said something, and the dim light protected everyone's privacy to the utmost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ordered some drinks and fruit bowls, and then Williams gave the 20th Shield of the Poor Girl who couldn’t even wear the clothes, let her go outside to change a suit, and the dancers knew that they were leaving the box and Close the door. Williams opened the music and poured some wine on Beford. He paused for a while, and he asked, "In the afternoon, you said that there is a new round of market... Is there any good news?" After spending half a month in the trading house, Mr. Williams has been able to master the word "good", which is definitely a huge improvement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Befford smiled and looked down at the glass without talking. Williamson realized what he was. "If I make money, I will never forget." You help me. I am a person who knows how to be grateful, Befort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"William..., can I call you so?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, my friends call me William!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, William, you know The most important thing to do in our business is the source of the news. Only with a few important lines in hand can we get the news in time, so that people can firmly believe in our ability. I can't tell you about me. I got this message from somewhere, but I can give you some tips, pay attention to the newspaper during this time.", Befort took a sip of wine and then looked directly at Williams. "The opportunity is always in a flash. When the waves are only one foot high, you didn't notice it, waiting for it to become a tsunami. Wait, you can no longer touch it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams is still hesitating, he hesitated and asked, "Is it reliable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Befford laughed, "William, I think we are very involved. Don’t you think? I saw you from the office and I am yours. A stockbroker, I think this is the fate between us. The next words may cause you discomfort, but this is the rule of the industry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is the first internal news, you can do nothing on the side, but if you want internal news in the future, it will cost you a lot of money!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also hope that you don't tell the rest of the company about this, because for others, they want to get this message, at least two thousand!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams immediately thought of the most popular marketing in the past two years. A mop company gave away a very practical and very strong mop pole, which cost a lot of money, but only went to their branch offices. If you register your social security number, you can get one for free. That thing is really easy to use, plus a free gift gives people a lot of good feelings. For a time people are talking about what the company is doing. So, it’s good to use a solid mop and don’t want money for everyone to use. Is their company a gold mine? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after a month or two, people found that they only had the mop in their home, and the mop head of the mop had been somewhat damaged. At this time, they faced two choices, throwing away the beautiful and sturdy mop, replacing the old and used mop, or trying to change the mop head for this good mop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they saw a four-nine-nine-nine-snap mop head in the store, which was called a stupid company for just nine months. Time has completed the trip to the market, not only the development of a mop, but also with more daily necessities and home appliances, this case was included in the Bible of the Merchants of the Federal Code of Marketing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams read the book, now Befort is doing the same thing, he uses a free benefit to gain his trust and affirmation, when When he has more needs, he will charge a fee, not a cheap fee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two thousand federal shields can now be exchanged for more than 670 stars, which is not a small amount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Williams just changed out and changed clothes for a long time, or the poor dancer who had no clothes to wear, called back, funded her 100 pieces and let her Be able to buy some clothes to spend the coming winter. In order to repay Williams' generosity and kindness, the dancers who can't afford to wear clothes are doing everything they can to serve the two gentlemen very comfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the night, Williams saw her wife in the living room when she returned home, and her wife was watching TV. The television produced by the Empire has long been exported to the Federation. Some unqualified, unlicensed small factories are also secretly produced, and there are many tape companies in the Federation to provide content for these or genuine or cottage TVs. She looked at a TV drama in the federal country, imitating the plot of the Star Empire, and copying the red fruit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her wife didn’t smile, and there was some mourning on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very clear about what is happening at home now, even if Williams does not say it, she knows. She doesn't know what to do. She is an ordinary class worker. She doesn't know how to deal with the crisis that has already arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door was opened, she took the initiative and greeted the drunken Williams on the sofa. There has been silence between the two, and only the trembling lines of the TV set make it not to be quiet. After a long time, Williams made a slap and squirted a strong alcohol. He just drunk and some silent expressions came alive in a flash. "Know... know, baby, we are saved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tomorrow, come to your cousin, I have something to say to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days, Williams saw his wife's cousin, a guy with a noodle. This guy has not been a good person in the heart of Williams. He has inextricably linked with the local gangs. It is said to help people smuggle things. In the eyes of businessmen like Williams, this is a bad thing. In addition to meeting together in the New Year, Williams usually does not want to see this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, he must see this guy he hates because this person has the way to get the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"William, this is your first time to invite me, let me guess...", he held his chin and looked at Williams for a while, then Suddenly realized, "You must have had trouble, isn't it? Which guy who doesn't have long eyes collided with you? Tell me his name, I will let you see him floating in the sea on the front page of tomorrow's newspaper!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William’s mouth twitched and squeezed a smile. He reached out and shook hands with his wife and took him into his study. “Not so serious. Dear...love." After he closed the door of the study, the two sat down separately. He took the initiative to take a piece of land imported from the empire to his wife. "I heard that you know some financial companies?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wife and brother sniffed the fragrance of the scented music and did not point it, put it in his pocket, so a good land for him to ask for food on the street For people, the value is much higher than the value represented by the land itself. In the face of Williams's problem, he picked his eyebrows. "Of course, have you got any trouble with the money? I still have some money here. If it is used, I will transfer it to you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
