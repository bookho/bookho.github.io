			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the weekend, Du Lin saw Henry, Henry looked a little embarrassed, he was always meticulous hair lost his spirits and sticked to his head, he When I entered the room, I sat directly on the sofa, with my hands and knees as support, and I grabbed my hair. "Hell, you don't know how I was treated during this time. Why don't you inform me? That's my manor, my manor! I should always have some right to know, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin made a cup of milk for Henry, his current It doesn't seem to be suitable for coffee, and drinking milk is good for intellectual development. Although I don't know if this statement is correct, in short, milk is definitely better than coffee. He sat next to Henry with his coffee and said, "You should be as strong as an adult. If I tell you who you are, would you let me borrow your house?", Henry had Then for a moment of hesitation, Doolin added a sentence, "No lie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally Henry shook his head, "If I know, I am sure I won't lend you. My God, who are you invited, I never thought that you would really know these people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and pressed his hand on Henry's shoulder, and said with a heartfelt reassurance: "Hey, if you don't want to lend me the estate, do you think I will feel a little angry? Because we are good. Friend, but you refused me a very simple request. Does this make me think you are a jealous person?" Henry thought for a moment and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is a good friend and has organized a country club. The amount of the trip is calculated in millions. The manor in the west is actually worthless. It can buy a piece of land and build a beautiful manor for hundreds of thousands. This is why he is willing to lend the manor to Doolin. Even if Du Lin broke some equipment, even if it was a few rooms, the loss would not be much, and a few thousand or two or three thousand pieces would be enough. But he did not expect that Du Lin did not break his estate, but invited a group of dead guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt that Doolin’s question was a bit strange, but it was strange and not found anywhere, but there was a strange feeling that haunted him. Heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't wait for him to think more, Doolin continues to ask, "I may feel angry because of your embarrassment, and you may also refuse me because of it." The request will be a little embarrassing, and therefore I don't want to contact me. It takes a long time, we have no contact, then friends or friends? Tell me, no, we are not friends. Henry, for a manor and me The invited guests are destroying the friendship between us. I think it is wrong. What do you say? And this fact has not brought any substantial harm to you. No one beat you, no one took you. Something, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like... this is the case!" Henry’s brain was a little chaotic. He touched his own conscience. If he really refused Doolin’s request, he would definitely feel that he would create an awkward atmosphere when facing Du Lin. That is the thing he hates most. In order to avoid embarrassment, it may be the best solution to try not to meet. If this continues, maybe they are really not friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Henry, Doolin is his very important friend, very capable friend. He has been in the West for almost ten years, and he has not made much change in ten years. Instead, his brother, who ran in the malls of the empire, expanded the family business a lot. He will also feel anxious in the middle of the night and feel the powerful helpless sigh of his opponent. However, Du Lin’s arrival took less than five months, and the shadow of the West Mine’s enthusiasm in the west completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very capable young man, even if Henry is reluctant to admit, he has to admit that Doolin is more powerful than him. It is always a blessing to have such a powerful friend. If you become an enemy, it is really very embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a good deal to lose face and irritability with Du Lin in the past few days, and as Du Lin said, This is only a small matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he was interrogated in the chair for a whole day, even though his father used a thick book on his head, despite his My brother tried his best to laugh at his stupidity, even though his wife advised him to stay away from Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Henry still thinks that Du Lin is a good friend, at least he can do things he can’t do, and he is a family with someone who has the ability to make friends. The policies of the past, like his brother, always make friends in the society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry breathed a sigh of relief, patted his cheek, and slightly licked his hand to make him a little scared, and he went out without a shave. This is simply an uncultivated act of confusing. Of course, this is not important now. He needs to tell Du Lin his innermost thoughts. "I want to understand. I want to apologize for my recklessness. This is really a small matter. I should not let such small things come. Hurt the friendship between us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was very satisfied with sweeping his shoulder and handing a cigarette to him, "Hey, explain the words." If you say it clearly, there will be no misunderstanding. I know why you have an emotional attack. This is also my fault. I should make things clearer. If you think this will be your ongoing trouble, you can The manor is sold to me, and I will buy another one next to or nearby. The things that bother you will disappear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! You are humiliating me!" Henry suddenly angered and squinted. "We are friends, best friends. I have never made any real good friends since I left the family. You are My first good friend, you have helped me a lot, but I have nothing to repay you... So, the manor is for you, please don't quit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, Henry said that there is nothing wrong with it. Du Lin helped him a lot. In view of the "refugee" problem, some mine owners feel that the rules of the west have changed, and the cost of losing the slave system will be doubled. growth of. The most intuitive expense is the salary of the miners. In the past four or five hundred slaves, even if five hundred were good, five hundred slaves did not need to pay extra fees in addition to giving them a full stomach. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, after losing slavery, even those who have become immigrants to mine, need to guarantee the minimum salary, and give all other benefits treatment. A miner’s salary ranges from 60 to 80 per month. They are also equipped with safety equipment. They are also required to have enough food and eat well. Everyone needs at least a mine every month. They can't invest more than one hundred in their bodies! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;500 people, is the cost of 50,000 yuan, many mines have a monthly income of more than 100,000 to 200,000, plus the mine protection team Expenditure and depreciation of various equipment, etc., may only earn tens of thousands of dollars a month, and may even face losses. Instead of spending your life and money here, it is better to sell the mine for a good amount of cash, invest in some industries in the South, and maybe even happen to be on the fast lane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the mine owner level, they have enough capital to attract certain companies or organizations, such as the imperial central bank, they have a dedicated investment manager to incite temptation These large depositors invest in other industries. And now that the industry is going uphill, it is often possible to see from the newspaper that a small workshop is being asked for a claim because it cannot complete the order, or that the investment industry of a certain businessman has made a huge return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the premise of social and economic recovery, the profits of the real industry will increase indefinitely. When people have money in their pockets, they will have a desire to consume. In terms of the types of goods in today's society, they are more willing to buy something real. For example, things like food, clothing, housing and transportation will never be eliminated. Nowadays, the brand garment factory is the kind of production line that is very popular. The transformation of the tailoring shop in Otis has driven the transformation of the whole industry. More and more popular brands have hit the market with standardized models of clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
