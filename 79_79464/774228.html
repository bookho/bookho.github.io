			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Fowlers holding a bloody wooden stick in his hand, his brow slightly twisted, and he ordered, "Go and see who it is, tell him I am already asleep, there is something waiting to be said tomorrow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler left the warehouse with a cry, and the moment he closed the warehouse door, the long Shu In one breath, the feeling of darkness and depression in my heart also dispelled a lot. The old Fowlers in the inside made him feel unfamiliar. He could hardly imagine that the old man full of gentleman divisions could actually do something terrible and vicious, just like the demon possessed him. At that moment, he couldn't bear to continue watching, but he couldn't go. He could only close his eyes and pray for a little faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a lingering look back at the temporarily quiet warehouse, he knows that when he goes in again, hell will come to the world again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor people, sad people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and took out some thoughts that shouldn’t be there. He quickly walked over to the door of the villa and looked at the strange three outside the gate. A figure, he still politely asked the other person's name. When he heard that the leading young man was the famous 350,000 Mr., he also spent a while, because he had never heard of any connection between Fowlers and Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, the host has already taken a break. If you have anything, please come tomorrow morning. You should know that the owner is old and has just lost his own. Aiko, for a long time, didn't close his eyes, so I hope you understand." Butler apologized for the apologetic predecessor, but it is clear that Doolin is not going to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of the stewardship that Du Lin is sure that Old Forrest is in the manor, and that couple is also inside. He took out a folded envelope from his pocket and raised it. "Please help me transfer this envelope to Mr. Fowlers. There is something important in it. You must open it yourself."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler heard a step forward and reached out and took the envelope in Du Lin’s hand across the iron gate. Du Lin suddenly grabbed his arm and slammed it. The housekeeper was dragged to death on the iron gate, and a muzzle touched his chin. His face immediately became pale, and his long-term experience at the rich family made him not completely confused. "Mr. Du Lin, what do you mean by this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think I mean?" When Du Lin spoke, he was searching for the housekeeper's pocket, and soon he found a bunch of keys. Du Lin glanced at it. There were more than 20, "Now I mean. Is the key to the gate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler hesitated for a few seconds and closed his eyes. "You are not Mr. Doolin, the blue one." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of the steward, no rich man will do anything like this, even if they are so dirty and mean, they must also show up in front of people. Demeanor in line with your status. For example, the old Fuller in the warehouse, how he hated the two people, did not think about going to the door to kidnap them. He just spent money, found someone, and then sat in the warehouse waiting for the guys to send people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he thinks this guy in front of him is not Doolin, but the muzzle is on his chin, as long as the other party moves his finger, his skull will fly out. . He is the steward of Fowlers' father and son. He has been in this villa for more than 20 years. He has deep feelings for the Flemish family living here. But no matter how deep the feelings, no life is more important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha took the blue key and inserted it into the keyhole. The iron door slowly shrank to the orbit in the wall, and Du Lin let go. But the muzzle has always pointed to the housekeeper. The butler also knew that the current affairs did not make any misunderstood actions. He took a step back with his hands and quietly watched these people walk in from the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rich villas seem to have no defensive measures, and those walls that are only one person tall or not even tall can easily turn over, but in fact these rich In order to protect the safety of their lives, almost all the villa walls are equipped with special things. From the simplest hunting traps to a slightly more advanced alarm device, anyone who dares to cross the wall directly will have a feeling of regret that is spreading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin doesn't want to alarm too many people, so finding the way to get in from the main entrance is the best option. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the gate and re-closing the iron gate, Doolin put away the pistol. "Now tell me where Mr. Fowlers is, I hope he I am not sleeping. I don't like other people to disturb my sleep, so I don't like to disturb other people's sleep, please don't let me be a person I don't like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The housekeeper didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He silently pointed to the warehouse of the distant gardener, and then did not get the words he wanted to hear from Doolin's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of four people went to the gardener warehouse and encountered a bodyguard who was responsible for patrolling in the middle of the night. They just took a look at the four people and took back their eyes. There is a stewardship so they don't need to worry about these people being illegally invaded. And they also know what Old Fuller is doing, maybe these people are another group of people who are coming back from Old Forrest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the warehouse without a shock, the butler knocked on the door, then opened the door and walked in. Old Fuller is sitting in a chair facing the couple smoking a cigarette. Although revenge is very resentful, his age and physical condition do not allow him to engage in such work for a long time. The rising blood pressure makes his head a little dizzy, he needs to take a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All sent? Who is it?", he did not ask back, the woman in the couple he was facing was dying The man was not hurting. He chuckled and applauded. "As soon as you say the person's name, I will send your wife to the hospital for the best treatment. Know? Actually, I doubt if you are love. With your wife, you see that she is so tortured and treated, but I don’t want to use her hand to kill her so that I can always be with your little lover?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fingers of both hands of the woman were cut off by the old Fuller, and there were still a few mouths on the head that were slowly spreading thick blood, even more terrifying is her The lower part of the body, blood flowing down an exposed stick. She was already mad at the hair, only the last breath. She doesn't even need to do anything to her, she just needs to wait for a while and she will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Fletchers vented the anger in his heart, and also felt a fear that made him stand up. Who is it that they are not willing to say anything in the face of death? It was not until this moment that he regretted that he regretted not letting the butler directly give the couple 5,000 yuan. He regretted that he had to "exercise" Little Fowlers, and the result was because of the three thousand pieces that he had buckled. It will become like this today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cigarette in his hand is already a little hot, he took the last bite and stood up, just to give the woman a final blow, a voice rang in his ear . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Forrest, your interest is good? Your butler said that you are already asleep, but I always feel that people like you should not sleep. So early. Oh, I guessed it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Fuller turned sharply and looked at Du Lin standing in the warehouse, his face suddenly became gloomy. He glanced coldly at the butler who looked down and immediately realized what was happening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and looked at Du Lin carefully. He knew Du Lin, but it seems that today is the first time for the two to meet each other. The person is full of strangers, "Is it what you did?" He asked, and then asked himself and said, "You must be right. Only you will care about the direction of this matter. Are you coming out?" "What he means is that Dooling wants to kill them before the two men say the behind-the-scenes ambassadors. "Without your hands, I will solve them soon, and then we will talk about my son. "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled a little, and he turned to ask Buddha. "Do you think I am such a person?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha shrugged, "Who knows!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two laughed, this made the old Flews was a little confused, but when he said something, he suddenly rushed over and punched him in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the old Fuller, who has always enjoyed a good living environment, have been treated like this? The punch went straight to him and he fell to the ground. He struggled a few times and sat up, licking the swollen gang, spitting a bloody spit, looking at the Buddha, and Doolin unbelievably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin went straight over the old Fuller's face and walked to the woman's side. He gently pulled out the stick and the blood seemed to open. The flood of the gate spurted out. The woman's eyes gradually brightened, and a gray face appeared a blush. Her lips squirmed a few times. "I... didn't say it!" Then she looked at her husband, her eyes filled with infinite nostalgia. "Live... Go... Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sighed. "Sorry, I am late."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman shook her head and slowly closed her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man tied to her is holding back tears and looking directly at Doolin, "I want revenge!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that Old Forrests is a well-known high-ranking celebrity of Irian. He knows that he and the old Fowlers are not even a small bug with Doolin, but he still said this. Words. He doesn't know how Du Lin will deal with the old Fowlers, maybe they will talk, but he won't give up hatred! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
