			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does anyone have to pee?", the policeman sitting in the driver's seat muttered, and the speed dropped significantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddhas rushed into Doolin’s ear and said softly: "He is telling us that if we say that we need to excrete, it means that someone behind it will respond, although the car will not Stop, but it will take some relatively smooth roads. If you don't excrete, it means no one will respond, the next road may be bumpy, and the speed will be faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, such "dark words" are full of all walks of life, people do not dare to speak out some words that may be incorrect, but they dare to break the rules unscrupulously. "Peeing" in the process of going to prison is only a negligible one. There are also many whispers in the gang. Especially when the gang may be under official investigation, almost everyone uses slang to replace some keywords, such as "turn off the lights." ", "dairy cow", "seafood" and the like, if no one takes you into the business, it is absolutely impossible to find out what these people mean by what they say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, "The seafood of a certain place has arrived, and a few cows have been born in the ranch. One is particularly lively, and the light is turned off after dark. To be quiet." If someone who doesn't know the inside hears someone saying such a loud voice on the street, they may only think that this is a chat between two businessmen, but if they are explained by "black talk", then This sentence has completely changed its appearance - "The things smuggled in a certain place can come today, and the person responsible for collecting funds for the gang has several new goals, but some people do not cooperate, and when he is suitable, he will be killed. In this way, warn others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, local gang members in the city of Ternell do not need to use slang to communicate with city managers. Treating the way the city is managed is simply the soil of sin. They don't need to worry about pressure from the regional police station. It is enough to consider hostile gangs and gangs who can't wait to get a good job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Buddha finished speaking, he knocked on the iron plate between the carriage and the cab, and through the small palm with two layers of fine wire mesh. Vaguely, the driver in the driver's seat was slightly biased to the co-pilot's companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fat difference. Everyone in the police station wants to send prisoners to prison, but if there is a little money or ability, the harvest on this road Not less. As small as a few boxes of cigarettes for one or twenty dollars, as large as thirty-five pieces of a full box of cigarettes, this road will definitely gain. I was able to win such a good opportunity, or because the two police officers were very excited and effective, and Prando really needed to train some young police officers, so they gave them this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the escort car suddenly slowed down, and the direction of the car changed. Soon the bumpy car became smooth and never suddenly "jumped up" to let the buttocks kiss the iron bench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What time are we? How far is it from the prison?" The car is closed, so it is impossible to judge the escort car through the environment outside the car. Location, and can't judge the current time. According to the plan agreed by Doolin and Prando, they will change the members of the prison sentence at a time of three o'clock at the time of three o'clock, and let a fake "Du Lin" go to prison. Du Lin will take his own car and leave here to return to Tener, hide in the city, and then show up after the end of his sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also considered whether he really wanted to serve his sentence, but finally gave up the idea under the persuasion of the Buddha. The situation in the prison is more complicated and full of special circumstances that are not manpower to resist. If someone really wants to start with Du Lin, Du Lin will not even go to see Pluto if he has no room for resistance. The other party only needs to use enough money to make the warden happy, and Du Lin’s prison will have three more strange prisoners. I have to say here that there are four people in a prison, and six people in many times. It is said that the prisons of the Imperial Capital are two prisons, but this is not the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warden puts the money into his pocket, not so much money to build a new home, not to mention the group of prisoners. Is it not condoning crimes to give them such a good environment for serving their sentences? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as Du Lin changes his cell or roommate, he will have a moment of disappointment, at least he will always sleep, and then those people will be quick and secret The start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin listened to the advice of Dufo, sent a substitute to go in, for which he took out a thousand benefits, let the warden Only one eye is closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver looked down at the clock hanging on the co-pilot and replied without saying back: "It’s already two and fifty, and there are only five out of prison. Km."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said a thank you, and looked at the Buddha, and silently picked up the handkerchief and opened the pistol insurance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan is wrong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be reasonable to say that someone should come to pick it up now, but the car still hasn’t stopped. The ridiculous wildness is in the winter, the wild grass has long been blown by strong winds, and occasionally a tree is bare. If there is someone near here, the driver will be able to see it. He can't see, it means... there are no people around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very wrong, because the plan is not just Planondo's plan, but also Doolin's plan, even if Prando is not strictly enforced, but his people should be executed. If someone who is not his person is killed by someone, they are not coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why didn’t they come? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought about this issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Ellis is here, he can tell Du Lin why they didn’t go to the designated place by time, because someone is attacking the farm and they are preparing When they left, the two trucks parked on a small road outside the farm, and then jumped down to almost twenty people. Almost everyone armed with a pistol launched an invasion of the farm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t find a bunch of pistols in an abandoned sewer from the estate of Godore, it’s only a matter of ten minutes for the farm to be wearing masks and The man in the hat attacked. At this time, Ellis glanced at the clock hanging on the wall, and shot a few shots out of the window after an anxious shot outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this kind of shooting is useless, and the shot-killing range of the pistol is nearly half of the theoretical effective distance. As long as it is more than 20 meters, the clothes that are worn are thicker and tougher, and a bullet is equivalent to being punched by a person. (Winter, the distance of 30 meters, hit, and then, and then continue to run - all of the above is a fabrication, are authors compiled.) Alice can clearly feel that the other party did destroy them The idea on the farm, but not in a hurry, is like a long-awaited battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more terrible thing is that these people are too strange, not only have strong firepower, but also have very rules in action. The word "Leifs" may not understand, he only knows that these people cooperate very well, little by little approaching a house that has been simply repaired, and some places have even been shot through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t think of any other forces in the city of Tener that could make so many pistols, plus the last time the car was sent to Guri. Go, he thinks these people are very likely to come from other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't do this, you must find a way to fight them back!", Ellis looked at the two companions around, they guarded the window. At this time, I had to thank the farmer who had been confusing with the mud at the bottom of the agate river. He had repaired the house very simple. There was only one door and five windows on the first floor, making it easy to defend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, someone said: "I remember that the cellar originally went to the No. 1 warehouse. I don't know why it collapsed. If we dug out from there, it should be able to appear behind them!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This information is timely and important, and Airlie turned to be ready to talk, his body trembled, and the painful color fell to the ground. He was dragged to a relatively safe place, licking his mouth and licking his waist, slowly releasing his hand, and everyone else was relieved. No blood was seen, indicating no breakdown, but a warhead that had been deformed like an irregular coin had shattered his coat and lay quietly on the underwear. He took the warhead and thought about loading it into his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Each window draws a person, there is a tool in the cellar, and now I dig.", saying that he stood up with the help of his companions "The other people cover them and strengthen the counterattack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, the strength of the counterattack in the window suddenly strengthened a lot, so the slow-moving mysterious people Suspended the pace of his continuous advancement. If the pistol is not used, it is estimated that there is not much ammunition on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About ten minutes, Ellis saw a figure flashing in the door of the No. 1 warehouse, he breathed a sigh of relief, "Every window only Leave one person, the others go to the first warehouse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice is on the side of the exchange, there is already a foreboding of Doolin, and will soon face The same situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car that escorted them stopped, and the police officer sitting in the cab whistled. "It looks like you have a great big man. It’s called Du. Lin's guy? This scene is really big enough, I hope you are not like the goods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened outside?", Du Lin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know if you look down?" The driver pulled a pole and the car’s body made an unpleasant sound, and the door slowly opened. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the driver’s hippie smile turned to the guy outside the driver and asked: “Brother, what did you bring to us?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the gunshot sounded a bullet shot through the driver's head, and the co-pilot's police officer was also exploding in the panic of the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
