			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new year is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma sat at the table, holding Mr. Xiaoxma in his arms, and his face was barely smiling. He is very satisfied with his current life. In the past, he thought that restraining and controlling children is the most powerful protection for their growth, but now it seems that his method is wrong. Only by letting the children leave the protection of the eagle, they have the possibility of soaring in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason has now stabilized the position of the director of the Tenel City Police Department. The biggest difference between him and the former police chiefs is that he is very good at speaking. Also very rich. Good talk makes people willing to be close to him, while having money makes people willing to listen to him. Du Lin will give him enough money every month to build his own team. He also used the money well to maintain the police team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has his own independent personality and thoughts. When Prando is in office, everyone’s life seems to be good, and Prando always accepts The black money that comes out is taken out and divided for everyone, so that everyone benefits. But he also has a strong desire to control the police at the police station. He said that what can be done, then it can be done. If he says that someone can't do something, then someone will definitely leave the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more money in the pocket, but it also loses the position of independence. Everything must be done by Prando, no matter how good or bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police chief behind him was arranged by the governor. It was very strict and did not allow any errors in the police station. Even if it's just a small thing, for example, if the file is misplaced, it can be scolded and deducted. What is even more terrible is that in the event of a vicious case, the police chief will give the detective a time limit, half a month or a month, or other time limit. If it is not completed within the time limit, then the initiative will be deducted. salary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A boss who only knows the strictness of the boss gives everyone the independence and position, but the high-pressure working atmosphere makes many people can’t stand it, not everyone It is a detective, and people are constantly making mistakes, and people are constantly being punished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayson is different, he is always laughing and joking, please go out to eat if something is fine, or go to somewhere to play for one night. For the cases that have already occurred, he only asks everyone to do their best to detect it, and has not issued any indicators. For some things that have been wrong, as long as it is not a big apology, it will end, and will not deduct anyone's salary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange thing is that under the leadership of such a less serious, less powerful control, the security of Tener has been unprecedentedly improved. Of course, if you ignore the fact that some well-informed Guars provide the necessary clues for the police, the police in the Tnel Regional Police Department is definitely the best of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the second son Merlin... Although Mr. Kesma is not very satisfied, he feels that it is necessary to go to school, at least to have more knowledge. It is a good thing for someone who needs to live in this society. Plus, Su Rui has some sensation, and her stomach is very satisfied with Mr. Kesma and Mrs. Xema, and some small problems naturally disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Du Lin...that is a jerk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma is very rude to give Du Lin a short evaluation, only two words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children and grandchildren, there is nothing more comfortable than this, plus eating and drinking, this is the happiest New Year that Mr. Kemer has ever lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If..., yes, if. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Walter is not here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 8 o'clock in the evening, the door of the house where Mr. Kesma lived was ringing, and he glanced at Mrs. Then went to the edge of the closet and approved a coat. There is a mezzanine in the jacket, and his two favorite weapons are inside. Dulin's bastard has caused so much trouble outside. Mr. Kemer is not ignorant, so he needs to be wary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is outside?", he did not open the door directly, one hand has been inserted in his arms, as long as the other party’s answer does not satisfy him, he does not mind First shot through the door. As for whether you will miss the wrong person, that is the arrangement of the gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no answer outside the door, Mr. Kesma will open the insurance, ready to shoot at the cat's eye, while Mrs. Kesma's hand is also pressed under the table. , pushed open a template that can be slid open, there is a very exaggerated pistol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the weapons of the members of the entire Blood Dawn organization are not made by themselves, they are all from the nobility. From Layton to Mr. Kesma and Mrs. Kesma, their used weapons were once the most precious collection of a nobleman, or the favorite weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I!", just as Mr. Xerma wanted to pull the trigger, the sound outside the door sounded. He was very familiar. He inserted the gun back into the clothes compartment, opened the door and stood outside the door. Walter, shivering in the snow, frowned. "There will be a New Year, I am already enjoying this moment, but you bothered me!" He spoke and let Walter come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s all old folks for decades. In addition to some things happening in the middle, there are some gaps between them. In fact, the feelings are good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt shakes the snow on his body and walks in. His face is pale like a vampire in the knight's novel who just climbed out of the coffin. He hung the coat on the clothes rack at the door, and then the follower Mr. Xema went to the restaurant. The fire in the fireplace is burning, and the snow makes some firewood so moist, so there will be some sound when burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Xerma let his youngest daughter give up a position and pointed to the chair, "Do you want to have something to eat together?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt shook his head, and he squatted in front of the fireplace, his body trembled. It seems that I saw something unusual. Mr. Kemer asked: "You didn't drink today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No drink...", when Walter spoke The voice is shaking, "I haven't drank it for two days!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer made Mr. Xmas very surprised, Walter's "injury" in the brain, The doctor said that he was over-stimulated and that he often had hallucinations and was accompanied by severe headaches. Poor Walter can't afford an anesthetic, and can't treat anesthesia as a real medicine to treat himself, so he can only paralyze himself through a lot of alcohol, make himself better, and let his life be in the middle of it. Go to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has not been drinking for two days, this is a very serious problem. Mr. Kesma stood up from the edge of the table. He went to the fireplace and found a foot to sit down. "Old man, what's wrong with you? Is it scared?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter looked at Mr. Xerma with a slight head, his expression, his appearance is like being just a few rude bears, the last time he saw him, still in China Mr. Te’s family’s funeral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is back, she is back from hell!", the huge fear hidden in the trembling voice made Mr. Xerma clearly aware of his inner collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said she is back? Who is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huate sucked his nose, Slightly lowering the sound, just like hiding under the bed, afraid of the devil finding his own little girl, the tone reveals that I have a horrible secret that only tells you the feeling of a person, "Anna, I saw her, she came back "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Ma's first reaction is impossible. "Are you trying to make me happy or want to scare me? I am very clear. I remember that I shot Anna’s face and she died. I didn’t drink and have hallucinations?” He waved at Mason, “Go to the bottle of the strongest wine, this poor worm Need to replenish it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Walter slammed up and grabbed Mr. Ma’s neckline with both hands, and the faces of the two men were almost stuck together. "Listen to me, I really saw her, she is back. What should I do? Are we going to transfer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xex Mr. frowned and patted him with his hand on his neckline. "Calm a little, do you really see him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt feels on the temple There was a cold thing against his scalp, so he let go of his hands very interestingly, and he retreated a little. After watching Mr. Kemma take the gun back, he nodded hard. "The last time there was The child found a stranger outside the town. Didn't you let me look for it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw her, she took a fake mask and followed A few young people, they look a bit like soldiers. They turned around and left, I thought I was drinking too much, so I didn’t drink for the past two days. I can still remember all the time I saw her. Memory, this proves not an illusion!", Walter swallowed a sip. "What do we do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma chose to believe in Walter’s words, this The only thing in the world that can make him abstain from alcohol is that he is . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you always want to say that you want to kill her? Now is a good opportunity, maybe you can achieve your dreams...", Mr. Kesma The answer made Walter fall into extreme pain again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
