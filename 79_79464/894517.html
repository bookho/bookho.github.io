			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone was called by Alex’s wife, and she heard that she was very flustered now, and her voice was still crying. “Alex, we The child was kidnapped. What should I do now?" The cry on the phone made Alex realize that it was not a joke, but he didn't understand why his child was kidnapped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has only one child, probably because he has lived in the shadow of the Governor for so many years. He is actually very disappointed with "father love", he does not want to If you have too many children, you will love one of them and let other children get hurt, so he only needs one child. It is unfair that he will be able to give all his father's love to the only child, rather than selectively ignoring who. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfair things He has suffered once and will not let his children take it once again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His child is a daughter, just sixteen years old this year, the birthday that only passed in July, a lovely girl. Her academic performance is very good, Alex did not relax the requirements of her daughter, he invited some tutors. She will also have a good dance, as well as the social etiquette of the upper class, is definitely a dignified and beautiful girl, will inevitably become the darling of the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now she was kidnapped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex let go of the job at hand, stood up, and walked back and forth in the office with his phone, "Relax, dear, relax, How did you know that she was kidnapped?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Letter, there is a letter!", his wife sobbed and said, followed by a burst of hearing The voice of the busy voice, accompanied by the sound of the paper being folded and disassembled, the voice of his wife sounded in the earpiece. "The letter said... We need to prepare 100,000 pieces of cash, and we can't call the police, otherwise they..." Some tragic crying made Alex upset. After two sentences, he asked the secretary to send the documents on his desk to the governor, and then he took the jacket and left the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drove home and saw the letter his wife said, the letter he had already known on the phone, seeing the letter At that time, he noticed that all the words were cut out from the newspaper and were not handwritten. This shows that the other party should not be doing this for the first time and has considerable experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called directly to tell Ed about this, hoping to borrow some soldiers from Ed to help him find his daughter, and at the same time give those who kidnapped his daughter a "lesson." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aid knew the matter and mobilized the team's manpower the first time, and personally brought people over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is going on, how can it be kidnapped?", Ed glanced at the blackmail letter on the table, and after reading it again, he lost it. Go back. He is not a big detective. He certainly can't see any doubts on this letter. He just wants to know what to do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!", Alex sat in front of the phone with his arms folded, and the letter did not say where and when to pay the money, then the other party will definitely The best way to tell yourself is to call. No contact is required, no witnesses are present, and any telephone booth can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And..." He looked at his wife. "You bring two soldiers and take a photo of your daughter to the school and ask." Who saw where she went, and who went, asked clearly, maybe we can find someone who kidnapped her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife wiping Tears returned to the room and took a photo that was recently taken. I sat on the car that Eide brought to the school and went to the school to find clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aide closed the door and sat next to Alex, one hand pressed on his shoulder, pinching hard, "What are you going to do?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Find them!" At this time, Alex's eyes sparkled with sorrow, "and then kill them!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time became slow and tormented at this moment, and Alex’s wife came back at 7:00 in the evening. She asked the people near the school and her classmates. They all said that she saw a very stylish car at the entrance of the school. No one saw what the driver looked like. This is the last impression everyone made on her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex asked a little annoyed: "Is the license plate number? Does the license plate number remember?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His wife stunned and got up and walked outside the door. Alex stopped her. "You don't have to go. Even if someone remembers the license plate number, it is not necessarily true. The other party is premeditated. If you kidnap, you will not leave such obvious flaws. Wait until the other party contacts us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about 8:30 in the evening, the ringing of the phone suddenly sounded, and the people at the table suddenly became alert. Alex made a ban, then took a deep breath and made a phone call. "I am Alex."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound inside the earpiece is like being released from the sheepskin bag. Obviously the other party used some means to make him The sound lost its original taste. "Mr. Alex, I heard that you have made a lot of money recently, and I just need money. It’s just that we don’t know. I want you to ask you not necessarily, so I have to. In other ways."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't talk nonsense, money I am ready, my daughter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your daughter is really very cute. I haven’t cried so far. She is of course very good. Would you like to hear her voice?" Alex immediately confirmed the request, but the kidnapper It seems to be joking with him. "I just made a joke. Before you saw the money, you have nothing. No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn... how do I give you the money? You say a place!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Alex, then you have to trouble you. Before 9 pm, it’s not John’s way to the end. We are waiting for you at John Farm! I hope you can be on time and take what I want. Things brought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone was hung up, Alex snorted and looked at Ed, Ede immediately took the lead In a step, he was somewhat fortunate that John Farm was on the outskirts of the city, where there were few people, and even if there was a gun battle, it would not attract anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is actually a little joke inside, Mr. John is the farmer of John Farm, of course he has passed away, he is a wealthy farm that likes to show off Lord, in the past he intended to leave the city with his name by donating money, and the aristocrats at that time also agreed to his request. The road was quickly fixed, but when the nobility announced the name of the road, John was almost mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the road that the kidnappers said on the phone—not the road of John. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if Mr. John knows in the heavens that the world has experienced so many things, his "not John's Way" still exists, and he and the nobility The story has been circulating, perhaps he should be satisfied, at least the people in this city will remember him and his story. When children ask about the origin of this path because of curiosity, his name and story will continue to spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone left the villa, the entire villa was only the maid's room, and there was no light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a villa across the road from the community, Du Lin put down the curtains. He sat on the sofa with a cigarette and glanced at the tape. The Buddha of the Four Buddhas and the president of the five fellow villagers couldn’t help but complain. "You have seen this thing three times. This is the fourth time. Is there anything good to look at?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha looked at it and thought about it very seriously. "I think it looks good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. "You won, I went to see our Royal Highness Princess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, they are only separated from the house of Alex by a community road, add up Less than twenty meters. But this twenty meters is absolutely a scorpio for Alex and his people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pushed the door of the innermost room on the second floor, a girl was firmly tied to the chair, she flashed the eyes with long eyelashes Looking at Du Lin, there is not much fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is my father coming?" she asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head. "Sorry, they are gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girl's face With a disappointing look, I sighed. "In fact, if you have any requirements, you can not use such extreme means. There will always be a solution, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought for a moment and couldn’t help but smile. "You have a good teacher and a wide range of knowledge, but you certainly don't know that theory and reality are difficult to combine. Solution Do you think that our request can have other solutions? Directly ask your father to borrow a sum of money? Will he give it to us? Well, girl, keep your cleverness, don't shout, then you can go home safely. "Turin smiled and closed the door, then opened the room next door. In the bed, their mouths were blocked because they didn't even have the cleverness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reconfirming that these people’s ropes were not loose and there was nothing around them to help them escape, Du Lin said a good night and closed the lights in the room. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
