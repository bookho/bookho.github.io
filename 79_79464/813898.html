			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people didn’t talk when they were sitting in the car. The problem was more trouble than the imagination. It’s not like Willis’s just doing it. "Guiding" work, stupid cyber has dragged Du Lin into the war for the sake of profit. If he chooses to avoid the war, or does not respond, this is his own reputation, a heavy blow to his plan. He not only has to fight, but he also wants to play beautifully and play fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three chose to get off at the port, they stood in the port, Du Lin smoked, and then found a bench to sit. At this time, no more than before, both Buddha and Ellis were in their arms, watching the people who had passed near them. Their behavior has also made many people willing to go around and do not want to get into trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't necessarily have time to adjust the person's words." Du Lin took a sip of smoke and spit out and spit into a column of smoke. He took another breath. "And our people are still in the hands of Jerez. If they can't quickly disintegrate this group of people, they may be killed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This group of smuggling gangs is not the same as Wood. Graf’s family is not worried about Wood in the hands of Wood. Wood is a loser who has been successfully brainwashed by city rulers. He and Cador are both Virtue, a brain wants to be a figure of the upper class, but does not think about it carefully. If they do not have huge wealth support, if they do not have effective means of resistance, they can become "gentlemen of high society". ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes Du Lin also had to admire the rulers of the city of Tener, who took the mentality of the underlying characters too accurately, they know that these people are the biggest The desire is to become a superior and become a celebrity after whitewashing, so they have weaved a cage for this. When someone's strength exceeds the controllable range, they will open the cage and wait for them to get into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion is only fearful in the wild, and in the cage is just a tool for people to have fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this group of people is different, they don’t want to be the characters of the upper class, they are still struggling at the bottom, they only want more wealth, they are some dead only. Playing Wood's face, Wood will show his "gentleman manner" as the rules of the game, he will not move Graf's parents. But there is no constraint on this group of desperate people. Once they are alarmed, the five people are likely to be dealt with by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this thing is going to be fast, it should be done well, and it can't be done for more than a week. It was more than a week since I was transferred from Irian, and Du Lin’s brow was tightly grasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about launching the local Guar, but this can only be thought of, he has no prestige, and wants to find a prestige in a short time. It's easy for people to stand up, but it's hard for them to be willing to work with Doolin. Indeed, there are interests that can trend them, but this is not something that can be decided in two or three days. One month before the first shipment was sent out, Du Lin began to write letters to the Guar people around the country, proclaiming the benefits, and this was the first step of the implementation of the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it’s too late! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a little annoyed to throw the smoke into the water, the reflection of the shipping wheel on the water, his heart twitching, like opening a switch, Immediately stood up and said that we were leaving, with Buddha and Airlis back to the freighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is an important partner of the Navy, so the ships used for transportation are modified by the training ships, one is to give Du Lin a long face, after all, How to modify the training ship is also a "ship", the shape of the warship can not be changed. The second is to let Du Lin know the sincerity of the navy. If something happens on the ground, as long as they hide on the ship, even if the army comes, it will be useless! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the sea, or the world of the Navy, without the orders of the Prime Minister and the military, they could not let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they are, they can drag Dulin away, this is the navy's confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin, who suddenly returned to the boat, immediately alerted the captain who was resting in the lounge. The captain’s rank was a major, this is his second time for Doolin. deliver goods. The Navy also told him that Du Lin is the most important guest and must not be neglected. Any request must be met. After all, the monthly income of hundreds of thousands of dollars is definitely an amazing income for the navy guarded by the Irian region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these incomes are lost because of naval problems, it is estimated that the old man’s murder is in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the major is called Mengxi. Originally, Du Lin and he said that they would stay here for about four to five days. How come suddenly? He put on his clothes and put on his hat, and immediately went to the captain's room and saw Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Doolin, are you planning to change your itinerary or something else?" He took the initiative to let the waiter pour a glass of wine for Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just thought about it and asked: "Mr. Monsi, I have a new business, I want to cooperate with you, I don’t know if you wish. Unwilling!", he added the word "you" in this sentence, which means that this has nothing to do with the navy, and has a relationship with Mengxi himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the captain of this ship, after leaving the military port, Monsi was a well-deserved "general commander". He just took a little disappointment and smiled and answered Road: "I'm not sure if I can't, let's talk about it and let us discuss it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pointed to the seaport outside the window, "My people were A group of thugs in the city were detained. The mobs bought a lot of relationships and were not punished and arrested. As a member of the empire, I think that I am qualified and obligated to provide justice for imperial citizens and evil for justice. Mr. Chang, what do you think?", he said with a light cough. "Of course, as a businessman who is responsible for society, I am willing to take out 10,000 pieces as a reward for rewarding the heroic citizens of the imperial government to uphold justice." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first half of the sentence, Mengxi was unwilling. In the absence of combat instructions, the Navy, including the Army, was not allowed to enter the city, Du Lin. The request made him a little tired. But the latter half of the sentence suddenly made him have a little bit of trouble, the navy is bitter, he went to the major for a month or five or sixty dollars, plus subsidies for seventy dollars in the first year, eight to nine hundred a year. Being able to accompany Du Lin to the sea, even if there is a "non-wartime non-combat mission", there will be a reward of twenty dollars after returning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the twenty dollars to reward a few majors almost fight, if not his relationship with the colonel is good, it is not his turn to do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can Du Lin’s opening is 10,000, wearing more than one hundred navy, one person giving twenty dollars, that is, two or three thousand, left He took a part of it and gave it to the base part, this is a proper amount of income! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Meng Xi is just wearing his own hat, a face of a generous and angry expression of justice, "Mr. Du Lin, you said all this I have understood As the empire's navy, it is absolutely impossible to tolerate such behavior in the land of the empire. Please rest assured, I immediately summon the soldiers!", said that he was sly and straight, and straightened his back to the corner of the captain's room. , lifted the microphone and asked the soldiers to gather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat in the chair and showed a satisfied smile. When the Navy began to serve the merchants, they were already rotten, from top to bottom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, on the deck, Doolin saw the soldiers gathered together, and these soldiers were not comparable to those who were rabble. Although the military has reduced the naval military spending to its lowest point in history, they must ensure that the navies everywhere can afford to eat at least. If even the food can not afford to eat, even the military spending can not continue, it is estimated that the navy is about to make trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current form seems to be ok, in fact, the Navy knows that once the military has found an opportunity, it must be cleaned up. So they did not give up training, in case the sudden disaster caused them to be caught off guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reporting Captain, assembled!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meng Xi took a look at Du Lin, Du Lin nodded and Mengxi stepped forward. His eyes were as sharp as the eagle, so that every soldier who was touched by his eyes looked up. He sat down with a slight smile, and he said, "These two days will be a battle mission. All of them and the Navy have All the things in the relationship are left on the ship. No names are allowed. The non-combat situations in the mission are not allowed to speak. Strictly obey the orders. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don't understand why there are combat missions for shipping goods. The soldiers are always soldiers. They immediately call it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meng Xi nodded, "dressing up, then the port gathered, loose formation!", he finished talking to Du Lin, "I Also change a suit, you can wait for us below, I will stay with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said, please take the Buddha and Ellis got off the boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When waiting for these soldiers in the port, they all whispered: "These people are very good, will they be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t finish his words. He felt that these navies didn’t recognize people. If they had any hard bones in the future, they would use the navy. As long as you don't hurt yourself, it will not matter if you spend a little more money. After all, it is a big boss who has 70 million! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head. "This idea can't be there. Remember, we are just businessmen. We can hire the Navy to transport goods for us, so that they can It is convenient for us within a certain range, but there must be no more ideas. This is no way, or do you think I will use the navy?" He snorted twice and explained the reason, that is, fear of Buddha and Ellis’s brain is unclear and he has made a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
