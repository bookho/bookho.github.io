			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is destined to be a sleepless night, but it is dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Webster rested for two hours before dawn, when his spirit was very full and he was not as sullen as a night-nighter. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cheeks are ruddy and almost have a light to see through. It seems that he seems to have encountered something good. When entering the town hall, he is constantly passionate with his colleagues. Say hello, just like the month he just arrived in Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Du Lin left last night, he and his family had a phone call and then called his own guide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many political guides in the political arena, which can also be called political mentors. After all, this circle seems to be a place where everyone can be seen, but absolutely Not everyone can go in. There is no adequate background backstage, you can see it, but you can't touch it unless someone takes you inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person with Webster’s entrance is his guide or tutor, and Du Lin also has it, but he does not admit that the gentleman named Hossington also I dare not admit that everyone knows now that Du Lin’s political tutor is his uncle Magus, and Hossington dare not to grab this title, nor can he grab it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Webster’s mentor was annoyed by the phone in the middle of the night, no one had harassed him in the middle of the night for many years, not his The status has improved, and his age is getting bigger and bigger, and people need to take care of his sleep. Even if you are in a hurry, you will wait until you work during the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But his anger was met by Webster after he had finished his experience, and it was extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s current market is so good, no matter whether Magus will really retreat after a year, his influence on imperial politics will be in the future. There won't be much change in five years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years of ruling has caused some things to change, if it wasn’t for Magus, it’s always a new era and new society, he It was only the prime minister of the empire, even if he suddenly said that the emperor would not object. The accumulation of things is not so easy to remove, this is definitely not to say that it is not the thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Webster can catch the line of Doolin, it is definitely a breakthrough for Webster. Du Lin lacks allies in politics. This is something everyone knows. As long as he wants to improve and wants to climb up, he must draw a group of people around him on the political stage to form a new Du Lin. As the core political interest group. Only in this way can he qualify for the things that Magus now has and will lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Webster’s mentor believes that although Magus looks very unselfish, of course he does, but it does not necessarily mean that he really I am willing to completely let go of the influence on politics. Du Lin may be a role in his front-end, he will certainly help Du Lin to climb the top, and then continue to influence the empire by affecting Du Lin. Then at this time, when Doolin’s wings are not full enough, it is the best time to invest in him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two talked for more than half an hour, and his mentor finally told him to do what Du Lin said, don’t be afraid to offend anyone. The more he is wronged, the more harm he receives, and the more Du Lin will make up for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although everyone does not want to admit it, they have to admit that Du Lin may not be a good thing, but in some respects, such as character and credibility He still did a good job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has contributed to Webster’s red light today. He intends to go out and change the future. It’s a bit sad, but it’s also an opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a routine town hall meeting in the morning to summarize the problems found in the government work in the first ten days and the results of the implementation in the first half, and then discuss the work in the latter part of the year. Situation and some handling comments. In fact, this is a very ordinary routine meeting, but today's routine meeting is absolutely different from usual, and some people have to jump out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not someone else, it’s Webster. When the meeting is over, everyone is waiting to get off work, Webster suddenly coughs. With one click, I tapped the table twice. "I have another thing to explain here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remnant power of Doolin was almost cleaned up during the Donald's period. Ernst went to another city to participate in the election campaign. Buck went to the Royal College for further studies, and then two or three small characters also took the initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have achieved great success during the Doolin period, but they have been engraved with the brand of Doolin, even if Webster is at this time It is a matter of principle to decide to rely on Du Lin at the moment and not to use Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has some inexplicable excitement at this time, this is his sometimes fantasizing scene, standing in the conference room to tell everyone that they have to deal with the seven major shareholders And then win, get people's admiration and fear, and thus embark on the peak of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he thought of it, he had a smile on his face, with a hint of incomprehensible emotion, he whispered, "From today, the city hall will Set up an investigation team to investigate the seven major financial issues..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang in the conference room was instantly blown up, and many people were screaming Webster, why do you want to do this, do you know what he is doing, even his own cronies don’t dare to look at Webster, fearing that he didn’t eat some of the door when he went out in the morning. Walnut? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it suddenly stupid? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the jumping clowns in the conference room, Webster’s inner peace is at this moment, his age is coming, because he starts today There are also people who have a backing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This world is so wonderful, Du Lin is now qualified to be the backer of others in politics, which is really wonderful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t mention Webster’s uproar in the town hall, Du Lin’s accidentally looked at an old acquaintance, a lounge once in the mayor’s office The woman who rolled his sheets over him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a woman, Natalie, who was originally the secretary of Doolin, and Du Lin’s also a bit unclear. After Du Lin’s dismissal, he did not Take anyone away. First, after he was removed from office, he stopped working. These government officials may not be willing to continue to follow his system of leaving the empire. Secondly, Du Lin believes that even if he leaves, these people may not have the opportunity to continue to work in Otis if they do not make mistakes. So this thing was settled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he didn’t think was that he considered the right successor, Donald, to do the most out of the matter, whether or not he was instructed by Magus, he couldn’t do it. The things to do, such as the transfer of the main personnel left by Du Lin from important positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Doolin didn’t realize that he would happen to meet Natalie, Natalie didn’t think he would accidentally meet Du Lin, compared to In the simple accident of Doolin, Natalie was a little embarrassed because they rolled over the sheets without responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are here...", this is a special bar. According to the local president, the middle class is consumed here, and here Very safe, it seems that the boss has a little bit of a head, everyone is also giving this bar face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very "clean", there are no such things and people, it seems a bit deserted, mainly because it is daytime, in fact, people are not at night Less, business is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was here that Du Lin was planning to chat with the local fellow president and saw Natalie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat next to Natalie with a glass of wine, and the bartender looked up and looked at Du Lin and took his eyes back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin took a pair of sunglasses, not someone who is particularly familiar with him, Ken Ben can't see who he is, the bartender thinks he has no problem because of his Clothes, his accessories, people who can afford this grade of clothing, will not make trouble in this small bar, it will only make them lose face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t seen it for a while..." Du Lin greeted him. "How are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Natalie looked at Du Lin with a smile and laughed. "I didn't get used to it at first, but people always learn to get used to it, aren't they?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Her slender fingers have been circled on the mouth of the cup. In fact, Natalie's psychological complexity far exceeds the calm she has shown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
