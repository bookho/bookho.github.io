			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brother, do you say we can be chosen?", called Aaron, the younger brother of the Andy brothers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy seems to be about twenty-seven years old, wearing a pretty good dress, including the body of the accessories are valuable. No matter what kind of clothes he wears, he can't cover up the temperament that he can't say on his body, and it's fierce! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat in a chair, holding a bone in his hand and biting the meat on it. "Or, let's try the old way?" After saying these words, he looked at the brother across the table, Klaus Andy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the notorious Andy brothers, who are scattered around them and sit seven or eight people, one by one, as if they can eat through their eyes. The shop that had a good business was gone, and people disappeared in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss and the guy standing behind have to accompany the laughter. Fortunately, these people don’t have the meaning of paying the bill. If they come up, they will pay the money, otherwise he will I really don't know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus, while eating the ground beef and steamed wheat kernels on the plate, looked up and said: "We don't know the details of Doolin's bottom for the time being. The rules come. Your thoughts will be collected first, and so on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many "legends" about Doolin, some say he is from the East Coast. The super rich businessman, some people say that he is the biggest smuggling head on the East Coast, and some people say that he has a good relationship with the Navy and has a relationship with the Army. A total of dozens of rumors and his current presence as the mayor of the city of Otis are indeed more scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple official Andy brothers are not the first contact. Those officials, regardless of their performance, always have their shortcomings. As long as they get shortcomings, everyone will be Good friend. There is no way to send bullets, send bomb models, or simply threaten to go to the door, there will always be people bowing. If this doesn't work, it would be a big deal to go beyond the official to find his superior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s a pure gang, it’s easy to do, and everyone’s confession is one or two. If you can talk together, you will make a fortune together. If you can’t talk, you will start a war. They, apart from those who can’t afford it, are really not afraid of anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the problem now is that Du Lin puts both of these identities together. What if you think he will follow the official channels and suddenly you will be ruined? Or if you started the war in a gang manner, and you came across a group of army, what should you do? So far, everyone is still working very well with Du Lin. Except for many people who have invested in Otis, what kind of person is Du Lin, what kind of backhand is completely unknown? In temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is already a definitive message about Doolin that has been dispersed, that is, Dulin is very reasonable and follows the rules. As long as he does not destroy his rules, as long as he can show his sincerity, Doolin will not discriminate against anyone and will protect the rights of all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the reason why more people can come here, at least one mayor with gang status, for these gang members, purer than The officials are better at communicating. After all, everyone used to be all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aaron licked his mouth and took a spoon to stir the food on the plate. He couldn’t feel how delicious it was because of the delicious food. Compared with these foods, money can stimulate his senses and desires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have also been in the city of Otis during this time, on the one hand to prepare for the future looting, on the other hand, they should consider finding a place to stay, Do some proper trading. In the past few years, they have mixed up, but everyone knows very well. As long as they still eat this bowl of rice, they can't say when they will be planted because they may not know it or have not noticed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to do some legitimate business, at least in the future, if there is an unlucky one, there is still a dependency in the second half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they heard that someone was preparing to take over the bus system in Otis, they immediately became interested. After carefully inquiring about the inside of the public transport system to several good friends, both brothers felt that this was a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the current statute of the empire, the public transport system is basically contracted out for private operation, and the city hall will also allocate a subsidy to the public transport system every year. Many public transportation companies are crying poorly, saying that they have lost it here, and there is a loss, in fact, this is a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no limit on the age of vehicles and mileage in this world. As long as a car is not completely finished, as long as it can run, it can also carry people and run No one has been in charge for a hundred years. The price of a bus is about 12,000 to 20,000, and at least 60 people can be used. According to the city's current announcement of 400,000 people, 100,000 people need to go out every day, and half of them need to take bus passengers. Each passenger needs to pay a fare ranging from fifteen to twenty-five cents. Very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there will be at least two thousand pieces of income a day, except for the loss of maintenance costs, the net profit is about six hundred. This is only a city with a population of 400,000. According to the current development momentum of the city of Otis, more than one million is only a matter of time. In addition to a large number of migrants and many rides, the net profit of one day is two or three thousand. Easy things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the City Hall is subsidizing three or five thousand, a monthly income of more than 100,000 is definitely not a dream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the two brothers were present at the time of the account, they would definitely tell them that they had forgotten the tax, but even if they paid the tax, they would end up with eight About 10,000 or so, is it faster than they are going to grab a steam locomotive, and it is safe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Andy brothers value this attempt very much. Once the City Hall thinks their tenders meet the requirements of the City Hall, they are planning to switch. While they are spending enough, they can also support so many brothers under their hands. When I turned around, I turned from a group of caravans to a tycoon, and I thought about it all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that there are other people bidding?", because Aaron, who had something to eat, could play with the food on the plate and asked again. "Do you want to explore their bottom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus shook his head again, he put down the spoon and straightened up to look at Aaron, whispered "Can you be quiet for a while? From this morning you are more than Bibibi than Bibibi. Do you know that I really want to punch in your face now?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus, who was troubled by Aaron and had no appetite, took a napkin and rubbed the greasy on his lips, rubbed his hands, and got up and walked out. Aaron immediately took two foods and followed them up. While chewing on the food in his mouth, he said, "I am also anxious for our business. You can't blame me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus stopped and squinted at Aaron. "Through me in your mouth, damn, when can you behave like me? Like a civilized person?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? Just because you want to enter the upper class?" Aaron is not afraid of Claus, after all, is a brother, "I said, that is not In our world, we are the cockroaches in the mud, we have to do what we should do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know anything about you. Damn why the mother didn't give you a sound brain? I'm going crazy! Are you planning to be a robber?" Klaus hurried forward after asking a question. Aaron didn't want to talk to him at all, but Aaron continued to chase him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when the two were about to quarrel, one of their men ran from a distance. They found someone to write a tender for them according to the description of the friend, and then delivered it to the government office reception box of the city hall, and then sent people to guard there. As long as there is any little bit of news, they will be immediately known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two brothers were not noisy, and when the man ran to the two, Klaus asked: "What happened? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy held his knees and bent down and gasped several times before he said intermittently: "It seems like our tender was rejected, I see Yade. The people of Lun went to the city hall, I don’t know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his words have not been finished, Aaron has opened him and is moving towards the city hall. Go. Klaus frowned and didn't catch up, but licked his head and let the few men around him follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadron is a gray-powered guy on the side of the nano- Lindes, who feeds about twenty people under his hand, as long as he can make money Are willing to do it. Because the content involved is more complicated, and everything can be done a little, and there are many people who know each other. It is a bottom-level dirty and dirty character, and it is dedicated to "public relations" for some rich people or companies who are willing to spend money to solve troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not sure if Adelaide is coming to compete with him for this public transportation company, so he did not stop Aaron, and Aaron is sometimes more impulsive, too There is no brain, but sometimes he still has advantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, he went to the disaster, and then he did his brother's comeback to clean up the mess. The two brothers couldn't be familiar with this one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron will be a little impulsive, but after all, he does not dare to rush to the city hall to chaos, he is waiting at the door, and several people squatting On the flower bed on one side of the gate of the city hall, people waiting for Yadron smoked with smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About about half an hour or so, he saw that one was not too hot, and the guy in formal suit walked away from the town hall with a smile. Immediately jumped from the flower bed and greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
