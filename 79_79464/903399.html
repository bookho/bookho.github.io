			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the problem so that the high-level government order cannot be implemented and is fully implemented? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this reason Magus does not say that all the politicians present are very clear - interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of interests has caused some artificial obstacles in the process of implementing the decree from the top, when Magus asked for a full-scale prohibition, The owner of an unlicensed brewery workshop spent a little money to find his relatives. His relatives saw the money and found a local official in charge of this. The official had to give a green light to the brewery under the double "wrap" of human feelings and interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green light is the cost, the regulation fee and the labor cost. This fee is definitely not smothered by the ridiculous official, so he will put this A referral to the upper class. For the upper-level characters, one can't affect their fart. They don't interfere with each other and they don't have any negative effects, but the intervention will bring considerable benefits. After the trade-off, they will Put the money in the pocket and open an umbrella to cover the sacred ants that can burn the paramecium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time there will be two situations. In the first case, the paramecium fears that one day the umbrella may not be able to block the light and make them the earth. The nourishment, so they encouraged the upper class to change a larger umbrella, for which they are willing to provide more benefits, and even take the initiative to open the way for the upper class in exchange for their own protection. So the upper-level figure changed a bigger umbrella. Under the umbrella, there were not only the mad dogs that had evolved in the growth space at his feet, but also others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second case, the upper-level characters face more and more benefits from these profit-transmitters, and their ambitions begin to swell and are no longer satisfied with their own umbrellas. So he began to take the initiative to contact more people to support the umbrella, and form a network, a complete network of benefits, in exchange for their greatest value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In either case, ultimately, due to the relationship of interests, the decree cannot be implemented at the grassroots level. Far away, I won’t say it. In the Imperial City, there are more than 30 bars that don’t have a liquor license. Even those bars that got the liquor licenses, the liquor licenses in their hands are probably not obtained before the first prohibition, but in a variety of ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who caused this situation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the City Hall of the Imperial City is the management of the city. Maybe their initial idea is not to get more money in this way. Maybe they just want to make their political career look a little better. I want to have a few more decent clothes for my wife to buy one more. Necklace, let children have more toys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a politician is actually not easy, the people’s exchanges on weekdays will make their wages dwarf, and the meager salary can’t support one. The daily expenses of a politician working in the Imperial City. This point, Marggs knows, Bowworth knows that all politicians know. Therefore, Magus did not point this out. Under the mad plunder of the old party, it is not a big deal to collect a little bit of other people’s political contributions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a protective umbrella, a network of relationships, and finally a huge network to prevent high-level government orders from falling, then this topic returned to the original point, What's the problem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody answered after Magus raised this question, not because he couldn’t answer it, but couldn’t answer it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He caught the weaknesses of these people in one sentence because they are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference is that politicians from nobles and merchants do not need to consider the issue of "bribery" and "acceptance of bribes", such as Magus himself. He is a big aristocrat. Before the establishment of the new party and the power, he owned hundreds of thousands of acres of land and lived in his territory with more than 200,000 people. His possession was enough to form a huge commercial group. Even if you give him a million, in his opinion it may be the normal family expenditure in the past three or five months, he can not be tempted at all. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, these politicians from the civilian population, they are the group that needs to accept bribes, and the group of people who capitalized the banknotes first to conquer - they lack money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Back to our topic, the killing we have seen is positive for us and for this society. At least we know that in this half month In the time, a large number of criminals returned to hell, instead of continuing to poison the empire and poisoning our people. This should be a good thing, not a bad thing. In addition, I would like to ask everyone, has anyone called the police? Has anyone marched for this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head with a smile, "No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gentlemen, this is a very special period, a process that has not yet found an export in the process of transformation. We reserve the right to complain about their actions, but we stand on one side and calmly watch what they are doing.”, Marques began to guide these people and instill their ideas. “They are a knife to help us. Eliminate some of our sins that we can't do for the time being. When they lose control and turn into sin, it's our turn to eliminate them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for Mr. Doolin The practice, I only represent my personal opinion is a positive attitude, and he did not instruct anyone to do anything, everything is spontaneous behavior under the temptation of capital interests."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, Mr. Doolin talked to me about two things in the last two days about how to prove that imperial citizens are imperial citizens. Through our chats and discussions, let me realize our country. There are some of me I didn't think of the place I didn't see. Mr. Doolin asked me a question, how to prove that an imperial citizen is a true imperial citizen. I admit that I am caught in a loop that cannot go out."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I told him that only the citizen's relatives and friends need to provide proof, you can prove that this imperial citizen is an imperial citizen. But then I realized another problem, how to prove His relatives and friends are also imperial citizens. If you follow my thoughts, this question may never be answered, because the answer is too horrifying. Then Mr. Doolin told me his idea, that is, for the citizens of the empire. Issue a certificate that proves their identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he finished speaking, he closed his mouth and picked up a cup of tea. The news was released and everyone needs to have one. Accepted process. In the past, Magus had saved a lot of slaves like many nobles. These slaves don't need to give them any salary, they just need to let them go hungry, they will always work, and they will work until they can't move. He will put a chain on each slave, which has a small metal card with the name and owner of the slave and the number registered with the slave administration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the identity certificate is issued to imperial citizens, will it cause some people’s resentment and cause tsunami in public opinion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no bottom to himself. After all, this kind of thing is indeed a bit difficult, but it can be done as well. The foundation of a country is the citizens of the country, and statistics and registration can be very convenient in managing these citizens. In particular, the proposal to establish a complete file by Du Lin, Magus felt very necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the moment a person is born, his life trajectory will be reflected in a document. What good things he has done and what bad things he has done are clear at a glance. When one day he has a certain value to this society, people can read from his file that his current social value is real or illusory. At the same time, this can also create a deterrent to potential criminals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they intend to commit a crime, they should be aware that if they are arrested for criminal acts, the stain will accompany their life. They will find it difficult to find a high-paying job, and the daughters of legitimate family members will not be willing to associate with them. Even some citizens have the power they no longer have. Increasing the cost of crime is one of the best ways to reduce crime. He talked a lot with Du Lin, so he will throw this idea at today's meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting room soon got caught up in the hot debate, I am afraid that for some time to come, in addition to the ballot, this is the next major work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not sure that some people want to fight against themselves in a way he can't think of, and even more than that Magus is more active than him to push this piece. Things, in the whole thing, he just did some simple work, and then added the idea of ​​the future of these work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggs told him that the city of Otis can establish the identity system first. If you can’t find too many problems, you will find a way to push the society. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be resistance in the eyes of Doolin and Magus, not much in the city of Otis. The labor certificate is a good way to give everyone a process of accepting new things. Even some non-labor workers want to join the workers' union to obtain a labor certificate. After all, this thing can cost more than one month a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One dollar for those businessmen and capitalists may not be willing to bend over, but for the ordinary working class, this is three days or even four days. Food costs. Moreover, I heard that the Workers’ Union has established a “work-age” system. The working class with a working age of more than two years will increase the annual working age by one year. At the same time, it can also obtain additional subsidies from the workers’ unions based on their working years. The length of service is six cents, and ten years can be sixty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have worked for 20 or 30 years, can you save one or two dollars a month? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
