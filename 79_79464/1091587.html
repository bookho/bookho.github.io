			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the reception, it was not the chairman of the board that was introduced to the black pot. It was the Minister of Justice. Du Lin also had psychological preparations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial central bank’s directors are all very good, how can they stand up and apologize to Du Lin as if they were a fool? Do, then it means that this guy will be kicked out of the board by other directors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of the Central Bank’s Legal Department seems to have recognized his mistakes and expressed his dissatisfaction with the law’s understanding of the law. Lin’s interest expressed a great apology, and he took the initiative to bow down. He did not get up for a long time and asked Doolin to forgive him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natiya standing behind Du Lin always has a proper smile, but his eyes are full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Justice of the Central Bank of the Yaoxing Empire, if the central bank is brought into the political system, the Minister of Justice said that it is a second-long, if simple From the perspective of the central bank and the financial sector, he is also a big man who can make some companies tremble with a cough. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not the most trusted person of the board of directors. Without strong personal abilities and without a broad network of social relationships, it is impossible to become the head of the central bank’s legal department. His minister is much better than a senior partner, the top partner is much more powerful, and his power is much greater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is the kind of person that Lattitia had to look up to in the past, but now he is bent over standing in front of Doolin and begging for his forgiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She glanced at Du Lin, Du Lin holding a glass of wine in one hand and holding a cigarette in one hand, looking at the minister of the law, laughing and laughing, probably In ten or twenty seconds, he made some sounds from his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think this must be a misunderstanding!", Du Lin said, the people around the crowd were relieved, and even some people began to applaud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd constantly rumors that the two sides have resolved the misunderstanding and screaming good voices. Some people are boasting that the imperial central bank can correct the mistakes. It is a model of the industry, and some people praise it. Lin’s chest is broad, and I don’t care about those little things. In short, this is a happy small-scale reception. Everyone witnessed the great friendship and their minds. So everyone did a cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, the Minister of Justice straightened up and walked into Du Lin's hands and held Du Lin's hand in both hands. He shook his hands and gratefully. "This is a very good lesson for us. This tells us that we must do the preliminary investigation before any action, otherwise we are likely to infringe on the interests of others. This is exactly what we least want to see, I need to apologize to you again, Mr. Doolin, sorry. "He said the words very beautifully, ignoring some of the facts, making this thing seem less serious." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your broad mind and kindness made me very moved, thank you for forgiveness, this is very important to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took the cigarette handle and pulled it out of the other's hands and patted the other's arm. "I think we all got the revelation and harvest from here. This is the most important thing, isn't it?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Justice nodded hard, "This is indeed the case!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsidiary The minister quickly left the reception, and the old men finally appeared in people's sights. Although he had a black pot, he actually got a lot of things. As Du Lin said, both of them have gained, and the harvest is not too small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a lawyer who has excelled in the judicial industry, the Minister of Justice of the Imperial Central Bank, after this black pot, may lose the position of Minister of Justice. Because he "made" a big mistake, the image of the central bank was damaged. Although this kind of thing happens many times every year, this time is particularly serious because they have encountered an opponent with innate advantages. But he can get compensation from other aspects, for example, he will successfully get rid of the image of the Minister of Justice and senior partners, and enter the board as a central bank shareholder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely a huge opportunity, even if he can only attend the last position, this is a huge improvement! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The executive director of the rotation took a glass of wine and smiled and walked to Du Lin. The two did not speak, first touched the wine glass, took a sip, the old man Said, "I have experienced many things in my life. I have served two generations of emperors, and I have done a lot of work for the 'new emperor'...", here refers to Magus, for these old people, Magus is new. The emperor, there is a very dazzling pride on his face, of course, this is indeed his very great experience. Not everyone has the opportunity to serve two emperors in the feudal society, and they have been able to contribute to the cabinet in the new era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
