			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two took Kevin’s car to the place where Kevin worked. Actually, it was the office, but Du Lin felt that it should be an independent The small villa of a single family, except that there is no swimming pool and tennis court, and the house may be smaller, everything is no different from the villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin asked the maid to open the door and said: "The ace lawyers in the firm will have an office like this, the property is still the firm, we are just being Authorized to use it.", he reached out and invited Du Lin into the small villa, the two sitting in Kevin's study, the maid took the initiative to close the door, let the two men have Private space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin took some documents from the briefcase and put them on the table and pushed them to the side of Doolin. "In fact, the interior of the New Party is not like people imagined." That's the iron plate. Magus has been in the position of the party leader for 12 years, and he will continue to stay for four years, at least until his prime minister has finished his work. Bowworth is in a position to win the next party leader, and he wants to compete for the position of the prime minister. He is old enough, and if he is wrong this time, he may not have the opportunity to sit in the chair."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the biggest difference now is that Magus intends to nominate Harry to take over his position, so Bowworth and some other non-aristocratic members think that Marques is engaged in the party. Class differentiation." Kevin took out a cigarette and ordered it. "By the way, Magus and Harry are both nobles and big aristocrats, which gives Bowworth and other non-aristocratic members a They promoted Magus in the interior to be The party has been reinstated, and now the people on both sides are fighting very hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin listened to Kevin to explain to him the conflicts and contradictions between the new internal parties. Look at the files in your hand. The document came from a trial in which the Prohibited Investigation Bureau of Mangla City seized the embargoed items of the three trains, but the owners of the items took out the tax payment certificate and legal documents that Du Lin gave them. The Supreme Court of the Imperial City won the lawsuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor of Mangla City filed a protest against the Imperial Cabinet, arguing that the behavior of the mayor of Otis, Doolin, seriously damaged the interests of the empire and smashed the law. The majesty, for the personal benefit of the escort of these contraband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the incident came out, Bowworth stood up for the first time to support the position of the mayor of Mangla, and fired at Harry with his own party whip. It is said that Harry has indulged his shameful Du Lin, and Harry must be responsible for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that this is a political struggle within the New Party. Bauhaus has only one purpose to do this. It is to discredit Harry and let him not reach the summit in the next session. If Harry can't reach the top, then with the qualifications of Bowworth and the achievements of these years, he has become a leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin actually said that he was lying on the ground and had a shell. If he was not managed by Harry, if no one protested, then There is no such thing as a hearing, and he does not need to come to the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After such a thing, Maggs must make a statement, whether he supports Du Lin or not, he must show his attitude and be relatively neutral. In the case, give Harry and Doolin a certain convenience. Only in this way, Harry has hope to take over his position and become the next party leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there is such a hearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean by saying the final result of this hearing, who will be excluded from Harry and Bowworth?", Du Lin is really I am surprised, why I don’t know that I have such an important mission. His mentality was quite good, and he even made a joke with Kevin. "Why didn't you bribe me until Harry or Bowworth so far?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Because you are not very valuable for the time being.", Kevin replied, "This matter will eventually be decided by the ruling team to finalize the ruling. Even if you don't let a fart, they can get the final result."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin threw the documents in his hands directly on the table, and said with no anger: "According to your statement, it doesn't matter if I come and don't come?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin shook his head. "No, the opposite is that at the most critical stage of the struggle between the two sides, your attitude is also very important. I don't know you and What is Harry's relationship? He didn't reveal it to you at all, or he thought you would definitely stand on his side. If you directly admit your mistake at the hearing and express your willingness to reflect, Harry and Magus even if It doesn't make sense to be prepared enough."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded as if he had something, perhaps this is why Harry himself did not pay much attention to Du Lin’s participation in the hearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that Doolin’s interests are consistent with his interests, so as long as Doolin does not say something about mental retardation, as long as he can cope with the past Even if they are not so perfect, they have a way to correct the ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the premise of all this, that is, the most crucial point is whether Doolin’s interests are in agreement with Harry’s interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" Du Lin had a bit of a headache. He was unclear about the ass of the New Party’s top, so he couldn’t analyze any results at all. He threw the question to Kevin. Kevin stayed in the emperor for a longer period of time, and the people he met were more complicated. He must have his own ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Kevin did give him a completely opposite suggestion as Dulin had guessed. "My personal opinion is that you can completely dump the abalone." Voss, once Harry is out, the next party leader will basically be caught in his hands. With your current value and the changes brought to him, Boworth can give you some benefits and rewards after taking office. Everyone is not optimistic about him, so his odds are the highest, it is like a gamble, we only have the highest odds, do not consider the lowest odds."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin frowned and thought for a while, he groaned a little confused eyes, "I don't know Bowworth, I don't know how this person is. After you say this, I instead I think that Magus is a good person." Kevin looked at him and wanted to hear his opinion. He said bluntly: "I can feel the rules of the game that I have made in order to cover my own people. I think such people are quite good. Suitable for being friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt The second prohibition of alcohol and the Bureau of Prohibitions were all written by Magus, but now he has even put these things aside to protect Harry. This kind of self-sufficient superior Du Lin feels good, at least not casually. He went to the black pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Du Lin or Kevin, the analysis and conclusion of this matter is not enough to go deep into the core of the essence of the matter. After all, it is still the party. The problem of dispatch within the dispute, as well as a series of deeper problems that are not known to outsiders, led to the current situation, which is not as simple as two people imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course they don’t think it’s a big problem, at least This is true at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You make the decision, Dooling, I will support you on the 'technical', I will try my best to help you with any need."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin licked his temple and stood up. "It’s still early, it’s better to visit Mr. Maggs. I’m a member of the New Party anyway. It’s hard to come to the emperor and pay attention to the leader’s style. It is also necessary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin shook his head and glanced at the watch on his wrist. "If you do this, then I will not accompany you, I I have to find a Kay to make up for the consumption last night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin spent 20,000 blocks last night, as for whether it is worth the money anyway, Doolin I think so, maybe Kevin thinks it is worth the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggs lived in the first house on the outer imperial avenue of the Royal Palace. The house number is also one. It is not connected like other neighborhoods. Buildings, here are single-family villas with yards. At the beginning, this place lived with the prince of the empire. Later, the guy was "squatting". After the New Party came to power, it became the residence of the Prime Minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearest to the palace, and also closest to the office of the cabinet, it also shows the identity of the people living here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s car was stopped when it entered Imperial Palace near the Royal Palace, and had to walk in the future, and the soldiers also checked Dulin’s Something, and check his identity. After confirming that it is correct, he is allowed to continue to pass. On the two sides of the next section of the road, it is not the office of the imperial department of the empire, the residence of the ministers at the ministerial level, so the inspection is particularly strict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s doorbell on the number one villa, at least a few eyes focused on him, he loosened the neckline and tie, not very good The nervous emotions were also strained by these observers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door is Mr. Magus’s housekeeper, a very gentleman middle-aged man who asked Du Lin’s identity and returned to the house to convey the message, waited About five minutes, Mr. Housekeeper appeared again, and invited Du Lin to enter the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villa looks very luxurious from the outside, but it is not as grand as the outside. There are no precious ornaments and paintings, and there are no dazzling goldsmiths, just like an ordinary residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awaiting for a while in the eccentric hall, Doolin waited for the arrival of Magus, and he immediately stood up to show respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
