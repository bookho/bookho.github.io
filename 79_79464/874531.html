			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stan’s love for this time has been squandered by people who have been harassed, if not for the 100,000 pieces that Du Lin gave him and The federal side is preparing for his medical achievement award, maybe he has found a corner to hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every minute, there are people who want to see him, and they all want to buy from him the patents he doesn’t have, and even want to spend money from In his mouth, he got a way to improve the production of high-alcohol wines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no Doolin standing behind, maybe he has already sold the method of purification, no matter how much it will not be too little. But Du Lin... He is not only the owner of Stan Ein, but he has been supporting his research work and has invested nearly five million. As a scientific researcher, there is still a lower limit on the issue of morality. At least he will not sacrifice everything for the benefit of a businessman. He has to pay a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time he can only clench his teeth and disclose the holder of the patent according to Du Lin’s instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of capital is always pervasive, and the patented paper is quickly turned over from a corner, and then they investigate the future. Star Company, and registrant Clark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The registered capital of the Future Star is only 50,000 yuan, the registration category is scientific research, but the above company address points to a residential house, people will soon find The house. But it is a pity that it seems that this house has not lived for a long time, they look for Clark's information and found that this guy does not know where it is currently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this era without any means of tracking, banks also allow anonymous accounts, the difficulty of finding someone is definitely not imaginable by the human brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the fruit, people returned to Stan's side, wrapped around him and hoped he could take out the information in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Stan’s feeling was going crazy, Du Lin gave him a call and he took a sigh of relief. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, Stan’s announced that he had obtained the authorization of Mr. Clark, the patent owner, would have an authorization method, but only fifteen The number of places and the number of places to be earned must be obtained through bidding. To put it simply, it is to auction fifteen authorized places, whoever gives more money, who can get this method, and can also obtain patent authorization. As for those who have no money... I am sorry, this society is cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the industries that have a relationship with wine have boiled up for a time. With the new data released by Stan Ein, he set some standards for alcohol, and four bottles of wine below 10 degrees can purify a bottle of spirit. liqueur. In this way, using Stein's method to get a bottle of spirits selling for about 30 dollars, the real cost is less than ten dollars? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing can be more exciting than profiteering, even some businessmen are tempted, let alone 300%, that is 100% Profits are enough for them to feed on the rule framework of this society. What's more, the profit expectations of this business are much higher than 100%? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is set on the weekend night, the fourth floor of the Empire State Building, more than 148 individuals and companies participating in the auction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We obviously can eat food alone...", Stan Ain was filled with a kind of regret when he was chatting with Du Lin in the background. Du Lin, who has this technology, can completely keep this purification method secret and not publish it. Then he has the advantage that no one else has, and can make a fuss about the price, such as playing a price war. It is cutting meat for others to drop a piece of money, but for Du Lin, it will be a good piece, and if you drop five pieces, it will not hurt your bones, and there will still be huge profit margins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the price advantage to defeat all winemakers is enough to monopolize the industry, which is a huge market with more than one billion sales per year, if it can really monopolize... ..., I am afraid it will shock the whole world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, Du Lin chose to take it out, which is why Stan I don’t understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a scientist who once graduated from Imperial Academies College, today’s Imperial Imperial College. After graduating, he stayed at the Imperial Academy for a while, and later felt The atmosphere there was not very good, and I chose to leave the private research room for research work. He changed five research labs before and after, and finally these labs closed down, until they were recruited by Doolin, they realized that they had a real place to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin will provide no less than 3 million research funds each year for him to use. If there is a major technological breakthrough, Du Lin will not only give him a Pen bonuses, annual research grants will continue to increase in accordance with the importance and uniqueness of research inventions. This allowed Stan to be captured by Doolin because he had no rebellion, and helped him set up a studio in the Imperial City. The real research laboratory is located on an island 27 kilometers away from the Empire Bay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there have been no huge scientific research achievements in the past six months or so, many things have caught up with the current trend of international technology. Du Lin believes that in the next few years, there will be great products, such as nylon. Dooling remembers this story, saying that a group of scientists in a country in the dream invented this thing, and then quickly triggered a craze and became the darling of the times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very profitable way, and it’s very clean, Duolin can’t guide these people in the specific work of the study, but some forward-looking things he Still able to propose. Sometimes science is like a wall in a dark corridor, you never know when you can reach the end, maybe for a lifetime, maybe the next step is the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have great fears about the unknown. Without the direction, it is very likely that the last step will not give up and choose to give up. There are so many stories like this, such as losing weight, there is no plan, no purpose and indicators, and it is very likely that you will not feel the benefits, you will rush to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Stan Ein and the geeks in the research lab that were abandoned by the major research institutes were also very revered and shocked by Dooling. A guy who has never been to school can actually point them in. He has to say that God may indeed be real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled at it. Stan Ein was a researcher and he knew too little about business. When a person wants to monopolize an industry, he must first have a strong background. At the same time, he needs a very special opportunity, that is, the industry has just been discovered. For example, in the current TV industry, regardless of those senior industry monopolies or ordinary businessmen like Du Lin, everyone is standing on the same starting line, and only in this way can it be monopolized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of private wine industry and winemaking may exceed the limits of the literature, and it is absolutely impossible to rely solely on Doolin for monopolizing this line. It's like a steel tycoon. He can't do the industry's trust any more, because he can't control the mine output of the whole world, can't control the steel industry in the whole world, so he is just a tycoon, not a trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true for winemaking. Doolin can't have thousands or even thousands of formal and family-style workshops in the entire empire. If he wants To monopolize this industry, we must use the hands of others to accomplish this, and this hand is the fifteen authorized enterprises or individuals selected this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
