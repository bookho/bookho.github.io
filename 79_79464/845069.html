			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Igor wakes up, it’s already morning, he is awake by the urine. He looked at some strange sleeping environment, and the whole person stunned and realized that he was kidnapped. He didn't understand why the guy would kidnap himself. He didn't have money. He was very clean compared to other officials. Every month, the telephone user's usage fee was directly credited to the city hall's unified fee account. He can only The place to start is the first installation fee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the opinions of the City Hall and the state, as long as there is no loss, it is also a policy to promote the use of the phone itself. The postman is no longer on the phone, and there are problems in some remote local exchanges. This is also one of the policies of the new party leader, Magus, to strengthen the central authority over the local authorities. So as long as you don't lose money, then the extra will fall into his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t have much money, don’t look at this time and Natalie’s opening is three million, and the rebate can give 50,000, but he really has no money. The deposits in the bank add up to tens of thousands, so he thinks that the other party is a wrong choice if the other party is for money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone? I need to go to the bathroom!", he shouted with a little hoarse voice, and his throat was sore, even if he swallowed There is a feeling of hanging the scorpion. He called several times and no one promised. He looked at the environment like an abandoned warehouse and finally closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A hot and humid heat flow began to spread along his legs, and a sultry warmth spread. He frowned and sighed. Struggling a few times to see if there is a chance to leave here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hands are tied behind him and the binding is tight, there is no loose feeling, he looks at the ground around him and wants to find something Try to cut the rope, but there is nothing but the decaying weeds and the dust on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He screamed a little helplessly, no one promised, he didn’t know how long he had been here, and he didn’t know when it was, just When he was hungry and thirsty, the door of the warehouse was slowly opened in the twisted screams of the raft, and the two figures carried the light and walked in the setting sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Igor squinted at the two figures, trying to tell what they were, but they couldn’t see clearly, only one outline. He licked his lips and asked in a hoarse voice, "Who are you, why are you kidnapping me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them said to the other: "Hey, I know he will say that." The voice was very young, and there was a kind of attraction that couldn’t be said. When the other two approached, he squinted to see the two. The appearance of the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is the Karam he knows, and the other is a stranger he doesn’t know. He looks at the two people with vigilance. The most important thing is that Karam. He told him all his secrets. It’s a hell of a ghost. The other party won’t ask for it. He chose to close his mouth at this time and closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the place where he could not see, all Buddha’s feet were on his face, and Igor’s pain could not close his eyes, tearing his heart The roar of it. Blood flowed down his nostrils and corners of his mouth, and the bridge of the nose looked as if he was too embarrassed, making him a little handsome face that became terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his hand to stop Dudu from continuing to beat him. He walked over to Igor and squatted down, taking a quick handkerchief from his pocket. Open it and wipe the blood on Igor's face. His movements are very soft, just like Igor is afraid of hurting Igor. I just received a ruthless attack from Dudu. At this time, Igor’s body and mind trembled. This young man named Karam knew that he was an official and dared to beat himself. This would inevitably make Igor think too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, it happened to be a person who seemed to be very polite and educated, just like a lost lamb looking for a shepherd. Teared the darkness. He looked up hard and looked at Du Lin. "What do you want? Money, or something else? Open a price, as long as I have it for you, and I promise not to call the police!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that person didn’t answer any of his words, just smiled and wiped the blood on his face and threw the handkerchief to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Doolin, I am very glad to meet you, Mr. Igor." The young man was kneeling in front of him and said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, yes, I am very happy to meet you, sir!", when he was still ready to say something, suddenly a spurt, where did he listen? I have said this name... I remembered it. It was at the meeting of the city hall. The mayor said that the poor place next door came to a rich mayor, which seemed to be called Du Lin. He cautiously asked: "You are from the city of Otis..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling admitted without hesitation. "Yes, I am the mayor here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Du Lin say this sentence, Gore breathed a sigh of relief, the other is an official, and the brother of the new party, his life is safe. He just wanted to chill with Doolin, and when he was climbing, Du Lin asked a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it the first time you sent me to the staff of Nano Lindes? The woman named Natalie.", Du Lin said this In the words of Igor, there were 10,000 wild boars running wild. He didn’t even know that the woman named Natalie was the mayor’s gimmick. If he knew, he would never dare to work on Natalie. Even if he is bold, this kind of thing is not dare to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor is the mayor, don’t see anything in the city of Otis, but the mayor is the mayor, and the level within the party is higher than him, which means He has more power than him, and he only needs to pout to ruin his political life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he squeezed out an ugly smile and wanted to remedy something, Doolin stood up and he sighed softly. "Power is a good thing." It is also a magical thing. It can make some people's mentality change in a very short time, and can also make a good person become a bad person. Mr. Igor, if you are bullying a man, I may stay a little. Some feelings, but you are bullying a woman, and also shouldering the women I have given to her task, you are not respecting me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "All that gives me ugly, people who look at me are not my friends. Treat friends, I will entertain them with the best things, but treat the enemy...", he grinned and smiled slightly Waist, "Goodbye, Mr. Igor. Although the night is long, there is always a bright moment, I wish you a good dream!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha from the pocket Pulled out the pistol and pushed the insurance. When the pistol handle was slightly warm, he continued to buckle. The trigger. Mr. Igor trembled on the ground like a rag pocket, almost his eyes were pulled out by him, and his face rolled red for a few times, eventually ending his absurd life quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha went and met again. He brought a wooden bucket for the sake of the drink. He put Mr. Igor in and sealed the lid. And retired. The two found a ridiculous place in the wild, dug a pit and threw the guy in and buried the soil before they clap their hands and ended the work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
