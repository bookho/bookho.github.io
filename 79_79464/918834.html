			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Kevin struggled to wake up from five girls who had worked hard all night, watching these girls who were tired of working all night, still resting. Kevin was touched by their dedication. He knows that these girls can get the money by their own efforts, whether he gives it or not, Du Lin does not give it, these girls will give them enough money. This is not for the sake of the people, but to protect their status and dominance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Kevin opened the wallet and took out five twenty-dollar bills from the wallet and placed them on the table with a cup. This is a tip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone who works hard is worthy of respect, no matter what they do, noble or low-lying, at least the income they exchange for labor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed to get out of the hotel, the wind blowing outside with a strong autumn, let him feel a refreshing, a little cold. Wrapped in the body of the wrap, the doorman has stopped a car for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman didn’t know Kevin, but he knew the man who came with Kevin last night. This is the guest who the mayor is entertaining. How dare he do it? see? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin took out a few coins in the hands of the doorman, the doorman bent over and said thank you, and wished him during the Otis happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a little different, the senior hotel staff service is very thoughtful and seems to have penetrated people's hearts, but like this, I know that a few good words are rare. see. This is the difference between loving work and not loving work. It can be seen that the city of Otis is a little different from other places. This is different from Kevin, but it cannot be said. Too subtle, difficult to describe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected guests, where are you going?", the driver in the rearview mirror smiled and looked at Kevin through the reflection of the mirror, and pinched I took a hat to show respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin glanced at him and saw that it was a uniform costume, a uniform hat, and the compartment was very clean. He also saw it in the position of the armrest box. Four bottles of beverages, "Can I drink this?", he asked, and wanted to see how the driver answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, sir, this is for the distinguished guests of yours, and it is free. Otis City MRT Taxi is at your service! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The polite attitude and the words spoken by the driver made Kevin stunned. He picked up a bottle of drink and unscrewed the lid. It was a bit sour and a bit awkward. It was a bad taste, but it mixed together and gave a very refreshing feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know me?", he shook his drink in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver did not urge Kevin to say the place of the request, but patiently answered, "No, sir, I don't know you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you so polite to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it is Otis, Mr.!", There seems to be a translucent brilliance in the driver's eyes. "You are here to be the honor of our Otis people. It is our responsibility to provide the best service for your guests, sir."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin laughed, and finally he knew where it was different, and took another drink, "Go to the City Hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Okay, sir. Please sit down, I want to start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out the window is more clean and tidy than the emperor, Kevin suddenly understands Du Lin’s goal is that he can’t estimate it, maybe as they once joked, one day, Du Lin will visit the Imperial Capital and stand on the Parliament Hill overlooking this. Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picturesque streetscape outside the window seems to be no longer attractive, and Kevin is in a state of contemplation. He frowned and recalled the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watched Du Lin from a small bastard who could pinch to become an amazing mayor, but also built the city of Otis into He feels the look of fear. Du Lin has been moving forward toward a great goal. Where is his goal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best lawyer? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is already. During his revenge on Orodo, the firm called him more than once. Some rich people want to go to court and they must be sure He is the chief defense lawyer and has hundreds of thousands of lawyers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has this road been over? When others are still pursuing a greater goal, have they come to an end? Does he want to look at one person in the future to surpass him and become a presence that he needs to look up to? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it shouldn't be like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the best student during his student years. After becoming a lawyer, he is the best lawyer, so what should he pursue in order to live up to the wisdom that God has given him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking time is always very fast, when the driver reminds him that he has arrived, he looks up to look at a very spacious square, and that For the first time, many people saw the city hall building that was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out ten dollars to pay for the taxi, and claimed that he didn’t have to look for it. He closed the door when the driver was nice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he can feel that as long as he is standing in the city, no matter where he is standing, every local person will take him seriously. It is treated as a "noble lord". This is a city of wonders. In such a city, Kevin is willing to spend every dollar in his pocket in order to continue to enjoy the wonderful feeling of being above the 10,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fantastic and terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at the city hall with a cane, and at the reception of the staff he pushed the door of the Doolin office. He leaned his head in, put his hat and clothes on the hanger, and walked slowly to Doolin's desk, standing and looking at Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other for a while, and Kevin said with a deep voice: "Hey, man, you said that I am going to run for the Minister of Justice, or to run for the empire." The lifelong justice of the Supreme Court?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems like a joke, but let Du Lin seriously think about it, he snorted and pointed Refers to the chair next to Kevin. "You can't do the judge, unless you are willing to be a judge of the city court in Otis, and then spend about twenty or thirty years, when you are fifty or sixty and about seven or eight qualifications. Like you, even the old things that are better than you are competing for that position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not Du Lin’s flickering Kevin, Kevin himself is doing Attorneys are also very familiar with the judicial system. Judges are basically stepping up from the grassroots level. It takes a long time, and there is a standard - the referee rate. Simply put, a judge from the bottom to the next level needs to accumulate more than 3,000 trials. In the case, the referee and the defendant both recognized the result of the referee to be more than 80%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to say, if you take over ten cases, you can not exceed two cases. Some people will continue to appeal after the referee, and then continue to expand according to this proportion. After arriving in the state or even after the ministry, even if one day can handle ten cases, I am afraid there are not so many cases. Come to you for review. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long period of time, the indicators are qualified, and then the current judges will retire before they have a chance to fight. If it fails, everyone is almost old and will kill each other. I am afraid that I am almost the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Minister of Justice, do you think if I work in this direction, how long does it take?" He shrugged. "I am political." I don’t know enough about it. Give me a number that makes me happy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin put down a pen in his hand and took a box of cigarettes. Then they were thrown on the table, and the two old cigarettes suddenly began to swallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pour a smog, Du Lin said with a smile: "It depends on when I can become prime minister."<br /><br />&nbsp The Prime Minister has the power to form a cabinet. For example, the current cabinet is basically nominated by Magus and then elected. Generally speaking, everyone will not disgust the Prime Minister in this respect, nor Will sing against the Prime Minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two reasons. First, if the old party’s objection is raised, then the old party will not be in power. Once they are in power, I am afraid that the New Party will retaliate and add chaos to them. Instead of disgusting others and waiting for others to disgust themselves, it is better to let go of such things. The second point is that even if someone suddenly gets a position that should belong to someone else, it is meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the whole cabinet is like a machine, you are not a matching part in this machine, you can’t get the overall bonus, you will also work. There was a lot of trouble, and if you were not careful, you would be impeached and you could only voluntarily resign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin said that there is no problem at all. As long as he can become the prime minister, it is only a matter of words to name Kevin as the Minister of Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This makes me feel like you are under control, it’s too bad, it feels!", Kevin habitually complained, only with Doolin He will do this when he does, "Would you call your boss or your name in the future? You won't because I don't call you boss, will you be embarrassed when I take office?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
