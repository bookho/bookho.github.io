			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17 or eight people entering a bar may not be like a few people entering the bar, these people have been discovered by some people in the first time, a fellow The members quickly bent around and took Du Lin's ear, and told him that the president of the association was also known as the "Messiah" Du Lin. He was a little blindly worried, worried that these people came to Du Lin, after all, the only "big name" in this bar today is probably only Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin puts his hand, "Don't worry, not coming to me." He also has his own ideas for this analysis, his original plan. It was the third time to come to the emperor, but because Magus’s phone allowed him to come to the emperor two days earlier, even if someone wanted to ambush him, it would not be possible to know that Du Lin would come in advance. Unless Du Lin is surrounded by ghosts, or if someone around Magus is going to target him, these people will not be able to arrange them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, he came to this bar as a random pick, originally they intended to entertain Dulin at the Duke of Olmi in the evening - that was the first to be royal The murdered Duke hanged his family on charges of counter-insurgency, and even the dogs were not let go. After the death of the Duke of Olmi, his house was sold to merchants. The purpose of the royal family at the time was to humiliate other people in the Olmi interest group and warned them not to mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a bad smell, when the aristocratic group headed by the Duke of Olmi and Prince Saffron had been fighting the royal family and wanted to be in the eastern part of the empire. The founding of the Principality, but the royal family has not promised. These two great aristocrats have deep knowledge and many followers. Once they have established the Principality, it is very likely that a civil war will erupt in the near future. Their ambitions are definitely not as simple as the Principality. They want the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a series of power struggles, the Duke of Olmi was hanged, and the Prince of Safran took the poison, and the royal family thought that the past was condemned by the military. The Duke and the Prince have great hidden dangers to the empire. Their hereditary title will allow them to accumulate a large amount of strength for each generation. When these strengths are strong enough, whether they are willing or not, they will eventually betray the betrayal. the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s better to let these people become stronger in the future when they have to fight against the royal family. It’s better to kill them when they don’t have these ideas. Stability is more powerful. Thus, there was a cleansing of the aristocratic class by the royal family. For a hundred and ten years, after two generations of emperors, all the princes and dukes of the empire were finally killed, except for the Fatima family. When the royal family wanted to take back some of the "stupid" practices of the past, the Civil War broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that there are two dukes in the hands of merchants who have built the two dukes into a high-end social platform in the form of a private clubhouse, and can temporarily rent some rooms and equipment, in general It is a very high-end place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Du Lin was in trouble, so he changed his plan and chose this bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other party is still rushing to him under the constant change of the original plan, even if he leaves now, I am afraid it is too late. It is better to consider other things, such as... to get the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not blindly arrogant, took a pistol from the young man and broke into his arms and patted the other’s shoulder, let that The young man who is about the same size as Du Lin suddenly felt a flattering feeling, and he retreated to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, these people are not directed at them, these people went directly to the background, the show is still on stage, the bar is still so lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second floor, Ms. Celine’s soulful songs made people still intoxicated and the atmosphere became happy. Alcohol is indeed a good thing to help. The atmosphere soon became hot. One of the classmates took off the thick winter coat and wore summer clothes to wiggle the body between the two sets of sofas. Ramazan sat on the couch holding the glass, and he had a face tonight, which made him feel that there was something that couldn't be said that made him particularly excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, Ramazon wanted to use the public expression of the limelight to pursue Freina’s thoughts. In such an occasion and atmosphere, maybe Freina I promised. However, he quickly realized that all of this is just his own opinion. The well-known Freina belongs to the group of “good students” in the school. Every day, she takes notes carefully and takes notes. After class, she is also studying after school. She is here. Everyone must be more "mature" and psychologically mature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Ramazan suddenly opened his mouth after drinking two glasses of wine, and he thought of another way to approach Freena, which was more stupid than before. The plan is more likely to succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know Baohua Tobacco Company?" When Lamazan asked this, Freena nodded subconsciously, and people often talked about communication. There are three things that can never be lost in the occasion, cigarettes, wine and paradise. The cigarettes produced by Baohua Tobacco Company are not bad. The price is cheaper than those of the federal cigarettes. The quality is not too bad, so there is no problem in selling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that last year, Baohua Tobacco Company's total operating income reached 44 million. The company's chairman claimed to further expand production lines and factories, and launched high-end brands. They have circled a lot of land in the west as a tobacco planting base, and signed strategic cooperation plans with the two western states. In short, this is a company that suddenly refreshes people's understanding of it, always appearing in newspapers or print ads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamazan face with a smile that he thinks is the most appropriate, slightly tilted his head. "We intend to expand market share this year and win more customers." We use our tobacco, so we need some well-known celebrities to advertise for us. If you don't mind, why not try?" He didn't give Folena a chance to talk and continued to rush: " We have provided Ms. Celine with a three-year total of $1.2 million in endorsement fees, which will not be lower than this if you wish!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1.2 million is definitely a high price, and the so-called endorsement is nothing more than shooting a set of print ads every quarter or at regular intervals, making a background board at a very important meeting, but no more than that. Other work, this is definitely a very cost-effective contract. Many stars want to endorse people who are not necessarily willing to use them. Now Ramazan sends an astronomical endorsement contract to Freena, and he does not believe that Freina is not tempted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one hundred and twenty thousand. As far as he knows, Freina had been a CEO in the Empire Star and did not own shares. It was purely a workers. When he opened the price that was significantly beyond his father's price, he firmly believed that Freina would nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t force her to do anything, nor did she ask her to promise herself, just a very normal commercial endorsement contract. But once Freina was willing and signed the contract, she would definitely not be able to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is 1.2 million, not 12,000 or 120,000. She should know how to do it to reward herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s also three years?", 1.2 million is indeed not a small number, and it’s also because Celine’s popular female singer who won the gold medal can Get the first-line endorsement costs, and this is the high price that Baohua Tobacco Company has used for the sake of products and companies. The cost of endorsement of normal first-line stars is about 800,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Freena has a little bit of movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
