			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Wei’an did not introduce the identity of Dufo and Doolin at the opening ceremony. Some parents are a bit curious, but their years of social experience tell them if they don’t ask. You may also be friends. But once you open your mouth, don't say that you are a friend. If you don't, you have to be an enemy. In such a subtle atmosphere, the opening ceremony was finally over after the testimony of the students and the parents of the students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the ceremonial nature of this opening ceremony is higher than the actual meaning, but the aristocratic school does not seem to be ritualistic and seems to be sorry for the nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After lunch, Vivienne repeatedly stayed in the capital, but Dudu eventually refused. He returned to Turner with Du Lin. Originally their plan was to go to Irian, but Doolin temporarily changed the plan and wanted to return to Turner. Although everyone is very strange about this, there is nothing dissatisfaction and doubt. No matter what Du Lin does, he is right. This is their experience and experience over the years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner, Du Lin sent Jinsell to rest. He pulled Dudu and ran out and drove to a black lacquer. In front of the building. The Buddha looked at the dark building and was full of memories. That's right, this is where Fohang went to school, where he was dropped out, and where he was filled with fear and anger. He didn't know why Du Lin was coming here. Was it related to what he said in the morning? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on, come over!", Du Lin shouted after the car, and all got off the bus and ran to the trunk, looking at some things in the trunk. Not calmly watching Du Lin, "What do you want me to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, not what I want you to do, what do we do together." Du Lin handed a stone-filled pocket and a bat to Du Lin, and then took a set of himself. He also had no image to tie the stone pocket to the belt. "You are not saying this." Does the school leave you a lot of unpleasant memories? Very good, let's take it tonight and let those unpleasant things go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo Some of them laughed and waved with the bat, and it was quite easy. "It is necessary, it is a matter of childhood." He felt that Du Lin was nervous, and the fear of the school itself was nothing, but Du Lin. Such a big fanfare is to help him "revenge", but instead makes him feel a funny and absurd feeling, but at the same time, inside There is also a touch of warmth deep in constant ferment spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can there be nothing?" Du Lin asked in a straightforward manner. "I have seen you shivering with fear, but there is nothing? Today we will come to a victory and revenge, crushing the shadow of your childhood!" He walked toward the school gate, took a few steps and looked back at the Buddha. "Follow, bastard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two turned over the wall On the first floor of the teaching building, Du Linnu slammed his mouth and motioned him to smash the glass. After the opposition was invalid, all Buddhas could only pick up the bat and smash a window. The crisp glass breaking sound echoed in the teaching building. Although it was not recognized on the mouth, the inexplicable Buddha felt a kind of unspeakable pleasure. Don't need Dulin to continue asking him what to do. He took the initiative to round the bat in his hand and smashed the second window, and Du Lin quickly followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are like destructive mad, breaking the glass and not talking, but also ran into the classroom to smash some teaching facilities, the sound of destruction accompanied by two people The laughter echoed throughout the school building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it is still very early from school, there are still security guards and staff in the school. Tener's ethos is not very good, gangs are rampant, there have been many gangs or simply school students returning to school during holidays or holidays, some important teaching equipment and so on. Can sell a little money, such as phonographs, projectors and the like. In order to avoid re-purchasing at the beginning of school after the annual holiday, even if it is already on holiday, there will be some security guards and staff in the school to prevent thieves from entering the school for theft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice that came out of the teaching building at that time was simply blatant, and the guards of the three celebrities Gao Mada picked up the rubber stick and pushed the door to the teaching building. One employee chose the alarm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when the three guys just got out of the staff quarters, they had two black men in front of them and pulled out two pistols they. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three guards have already turned over the sky, and even the pistols of the next day did not know to go outside to rob, went to school to steal things, and committed Do you do this yourself? In this year, in Tyrell, as long as there is a gun, you can pull up a small gang anytime and anywhere, and the gang can make more money than stealing things. Why bother them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three guards kept screaming in their hearts, but their faces made a very matching expression. Anyway, someone has already called the police. As long as they don’t anger these people, there will be no What life is dangerous. They cooperated with each other and tied their hands together, and sat honestly on the ground, waiting for the rescue of the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About twenty-five minutes later, the two police officers arrived late. Can't blame the police for being slow, so late is the peak of the crime in the city of Tener. In order to maintain the security of the city, at the request of the director of the Tenel Regional Police, most police officers went out to patrol to deter crime. Molecular madness. Is this effective? very effective! Since the strengthening of night patrols, the security of Tener has been significantly improved. Even the new mayor has commended Mason for his outstanding contribution to maintaining regional stability and ensuring local security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief steals something, nothing more than a loss of property, compared to a shooting case or a more vicious case that may break out anytime and anywhere. Every year, the Medical and Education Management Office of the City Hall allocates a lot of money to the school, enough to make up for the loss of a theft. Therefore, the local police station directly allocated the report to the branch office. The branch office also found two patrol cars near the school on the patrol route, so that when they finished the lap, they went to the school to take a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, after more than 20 minutes, the two police cars finally came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A somewhat bald police officer holds a coffee cup with double milk in one hand and a donut out of the car in one hand, facing the black hole The resounding sound of the teaching building and the teaching building, no matter how eager to rely on the donuts in the hands of the door, his partner took out the pistol, and the other two policemen in the patrol car also The car is down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do I do now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who eats the doughnut shrugged his shoulders," When they have played well, they will catch them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other three police officers looked at each other and counted in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the pressure on the police is also very large, and very contradictory. In their own jurisdictions, crime indices are high and they are subject to criticism because they do not effectively deter criminals in their jurisdiction. However, if there is no criminal act resulting in a case that has not been broken in a year, it may be transferred, and some other people with mixed backgrounds have come. At the same time, there is no crime detection rate, which means that there is no opportunity for promotion. The above will not be the occurrence of criminal acts in the jurisdiction. What they value is the personal ability of the police officers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the jurisdiction of Taiping is not the merit of the police officer, the credit of the mayor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there must be a case in the jurisdiction. It is best to have several idiots grab the jewelry store and then come from the first place. The case with such a huge value and no risk is the favorite of all police. At least their resumes will be very good-looking--on a certain day of the month, the number of thefts will be quickly cracked. It is certainly better than the evaluation. "The police officer did not crack any case because the jurisdiction was very calm." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bald doughnuts were finished, the coffee was finished, he just pulled out the pistol and nodded. The four opened the school gate and turned Slowly touched it inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people who were tired on the fourth floor at this time finally stopped and continued their crazy actions. They sat in the chairs in the classroom and gasped. Haha laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have long wanted to do this!", all of them had a cigarette, and they gave Du Lin, and there were two in the dark classroom. The fire of the group was dark as they swallowed. "At that time, I hated people who learned well. I saw what I lacked from them. They also told me how incompetent I am, even one very Simple things can't be done well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I also want to thank this school. If they didn't let me drop out, maybe I am another way now. I won't meet you, and I won't do things that I think are incredible until now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to thank you, Doolin, if not When I meet you, the ghost knows what I am doing now. It is very likely to be a thug or a killer. It is not on the way to kill, but on the way to escape. You saved me and saved my family. I really don't know. How to thank you, let me follow you in this life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; Du Lin snorted, "Why do I feel a little cold...", he smoked two cigarettes, and his eyes were extraordinarily bright in the dark. "Make sure to like women, Buddha, always like women, promise I must do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You bastard!", Buddha smiled and said, he knows what Du Lin meant, he didn't want these things It has become too heavy, so it is only this "travel" of this evening that there will be a nap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the heart of the Buddha, the most important person is his mother, followed by Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
