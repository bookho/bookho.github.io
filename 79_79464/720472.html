			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The degree is almost the same, you can find a chance to make him make a mistake!", the old man took off his muddy work gloves and threw it aside. With the special satisfaction of the potted plants, this is one of his few hobbies. It may be because of his age, he is not willing to have too many moves, or he may be eager to grow plants, and he hopes that he will be infected with some green plants for a little longer. In short, he is immersed in the craft of potted gardens. He stretched his body and made a few gestures similar to the dislocation of the bones. He relieved with a sigh of relief. "It’s a terrible thing to be old!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He carried his light and turned to look at a provincial black-skinned person. The smile behind his eyes was like the coldness of the ice. "You know how much the city can bring us profits on the books every year." "Why don't wait for the provincial-speaking person with a slightly darker skin to talk, he asked himself: "One hundred and six hundred thousand stars, is it very exaggerated, is it scaring you?", talking about his voice Self-deprecating laughter: "I have forgotten that you have been to a big city, where the income is higher than this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are outsiders, I am afraid I can't believe my ears at all. A small city on the border has a gray income of 1.6 million per year. According to official statistics, this is 10 times more than the total annual tax payment of the city. Is one-half of the city's total output value. Such a huge income actually comes from the gray income! But if you refine this income to every project, every performer, every profit point, then it is not so exaggerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical women, bars selling private liquor, smuggling and trafficking of people, transportation of contraband, income from recreational expenses, extortion, etc. It’s only 1.6 million together, and it seems to be a little less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provincial aristocrat who stood opposite the sun slightly nodded. This guy is Lewis, who has seen the king of the new underground kingdom of the Grand Pier. He is the "subordinate" of the old man. The main purpose of transferring him from the outside this time, in addition to filling the gap after the death of Codor, also hopes to be able to deal with him through him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man continued, "But do you know what the income of the Imperial Central Bank this month is? More than 60,000 stars, less than half of the previous one. This The number should have been multiplied with the release of the second prohibition, but it has not only not improved, but only half of the past, where is the problem?", the old man took a few steps forward and went to a disease In front of the potted plant, push the shelf directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potted plants fell to the ground, and the cracked pots were scattered all over the place. The tight soil in the pots was also scattered, revealing the rotten roots. "The problem is on the body of Xien, his hands are too stretched. Long, not only for the business of private liquor, I recently heard that he is still involved in the business of the sheepfold?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lewis nodded, the sheepfold is a sentence Black, meaning business that buys and sells people. It is difficult to understand the amazing profits without contacting such a business. Kidnapping a girl or a boy has no cost to the gang. As long as they select the target, they only need to get the person back. There is no upfront investment, no post-maintenance funds, but the people they tied back can sell at very high prices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that this is a business with no capital and a profit rate of 10,000 times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All girls or boys who are excellent in all aspects will be sold in other developed places by auction. The higher the quality, the higher the price of the auction. There will even be tens of thousands of pieces of high prices for hundreds of thousands of pieces. As for the low quality, there will be no loss. The number of one or two thousand, the number of seven or eight thousand, has never been slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private wine, population, can be said to be the two pillars of Tener's gray income. Now that Xiuen has discounted the legs of private liquor, and intends to intervene in the sale of the population, this has already touched the core interests of the vested interests of the city of Tener, so they must expel the Xi’an from Tener, or let He shut up forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a plan for these people, and then chose a plan executor, which is Lewis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man licked his mouth, took off the eyes of the golden silk, and rubbed his eyes deep in his eyes. "According to what we said before, If he does not bow his head, send him to see God!", the old man and Lewis are passing by, Lewis bowed his head and bowed, without a trace of hesitation. He went to a big city and learned more about how big the energy of a core in a city is. It is not something he can compete with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To do this, you are the king of the sewer. If you don't do well, where do you come from, go back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man returned to the study room and sat by the window. The light projected through the glass window made him warm all over the body. He opened the book and continued from the morning reading place. Reading, but my mind is thinking about other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Xiu'an Street treated a lineman in a very rude manner, the news was quickly introduced into the ears of the city's head and brain, and they were waiting for this opportunity. When they are calm, they are not so good to deal with. They also gradually realize the true intention of Magus. With the help of his son’s death as an excuse to force the establishment of the Prohibited Investigation Bureau, this knife is indeed enough, but they have already Come up with a solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early days they sent a hacker who wanted to bribe Xiun, but the guy is still locked in the Prohibition Bureau, on the grounds that he is suspected of transporting contraband. Later, they also warned of Xiu En by threatening intimidation, but they were all ignored by the Xiu. There are a lot of ways to kill Xiu, but considering that the boss of Xiu'en is the new governor, they can't use the rough way when they come up, so they choose to follow the rules of the game and make Xiuen go wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as he has made a mistake, he has no reason to stay in the city. If you change someone, you may not have the same grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of a series of erroneous intelligence in the early stage was to let Xiuen feel that he was being played by the city, giving him an impulse to anger and no place to break out. He is like a ball. When the gas in the ball reaches the critical point that the ball can carry, this time only needs a light touch - hehe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolving the grace, the city will return to calm, as it was before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man sinks his heart and devoted himself to reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days of calm have not spent a few days, and Xien knows that he has been played again, and the accompanying agents wearing RCA characters are different in appearance. Going out of the house, I have bypassed Xiu En, for fear of becoming the object of his discouragement. The temper of Xiuen has become worse and worse in recent times, but everyone can understand it. In addition to sweeping bars and some entertainment venues on time every day to check whether there are contraband items for sale, they have not made much achievements in other aspects. Instead, they are played once or twice or three times a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true today. Someone stuffed an envelope into the E-mail of the Bureau of Prohibition, saying that it was here that someone was hiding and selling anesthesia. Xiu En immediately took people over half a city and came here. The result was that nothing was found except dust and mice. Sometimes when he receives information and clues, he already has a hunch that he has been played, but he can't help but can't help but come over. What if he really does? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
