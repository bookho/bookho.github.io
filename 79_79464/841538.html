			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the old man’s encounter, Du Lin’s deep sympathy also gave people a wreath, very beautiful. There are still some morning dew on the petals that are fresh and dripping. As long as they are close together, they can smell a burst of fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you very much!", the child of the old man clasped the hand of a policeman. "Please pass me and my family for me, to Dulin. Thank you very much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old child’s child learned from the communication with the hospital that when the old man came, the leg injury was very serious and the bones were knocked out. It is. In the very urgent situation at the time, if conservative treatment is used, although it is possible to get through the danger and let the elderly continue to walk on crutches, there is also a great risk. Once the operation is unsuccessful, the old man will have to cut off his legs after suffering. The heart and physical pain and blows are likely to cause other situations in the elderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the hospital can only take a relatively radical approach, but there will be no worries, that is, amputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lianmu doctor as the doctor of the rescue room, he is very responsible to explain the situation for the family of the elderly, and he repeatedly stated that as long as the elderly are emotionally stable You can then try to use the prosthetic limb, which may be inconvenient to walk, but you can still walk on your own. Moreover, imperial technology is so developed, there are already mechanical wheelchairs using the use of twins as a power source, and the price is not expensive. The elderly can go anywhere in their wheelchairs to suit their own wishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the explanation of “Lucky” and “Relieved” by the doctor of Lenham, the family of the old man accepted the explanation from him and the hospital, that is, the situation of the elderly. Very dangerous, without amputation is likely to be life-threatening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the hospital also kindly reminded me that if not a few good people send the old man in time, maybe he is already dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a scene like this, when Du Lin sent people a wreath, the old children were very emotional and excited. Even if his father kept telling him that the mayor of Otis was a devil, how jerk he was, he was grateful! If the other party is really a devil, a bastard, there is no need to send him to Nano Lindes, just need to find him a place where no one is, he will be finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party not only sent people all the way to send him to Nano Lindes, but also paid him for amputation and follow-up hospitalization expenses. If this is not a good person, what can be done to be a good person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s child actually understands his father’s psychology. The small place has never had a complete town hall management, so many times the residents are autonomous. The correspondence with the old man and the old man always unknowingly say how powerful they are in the city of Otis, and how many people listen to his decision. Whether this is true or not, the city of Otis now ushers in a complete management, which means that many people think that it is “power” and re-attribute to the city hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the simplest case, if someone has a dispute or a conflict, they will not go to the nearby elders and "decent people" who will seek the police. And the help of the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this suffering, the stubborn old man will certainly not like the new mayor of Otis, and it is a matter of course to complain and hate each other. He has been doing business in Nano Lindes for so many years, and he has already figured out the minds of most people. Furthermore, if it is really the mayor of Doolin who wants to count his father, is it necessary to be so troublesome? Those big men only need one look, one action, they can let the old father eat a squandering loss, and there is no way to say it, which is like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only sent people to Nal Lindes to receive the best treatment, but also paid so much money, the mayor of Doolin really is A good official! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He repeatedly said that the police must say hello to the mayor on behalf of himself and his family, and also presented a bag of gifts, some of the goods he is selling - - dried fruit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is Nano Lindes or Otis, the city is in the heart of the empire, the air is dry, the climate is changeable, and it is not rich in fruit. His dried fruit is sold from the southern coastal areas. It is sold in Nam Lindes and surrounding cities. The business is not bad. Three or five thousand pieces a year can still be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police also smiled and said good words, and finally thanked Fang Fangyuan for sending and leaving things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s child stood outside the hospital and sighed. He came from a hometown with such a motivated and good character. Maybe you can consider it there. Also open a shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he returned to the ward, the old man was still sulking. He sat at the bed of the old man, peeling the fruit for him, and peeling it off. He said, "In fact, I would also like to thank Mayor Du Lin. He saved you after all. Life, and I have to say that this leg is lost, at least you have to live with us...", he was shocked when he raised his hand and prepared to feed the peeled flesh to his father. His old man twitched in his bed and turned white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doctor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dares to stop after solving the two ambassadors Disturbing the construction, the huge AT-1 magic revision engineering machinery is like a child beside the sand, and it is easy to destroy the entire park, and began to dig deep into the foundation. At this time, many Otis people encountered the same situation, a situation that made them a little unprepared and looked awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone wants to buy their house! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask where there is no real estate agent in the entire empire, maybe the city of Otis is one. It has been more than a decade since the bankruptcy of the last real estate company. After the bankruptcy of the last real estate agent, the city of Otis has never built any large buildings, let alone projects such as real estate and neighborhoods. It is like a huge black hole in real estate. Even if a huge real estate company squeezes in, it will be swallowed up with no residue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when did the house in Otis actually sell? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone who was asked if they were willing to sell a house lived near the City Hall, and they limitedly looked back at the dark-painted house, then I also looked at the inquiries, how much money the house can sell, and why buy a house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can give the right answer. Someone happily chose to sell their house in exchange for a cash that they seem to be very suitable, and then use three points. One of them even sold a house for a quarter, and bought it again in a farther place—the houses of the real estate developers were finally mortgaged to the bank, and they only needed to spend a little money to get the house from the bank. Property rights and ownership of the land below the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city is changing very rapidly, and more and more outsiders are pouring into the city, an uninhabited neighborhood outside the city center. When they were pushed down, people finally understood the promise of Doolin not long ago. The city really embarked on a rising road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also on such a day, Doolin was a little unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natalie lowered her head and stood in front of Doolin, this time she put on a relatively conservative dress, her body and round legs They are covered up. She had a little bruise on her left side and some dry blood marks on her forehead. She was accurately beaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natalie left his job five days ago according to Doolin’s request, and went to Nano Lindes to contact the construction unit for the city of Otis Lay a complete telephone line. Her goal is very clear, that is, the telegraph office of Nano Lindes, now the telephone work is managed by the telegraph office, they have mature systems and skilled construction teams, and they are also very familiar with all aspects of telephone lines and computer rooms. So she went straight to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party heard that she was a staff member of the City Hall of Otis, and wanted to lay a telephone network throughout the city. After talking about almost two days, I finally agreed to build 3 million telephone networks throughout the city, and establish a complete and mature computer room for the city of Otis, and train at least five switch operators for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the negotiation, Natalie breathed a sigh of relief, and the other party asked her to sign as soon as possible, but she did not dare to arbitrarily engage in such a thing. Before contacting Du Lin, she found two other contractors through her relationship. After a simple negotiation, the other party gave the highest price of 2.2 million, the least of which was 1.85 million. The same content, and willing to accept the supervision of the construction of the city hall of Otis, there is such a big gap, but let Natalie do not know how to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at least 100,000, or even 200,000,000, she will choose the telegraph office, after all, they are the real experts, but this is worse. One million, she did not know whether the contractors were deceiving themselves or the telegraph bureau’s lion’s mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when she was preparing for the situation and Du Lin’s report, this morning, the telegrapher found Natalie and urged her to sign the agreement as soon as possible. . The other party’s words are not very good, but there is also a feeling of threat, and the attitude is aggressive. Natalie had some resentment, so she told the other party what she had learned from the market, and asked why the other party had a price of one million more than other contractors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then? Then what did they say?" Du Lin placed a chair on the opposite side of him, sat down, and took a picture. Take the chair next to you, "Sit down and say, don't worry, some things are far from being valuable, let me know what I should know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
