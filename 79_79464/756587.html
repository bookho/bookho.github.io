			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male star is called Brown, who is definitely the first-line male star in the movie of the entire empire. There are many fans, and the pay is generally around 100,000. This time I was able to get such a high pay and have the opportunity to participate in the filming of the first color film, and Corina also has a certain relationship. So many male stars, why did you choose him, not because he is now red? In addition, Corinna also wants to take advantage of this opportunity to raise her own worth and position in the film circle. This coincides with Brown's idea. He not only has to leave his own name in the history of film, but also hopes to make his own pay a step in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So anyone can offend him, but Corinna can’t offend, she is not only the heroine of the show, but also the “investor” It is also the "biggest producer". Once she feels that she can't do it, the rich man behind her will definitely change another male lead. Therefore, in the preparation of the filming time, Brown and Corinna hit the hot, and Koko called her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the dispute between Corinna and Freina, he did not pay attention to it, and the role of the human being was so powerful that he could beat the body behind Corinna. That person? After all, the total investment of 500,000 yuan is provided by the rich. Not everyone has so much money to hold a woman. It includes the fellows in Freina’s mouth. He can get 500,000 to hold his own. Hometown? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course it’s impossible, to say a bad one, only need 50,000, crying and shouting that the woman who wants to roll the sheets can follow the statue of Dawn Park. Dawn Avenue lined up to the beach. The infighting of the two men still stayed on the surface, but since the relationship between the two people has not known why it has deteriorated rapidly since yesterday, Corinna does not care about her image and sneer at Freena in a vicious language. Brown doesn't care about it and doesn't want to care about these things. He only cares about when the film can be filmed and when it will be released. If the other teams are able to shoot and release them in one step because of the infighting of two women, he can count I fell a big one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he hates Freina, there is no self-knowledge, but a little actor, there is no attitude towards a little actor, this kind of person is really too hateful It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the hero and the protagonist leave, the crew can only take things away, and can't finish the framing work without the male and female protagonists? In case the male and female protagonists are dissatisfied with the scene they have taken, are they not going to change it in the end? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director stopped when he walked past Freena. He sighed. "Listen to me, Freona. I know that you are a good girl. Sometimes you have to learn to compromise and bow. The world is leaving. We will continue to rotate, but we will stop when we leave the rich. Going to apologize with Corinna, I will talk to her again, try to shoot this movie as soon as possible, and it will be nothing at that time. Are they free?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the director's opinion Freena knew that it was absolutely kind, she considered it and decided to bow. She didn't think about the power of Doolin. Even if she spoke, Du Lin wouldn't promise her that she was completely unsure. It was still a matter of making things too stiff and not finishing. And the rich man who is willing to win her, she does not intend to ask for help, because she knows that as long as she speaks, she will get deeper and deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin is sitting in the study room of Juan, the study is not very big, or the house where Juan lives is not very big, but no one I will take a break from this small house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hu Anzheng and Du Lin talked and laughed, he did not expect Du Lin to have a certain understanding of the wine, which made him feel very close to Doolin. People will have a good impression on those who can understand and even understand their own situation. Together with Doolin's unrestrained tout, Juan's mustache has been constantly shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think you are right. Eric is the guy I know. He has been doing this for a while, if he can use his east coast. As a springboard, the entertainment company is a very good investment in the relationship with the George family.” Juan confirmed Du Lin’s investment behavior in East Coast Entertainment. He pondered for a moment and his fingers were lightly on the table. Two times, "Is there a possibility that we will wholly acquire East Coast Entertainment and then embark on the George family's giant ship for more comprehensive cooperation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said before that he had investment and ideas about the cinema, and he immediately attracted the attention of Juan. If he could become a partner with the George family, then he would have great careers for his future career. The benefits. The George family not only has great influence in business, but its political influence is also awesome, and this is what Juan is lacking. He felt that Du Lin was his own lucky star and his own fortune. When he was not sure about the next step, he took the initiative to send this project to his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought for a while and slowly nodded. "I'm not sure if Eric and his companions will sell all East Coast Entertainment." Shares, but I will convince him as much as possible, even if the price he opened is slightly higher, I believe that the return on our investment is definitely not measurable by money."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The George family intends to lay out in the film and other industries. This area is an unknown world for them. They need to lead the way and need the leader. This is the basis of our cooperation. If we can come up with 100% Sincerity, you may not be able to become a partner of the George family in this emerging field!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said that the shackles, which made Juan also fell into meditation. If he, Du Lin and the George family form a brand new trust in the film, in addition to countless huge profits, the status of their own society will also be greatly improved. If you don’t go out in Irian, you will always be a small family that is inconspicuous. Only when you go out can you achieve the path of making the Juan family prosper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workshops and bars are really profitable, but they only have money and no status. He knows that the little people outside are saying what they are behind, and they are a little angry when they think about it. If everything can develop as described by Doolin, he will also get rid of those who can't mention it. The more he thinks, the more he feels that this is an opportunity, and that Du Lin told him that the small family video player in the Imperial Academy has completed all the research and development work, and it will take a long time to become the main way for people to enjoy entertainment at home. He felt excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not very clear about what a small home-influenced player looks like, but he knows that any form of media needs a content provider. For example, if you have a copy of the newspapers, if you don’t have the George’s special feature syndicate to provide content for these newspapers, they can only print a blank sheet of nothing. It would be horrible if the newly formed company could provide content for this player while taking into account the majority of the entire theater of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of millions of families will need access to these content, even if they only charge one dollar a month, which is an amazing income. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan gradually got excited and his face turned red. Du Lin was still instilling new directions for him. The more excited they were, Juan Actively took out his long-awaited wine from the wine cabinet and opened it for Du Lin and himself without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have stored this bottle for 20 years. Someone wants to buy this bottle with 30,000 pieces. I didn't nod. But today I took it out." It’s my pleasure to entertain my favorite guest.” He was a little intoxicated and sniffed the smell of blood red liquid in the wine glass. He didn’t drink it immediately, but put it back on the table. “You just said I am very interested in those things. If I do this, it will lay the foundation of a family or even a consortium. I don't know why I feel very attached to you when I see you, maybe this is the guide of fate!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
