			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all kinds of book reviews, including other places like Post Bar and a cloud reader, I feel a lot after reading, so talk about this book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know very well that this is not necessarily a pleasing book, just like my and my editors say that people always have to be willful and you can’t make one The person who dreams knows the reality at once, I want to write something I like, no matter what the best result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Live, I want to thank the readers for not letting me give up my dreams and give me the motivation to continue my dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead, I don’t have any regrets, because I follow my own ideas and try my best to live my own appearance, not the eyes of others. appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of this book takes place in an era of change in the world, the conflict between old and new forces, and more things that have not yet been revealed in the book, destined to make this world It is a world of disorder and chaos. In the case of the empire, Magus is keen to reverse the capital of his own hands. He is a very pure person, only wants to do what he wants, and wants to clean up the mess that is more and more uncontrollable. . Therefore, for him, the stability of the empire and the sustainable development of the future are his everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capitalists are completely on the opposite side of Magus, in the past they were small merchants of aristocratic fish, but in the new era created by Magus, money has already From a certain symbol to a weapon, a weapon that can pierce all hearts. Money can buy everything they need, whether it is the dignity, status, decent and power they have not had in the past, or the enjoyment and satisfaction they have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is destined to allow them to focus on their own pursuit of their own career, fighting each other and ignoring something that is of no importance to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people in a country fight and die a lot of people, will Magus pay attention? No, because those who died will not affect the empire's rule over that place. He is more concerned with the officials who have corrupted the capitalists and how many people have become representatives of their interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capitalists will not pay attention to these things. Instead of paying attention to these things that do not affect them, consider how to make more money and how to turn the money into Power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a contradictory era. People call for freedom and justice, but this is precisely what they don't have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an era, nothing is a strange thing, because this is the peculiar charm of this era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people say that the protagonist is always assassinated, always a hard-boiled big man, which is not surprising, because there is nothing in the protagonist except the knife. The power given to him by others can be recovered anytime and anywhere. For example, he was dismissed from the position of mayor of Otis. It was not his, it was given to him by others, so others could take it away. He doesn't really have the power himself. He has only a group of people who dare to fight, holding things that are desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, all the assassinations, battles, I think I have tried to be rationalized. Many readers may say how this might happen, let us go through the history books. A group of capitalists hold the banner of the revolution and even the emperor dares to kill you. Is it impossible, is it brainless? Yy? A group of mafia, who are engaged in illegal trade and collusion with big consortiums, dare to kill you. Is it as unreasonable as a third-rate novel? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September, a mayor in a foreign country in Asia was killed for some reason during the event, my goodness, this already It is the 21st century. It is a civilized society. How can such bizarre things happen? The rule of law system has been implemented in the whole world. Are you not bragging about the author? However, this is the reality. The specific reasons are not described here. In fact, there are only a few of them. If you are interested, you can check it yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the group of people living next to the world police have killed dozens of mayors and hundreds of government officials at various levels for some reason. Even killed the big man standing at the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My God, this is another thing that happened in the civilized society of the 21st century, why are those people not judged? Why are people from those countries not mobilizing the country to seize these people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You ask me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who do I ask? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghosts know why this happens in what we think of as a civilized society? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So compared to what Du Lin did, I think Du Lin is too careful. Even the president dared to kill and assassinated hundreds of officials at all levels, including the minister. What did Du Lin do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading, it’s normal to see some incomprehensible places, because some young readers don’t really think about the age of the story in the book, society Form and political background, without carefully reading a word and a word, to understand the economic form of the world, human history, this does not blame you, blame me. Because I can't write the kind of one-line ten lines, ten seconds to read the three thousand words can also let you know what articles have been written roughly, it is my fault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am very grateful to readers who like this book and can read it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooking food for customers to have a better experience? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it’s for making money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tailor's craftsmanship sewed exquisite clothes to make the guests decent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it’s for making money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women with skilled women passionately show their craftsmanship so that guests can see their own research and hard work to make guests happy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, is to make money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So am I writing this book to make money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, really not, I am for the ideal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the exercise and pursuit of a niche story writer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I write about what I have in my heart, and then let everyone like to watch it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food of the spirit is always more satisfying than the satisfaction of the material food, because all material things will eventually be destroyed, but the spirit is Eternal forever! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to all readers for their understanding and love of this book, and for those readers who have put down the book and sprayed me everywhere, you let me... you I thought I would say that my heart is stronger? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
