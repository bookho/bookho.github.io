			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin, who had just fallen asleep, was called by the Buddha, and there was some cold on the sea cliff. He put on a coat and went downstairs. Totti was anxious. Walking back and forth, a half-size child sat on the side. His footsteps alarmed Totti downstairs, and he immediately greeted him and stood next to the ladder waiting for Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin patted his head and drank a little wine at night. He was a little sober when he fell asleep, and he glanced at the child who was sitting. The gaze moved to Totti's body. "What must I come over in the middle of the night?" For Du Lin, who has no nightlife, it belongs to the concept of midnight after eight o'clock. In fact, his age should be the age of play, for example. Little Fleurs and the like are able to go home without trying to go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't have these hobbies, he can't say that he doesn't have it at all, but he doesn't like it very much. For Du Lin, the Irian at this time is like a second-tier city in a dream, and entertainment venues and projects are like third-tier cities. These things can't attract his attention at all, it's better to stay up early and get up early to maintain a good body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Totto wiped the sweat from his face and swallowed. "Do you remember the couple a few days ago? They were taken away." My personal guess is that Mr. Fuller should do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s eyes finally got a little look, he went to the bar and poured himself a cup Ice water, "How do you know that the people of Old Forrests did it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Totto pointed out to the child, "He looked at those people with his own eyes. Into their home, they took the couple and said that they should let them be buried with the young master. Their family has no enemies and their relationship with the neighbors is very good, so I think this thing should be done by the old Fowlers. After all, he has just died his son. As a father, I can understand his pain, so I don’t think it is impossible for him to do anything extreme."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. "I know this, you go back to rest, everything will be fine tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to stop, but he sees that Du Lin has lost the idea of ​​continuing to talk. He can only sigh and take the child’s hand out of the manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Totti left, Dove, who hadn’t slept yet, came over with a suit, and Du Lin glanced at it and thought about it. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unexpected incident is actually a test for him. If he can bring the couple back, the fame of the fellowship will start within a certain scale. It is imperative now to find where Old Fowlers has taken them. As long as people are not dead, he will be sure to bring them back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call Allis and ask him to go to the bar and ask Old Forrest to have a warehouse at the port. If so, take someone to see Look, try to search carefully. You, Savi and I go directly to the villa of Fles, he is best there!", Du Lin patted the hand on his neckline, slightly smiled and bypassed Dove walked out the door. "Take everything together. I don't want to have any accidents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Old Forrest is in himself. In the villa, he looks a little awkward now, and there are still a few yellow dirt on the neckline of the white shirt. The old face is extraordinarily dim. Hair is smashing. He sat back on a chair, his arms pressed against the back of the chair, not far from him, the couple, and he looked at them for almost five or six minutes, without saying a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler directs some of the next person to cover the entire floor with a piece of waterproof canvas. This is the gardener’s warehouse, about seventy or eighty square meters, on the wall. A variety of props for gardening can be seen in the grid. For example, iron wire, twisted iron pieces, pliers used to pruning branches, and some shovel and hoes of different sizes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the canvas on the ground, Alfredo took out a cigarette and took a breath, "My son died." "He looks like he is looking at the couple, but he doesn't have a clear focal length in his eyes. I don't know who he is saying to him, or is he talking to himself?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actually, I know, I knew very early that he could not be a good successor in the future. When he was young, we loved him too much, no matter what he wanted. We will all meet him, I still remember the day when he was 13th birthday, he told me how shocked and angry I was when I wanted a woman, even though we were all laughing at that time. From that moment on, I I know that he is a waste, a waste that only eats, drinks, and plays."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is like what I know to him, that all precious time is used In the wine and the woman, I don't blame him. My indulgence caused him his character, all this is my fault. Sometimes I will marry him, I have beaten him twice in the past few years, I I used to expect to be able to reverse his life, but I failed. I am desperate, I think I am a great person, but who can think that I actually have such a son?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took another sip of smoke, his eyes gradually gathered on the husband and wife, and his fists gradually tightened. "No matter how no use he is, no matter how waste, it is my son, my son!" Fuller stood up fiercely and picked up the chair and squatted on the floor. He used a lot of force, and some cyan rolling lines were bulging on his forehead, and the chair was scattered after a whining sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kicked the chair off the shelf, walked back and forth, panting, his hands waving without rules, his voice became even more Sorghum, full of boundless anger, "That is my son, only I can beat him, marry him, no one can make unreasonable things to him, but you...", he strode to the bes Kneeling in front of the couple on two chairs, pointing at them roaring, "But you killed him. Without my permission, you took away my most important family in the world, the most beloved treasure! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are damn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the old Flemish face Twisted and horrible, the woman bit her lip and her eyes flashed with tears. The man was still relatively calm, he shook his head, but said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Fuller’s chest was violently undulating. After a moment he unexpectedly calmed his anger, his hands gathered and scattered his hair on his side. Closed his eyes with his head up. For a while, he recovered his normal state. He smashed the cigarette head that had fallen on the canvas. The cigarette butt that was about to be extinguished became bright again under the influence of the airflow. He took another step and poked the cigarette butt. On the man's forehead, "What are you shaking? Well? What are you shaking? Do you think I am ridiculous? Or do you feel that you have done a great thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The man's face suddenly turned white, his eyes were filled with hatred and looked at the old Fowlers, not because he was suffering now, but he remembered his lovely daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Fuller took back his hand and took a frightened dress. "You killed my son for three thousand...you said, I should take you." What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the man spoke. "Your son is worth at least 3,000, but my daughter is worth only two thousand. Mr. Leth, your son is enough for him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you admit it?", Old Forrest actually laughed. "I know it is you." Hey, he confessed!", he twisted his head and looked at the housekeeper standing on the side with a look of surprise. "What do I say, it must be they!", he strode to the various Before the grid of tools, I found a pair of scissors used to build the branches. I walked back and shook my head and said, "No, you can't do it. You can't afford a truck, you can't afford a murderer. Who is helping you? Say his name, I will give you a good time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
