			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has been very careful to talk to Magus, the old man who has been immersed in politics for a lifetime, his wisdom, especially political wisdom, is really It is hard to guess. Just as he had just sat down, Magus told him that the reason why the matter subsided so quickly was because Magus had shot him. He pressed the matter down and protected him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s first reaction at the time was to breathe a sigh of relief. It is reasonable to say that people who are in the status of Maggs will not There are too many false things, not to say no, but absolutely no more than half are false. Maybe Du Lin solved the trouble in one way. Magus also helped solve some troubles, but he was all overwhelmed by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when Doolin was ready to thank Magus for his deep friendship, he suddenly had a problem in his mind if he thanked Mag. S, does that mean that he admitted in front of Magus that he is indeed the main "criminal" of the Nano Lindes attack? This is not impossible. Once he really follows the script of Magus, it is tantamount to sitting on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus doesn’t even need evidence and witnesses, just relying on his status and prestige in the empire, when people choose to be Doolin or Magus When you lie, you will be on the side of Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the vast majority of people, an empire’s prime minister does not lie in the face of the public, nor can it fall into a way that harms his own credibility. Young guerts, then must be lying with Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So his mouth opened, but it was another sentence, a word that did not recognize it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dulin’s guess, he did not admit that Magus would not make up the facts that Du Lin admits, because he is a prime minister, a nobleman, The leader of the new party. His dignity and personality did not allow him to do this kind of work, even if they knew each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next conversation, Du Lin, has been careful to watch out if Magus’s words still contain traps and the like, he uses as much as possible. It seems pretty sure, but in fact it is a vague way to avoid problems that he can't tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggs also noticed this. How did Du Lin perform? He only felt it in four sentences. Since Du Lin is guarding himself, there is no need for Magus to say what he should not have. The two said for a while, Magus sat in the chair and took a sip of tea. "Do you have anything in the afternoon?" Du Lin shook his head. He came to see Magus. "You should be everywhere." Turn around and see if you can move some of the Imperial Capital to Otis. You built it very well, and the Imperial Parliament submitted a bill. We plan to set up another three special zones..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is telling Doolin, you can get out of the way, Du Lin also got up and said goodbye to leave, watching him go a long way, sitting on the other side of the corner of a guy to go Come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man has a rigid face, and even the wrinkles on his face seem to be carved out. He wears very decent clothes, and there is no bells and whistles. The thing at a glance can make people see that he has a very special temperament and noble temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat in the chair that Du Lin was sitting on, his expression was calm, but he gave him a very serious feeling. "He looks really good." Slick, a few problems are very evasive, people can't pick anything wrong. But this kind of person is also difficult to control, he has too many ideas, you are sure that he can do what you want to do?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bal!", Magus sighed with a sigh of relief, one of his hands pressed on the book, subconsciously touching the foreskin of the book leather. "Our time is running out. I am old. You are old. We can't watch this empire for a lifetime. We always need to pick out a capable person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You still can't understand it after so many years? When a politician is old, his only value is to be defeated by young politicians and suddenly withdraw from politics. This is not a failure, but a great one. Inheritance, the only way to ensure that each generation of senior management has outstanding ability and vision, even if it is impossible to open At the same time, the soil can at least keep the current situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin is a very thoughtful person, from the case of Old John It is very important for him to treat these capitalists. This is exactly what we need most now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar is a bit surprised, "You really think he Can you be the behead of the heart of the capital?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!", Magus laughed very mysteriously. "It's the one that broke into the lower back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Magus himself is very clear, Capital power has expanded to the point where no one can balance it, except for greater capital power. This is a very dangerous infinite loop. From the day you open the dog cage, they are destined to always be able to stand passively. It is not the age of feudal ignorance hundreds of years ago. With the words of the royal family, it is possible to let the nobles of various territories suppress the merchants who have done bad things on their own territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now is an era of freedom, if the level of violence is used to promote this, as in the past, the whole world will look at the jokes of the empire, followed by It is the war in the financial sector and the riots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of capital can only be induced, only restricted, but there is no way to remove it forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar also laughed, and he tweeted: "You are not afraid that you have the wrong place in the dagger? When there was more than one time in history, when someone played daggers It hurts yourself, that is the most terrible thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very relieved that Du Lin is an unruly child, he is always ruthless. Leave a lot of troublesome things, as long as he messes up, you can send him directly on the road!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if you have heard of a sentence he said I think it makes sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the law, everyone is equal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Doolin returned to Otis, Dove told him that he had called him three times in the past two days. Every time he picked it up, he hung up for a while, then he called again, and he would dial three times in a row, but in one sentence. Did not say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sent Duff and closed the door of the office, dialed a federal number, and dialed the phone after a while, but there No one is talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Doolin, just coming back from the emperor, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop After a moment, a snoring sound sounded. "The scorpion named Lapuan came to contact Line 3 again. He seemed to be very interested in the life experience of Line 3, and they also drank wine together at night. Don't you interfere?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lapuan? Let people check what this person is. You just have to keep an eye on him. You can try to arrange an action to see if there is anything we need in his wallet.", Du Lin When I finished talking, I hung up. He knew that the identity of the caller was very special. He couldn’t talk for a long time, and there was no unhappy place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite is that he is very interested in this person called Lapuan, no doubt the other party is definitely chasing the gold robbery. Except for the bit of gold that Du Lin took out at the beginning, the latter is no longer a problem. He left almost 17 million gold in the treasury of the Imperial Bank. Most of the gold sold in jewelry stores now comes from the mining area in the western part of the empire, and the formalities are completely legal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one person who has traced this line, that is, Amp, but Amp is dead, who is this blind man, is it Amp? Heir? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Mr. Lapuan and Mr. Tucks stepped back from the bar and greeted Mr. Lapuan’s omnipotence. Next, Mr. Tucks has regarded him as a good friend. When returning home, Mr. Tucks' wife was not at home. Mr. Tucks himself said that she couldn't stand the fast-cooling weather and had gone to the South with her girlfriends for the summer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every year in the winter, the cold current from the north will sweep everything, quickly lowering the temperature to the extent that people must wear cotton. This is not a good season for some girls and women who have a good family. They are more inclined to the South without wearing a lot of clothes. Plus in the federal, high-level workers at this level will have a long annual vacation, and now is a good time for them to go on holiday in the South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn’t take long for Mr. Tucks to poke on the bed and squat on the bed, and Amp, who was already “sleeping”, squinted and sat down. When I got up, I was completely out of my mind. The socks he wore stood up without a whisper, and walked to the door in a limping position, gently pulling the door of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a very purposeful touch on the first floor of the study, using a set of unlocking tools that are said to be a very famous thief in the underground world. It is easy to open the door of the study. He didn't turn on the light. After closing the door, he took out a small thing that looked like a stinger from his pocket. He twisted the switch and the beam instantly shot from the lens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
