			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each shaped gang will have its own specialist doctor. These doctors will help gang members deal with types that are less convenient to heal in the hospital. Moreover, there are 20 or 30 people with fewer gangs, and more than one or two hundred people. There are always a few fevers and fevers. It is almost a standard for a gang to form a doctor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this part of the city of Tern, colds and fever are the most common conditions. Poor people can't afford the high-quality filtered water from the waterworks, and can only use well water as a daily water supply. Well water, this thing says it's clean, it's not so dirty. Say it's not clean, it's a bit dirty. And not everyone will boil the water and drink it again, especially some younger guys, who directly point their mouths at the faucet of the wellhead pump, and the people behind them shake and open their mouths to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So fever, colds and the like are really common. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the treatment of a private doctor, the wound on Wood has been stitched, but fortunately he was completely comated while lying in bed, feeling no pain Otherwise, I really can't say how long it will take to stitch all the wounds together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tnel City is not without anesthetics, but the side effects of anesthetics are very large. The main component of anesthetics comes from a mushroom that can cause hallucinations. This kind of mushroom was once everywhere, and many people had some terrible symptoms after eating. When the mushroom matures, it forms a vaguely visible face on the mushroom's umbrella surface, so people call it a ghost face mushroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the High Court of the Holy High Court have said that this "ghost-faced mushroom" is the seed of the devil that falls on the human world. Loss of reason, into the arms of the devil. In addition, the use of Ghost Face Mushrooms did cause some losses. Under the dual requirements of theocracy and the Empire, the entire Yaoxing Empire began the mighty action of “destroying the devil”. People have uprooted the grimace mushrooms and burned them into the fire. After the revision of the theocracy and the imperial law, they have the same provisions - prohibiting individuals from cultivating, eating, and selling ghost-faced mushrooms, or they will be severely punished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grimace mushroom that used to be everywhere seems to be disappearing, but it is not. The Imperial Academy’s research on Ghost Face Mushrooms has not stopped. It has been found through experiments that in addition to the slight illusion of ingestion of a small amount of ingredients, there is a very special role, that is, “rejection of pain” . To put it simply, there is a special substance that blocks the transmission of pain signals between neurons, even if it is broken, it does not cause any pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This discovery completely changed the "dizziness treatment", and the anesthetic that was raised and produced by the official cultivation began to be tested in the major hospitals of the empire in a limited way. The effect was very good, even if the patient's stomach was dissected, the lesion was taken out. The organs are re-stitched and the patients are able to stay awake throughout the procedure and feel no discomfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the use of anesthetics is also very strict, requires application and is provided by the metrologist and the surgeon who presides the operation, and then by the members of the Sensitive Materials Committee Approved before being approved. This process does not take much time and can be completed in about thirty minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all the houses built for shelter from the wind and rain, there will always be leaks, sometimes there are anesthetics with strict approval procedures, and there are also time. For example, when Codor is here, there are two possessions. These two are used in response to an emergency. It is obvious that Wood is not one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Gotall woke up Wood, his first reaction was to tighten his body, his face pale and pale. The intense pain made him have the urge to grab the ground and stun himself. When the violent pain lasted for a while, he tightened his teeth and relaxed a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that the pain has subsided or disappeared, but that he has gradually got used to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could this be done?", Godor stood against the wall, playing with the latest windproof lighter from Orodo. A look at the look of a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood sat up on the bed, and he endured severe pain throughout the process, but he felt that the pain in his body was far from the pain in his heart. Make him crazy. His eyebrows were almost erected, and he said with a grin: "It’s all Dulin’s guy, I’m too young to slap him, maybe his goal at the beginning was me...”, he said, he smoked A cold breath, the wound that was tightly held by the thread, was somewhat deformed as he sat up, and the blood immediately spilled from the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he also brought him a more painful pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a breath and his mood was slightly stabilized. He continued: "I want that guy to die in front of me and kill in the most cruel way." Die him, I don't ask the process, you open a price!", Wood is wise not to use friendship and friendship as a bargaining chip to help him to help him, he also understands that the more ambitious people, the business and The attitude of private affairs is more independent and clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a private matter, so he will not use such an excuse to open the road directly with the gold dollar. This is the best thing to use, no one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon smiled and asked: "How much do you think Doolin is worth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Wood gave a problem to Gothor, and also Córd gave Wood a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a question that will never be answered. It’s less, and Codor may not be willing to help him, and he will not continue to help because of Wood’s price increase. he. This is a matter of principle. Even if nothing is mentioned, Wood has set a price and Codor has helped him. In the eyes of outsiders, money is not the key thing, the friendship is, and Chowdor is helping Wood by his friendship with Wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he refused for the first time and agreed after Wood’s price increase, people would think that the reason why Córder helped Wood was not his friendship. He values, he only cares about money, and he can change his original intention and principle at any time for money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is a very difficult question to answer, Wood suddenly tightened for a moment, and after a moment he wiped the sweat from his forehead and said: " Ten...no, 200,000!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200,000 is not all of Wood’s savings, and he has earned millions of dollars in the past decade. Some of them have been squandered by him, and some have been used to clear the relationship. His deposits at the Imperial Central Bank are almost the same as in the early 1100 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a bit of a pain to get Duoling’s ending in 20%, but he knows he has to do it. All the failures of today have been printed in the minds of some people who may have begun to hide in the shadows and sharpen their teeth to prepare for his heart. So he must retaliate in a more insane way, let those who are ready to divide him think about it, whether or not to risk the collapse of a tooth, to lick this bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200,000 is enough for Codor to come up with all the energy to deal with it, now Wood needs time, in the shortest possible time, thoroughly In order to settle Dulin, he has the opportunity to continue to live in the city in a certain identity. Otherwise, he is likely to take his money, his family, and go to hell together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
