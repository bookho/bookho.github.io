			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. George sat up straight after he finished his speech. He looked at Doolin and Du Lin also nod his head. "Mr. George said that part of what happened now, I have a gossip. In fact, most of the over-the-counter transactions are authorized by the West Mine." When this sentence comes out, the faces of those who can still sit quietly have changed somewhat. expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called out-of-line transaction, in fact, is to circumvent the red line established by the West Mine to conduct offline transactions, where many people and some mine owners have such Relationships, after all, the fucking West Mine will maintain the superficial position in the West in order to obtain pricing power and ensure that they are on the surface of the pricing work to ensure the stability of the market. But the desire to pursue the interests is also the instinct that human beings have at birth, and even the law can't stop people from committing crimes, let alone an unofficial requirement of an association nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Mining Association is also very aware of this, once the price they set and the price of the market are very different, soon the mine owners will jump out against them, In the end, the West Mine will become an idle institution. So they have to let these miners taste some sweetness, for example... premium out-of-line transactions, the West Mine will guide the price is a unit of money, and the attention here is that the price is not high, but everyone buys Not enough. They will help these mine owners to match the demand side in a private price of five to two, so that they will price a piece of things, sell higher prices, and draw a group of mine owners to follow them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are some other means in it, but in the end, the West Mine will stand on its own heel, the mine owners are screaming and making money, everyone is happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is really unlucky? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a small miner who relies on the survival of the West Mine, as well as markets and buyers with huge demand outside the West. One can't sell the ore that he has worked hard to dig out, and one can buy the material he wants at a normal price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the West Mine will have to finish, and this is what Du Lin conveys to everyone. When he said this and was heard in the ears, some doubts that had been more or less plaguing them disappeared, replaced by silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is normal. If the West Mine wants to maintain its position, it will inevitably draw a group of mine owners to suppress a group of mine owners, but these people are here. It is not a good thing, because they are excluded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People will have a very wonderful emotional state. When others are victims, most people will stay out of the way. There will even be a slightly distorted idea that you don’t do wrong, others will harm you. Not pitiful, it must be what he did wrong, so others will hurt him. But when people find themselves to be victims... This is the fault of others. This is the fault of the world. Only I am innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?", someone asked Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Mining is not a free front, the military will let the soldiers educate the Freedom Front how to live in this country correctly, but no one will come Education Western Mining Association, telling them that it is time to disband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled lightly. "This is very simple, ladies and gentlemen. How does the West Mine maintain their status in the West? How do we kill them?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They benefit some people, then we will draw people who are not only not benefiting but may have suffered losses, then pull them over I know that you may ask how to get together, just like the West Mine will do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We give them a reasonable price, along with the market price Fluctuating prices, then eating all their ore and ingots, including building materials. No matter how many of them, we eat. I know you might think, maybe there is something I can't use, or these The mine's output exceeds our ability to buy. But it doesn't matter, because there are many companies outside the west who are willing to import ore from abroad and are not willing to deal with the West Mine."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These people Will become our ultimate partner. We will sell things to them at normal market prices, saving transportation costs and releasing more profit margins. I believe this is not a difficult business, this is a Let us know more about the sale of friends. When this part of the mine owner is on our side, the rest of the people need to face a choice, choose us with more strength, or continue to ride the ship that is about to be silent. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The West Mining Association has four executives who died in accidents or assassinations, which means they lost half of their sales channels, and half of them are in the West Mine." Mine owners who acquiesce to offline transactions will lose space, but we can provide them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling stretched out a palm of his hand and held it open, "Supply...", then extended another hand, "demand side...", then his two hands were closed together, ten fingers interlocked Close up formed a huge fist, "power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other people in the room began to fall into thinking, thinking about this method that Du Lin said It doesn't work. In fact, when Du Lin said it, they knew that this method was highly feasible because of its strength. If these people here can unite, the West Mine will not be their opponent at all. They have more partners and more allies outside the West. This is a huge market. The reason why they didn't work before was that no one stood up and united them. There wasn't a strong guy who allowed them to temporarily put down their prejudice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone knows that the root cause of the turmoil in the West is in this house, sitting between them - Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was still very calm before he came to the west, but look at what happened after he came, the west is like being thrown into A fish pond with poison, all the fish are struggling wildly. But it is also because Du Lin has such strength, so they can sit in this room today and let go of the commercial competition between them, and start thinking about cooperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His approach actually has a simpler saying, that is, bullying people, using more strength to bully people, this is also the capital game field, often made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than ten minutes to twenty minutes of silence, there was a constant raise of hands to recognize Du Lin’s statement, when the last person raised his hand, Du Lin Facing Federer in the corner, he hooked his finger and said to everyone, "This Mr. Federer used to be the most loyal fan of the West Mine, but today he will also be the first to stand up against the West Mine. Warriors.", he said, looking at Federer with his face on his face. "Mr. Federer, are you saying yes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federer is in a complicated mood, but he is still low. Head, "Yes...this is the case." His mood yesterday morning was as sunny as the weather in the west, but when he heard that two other people who did not repay Du Lin the day before yesterday had a car accident, one was robbed and After interrupting a leg, he felt fear surrounding him. He also remembered the little finger of the friend who didn't even have a name behind him, which is bound to appear in the future. There is no doubt that Du Lingan must be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling nodded. "Can you give us some space?" In the popular words, you can roll back. Mr. Federer immediately smiled and greeted him, and returned to his corner to stand like a background board. Do not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, I am talking about another question, maybe you will feel some surprise, but this is the fact. This problem is the Kadima Party." After Du Lin said He took out a cigarette and he could see that these people started to communicate with their eyes and overreacted to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not something beyond what he expected. The tenant can implement the three guarantee policies in the west and can get a lot of support. These big capitalists are not contributing. less. This is why Maggs is very vigilant about capitalists and capital forces. Nowadays capitalists are engaged in one thing. First, they will corrode an official with sufficient status to support their behavior, and then seek policy inclination. This has become a standard process similar to unspoken rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the west, capitalists do not need to buy a farmer, the doormen will take the initiative to join them, which makes many capitalists such as the Bondika Military Group Mr. Carlos is very comfortable. Regardless of the project to be carried out by the company, will it pose danger to the surrounding residential areas, whether it will cause terrible damage to the western environment, and whether it will change the fate of some people, it is not important. Because the doormen will nod, the state government will pass, and the projects they can't establish elsewhere can work here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman is a very easy to use wrench, or a versatile one. Now Du Lin said that the door farmers are the cause of the turmoil in the west. They subconsciously think that Doolin wants to take out the doormen, but they have invested a lot of things in the doormen and kicked the doormen, which will cause them to lose. And more importantly, if you remove the Mennon and the Kadima Party, who is the next successor, will you be as good-minded as the Mennon, and willing to actively compromise some principles for the flourishing of the great capital business? problem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is full of uncertainty, once the successor is a character like Magus, it is a devastating thing for all capitalists in the West. result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin’s cigarettes were about to burn out, Bondika asked: “Why is the doorman one of the roots of chaos in the West? Mr. Du Lin "Do you have any basis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to?", Du Lin took the last cigarette and smashed the cigarette butt in the ashtray. "Of course there are Otherwise, I will not make such a judgment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
