			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Mennon, do you know? Just now, a western mine owner named Federer explained how he passed the West Mine and yours. Operating the process of tax evasion, I really can't imagine a government official who is very prestigious in the West can do this kind of thing, even taking the initiative to merge with some capitalists to harm the interests of the empire. Your behavior makes me feel very good. It’s shameful.” The people in the Western Military District sat across from the farmer’s face. He had a meeting record from the scene and handed it to the doorman. “Perhaps you will want to talk about it now, about the turmoil in the west. And the combination of these criminals’ tax evasion and tax evasion has ruined the interests of the country.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he shrugged, “The content of this allegation is no longer manufactured. The terrorist attack is to harm the national interest. Mr. Mennon, it seems that you have a big problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman picked up from the table with no expression The minutes of the meeting, he looked cold and looked up. Each line every word did not miss. He looked very slow, and he was very attentive. The person sitting across from him did not urge him. Instead, his hands were on his chest. He stared at the doorman quite interestingly. Looking at his reaction, he wanted to know if the doorman would Will be angry or trembled, or because the crime is revealed and feared. This is a different person from ordinary criminals. He is a leader of a party. The politician, who is now the most prestigious in the West, will he be as weak as the ordinary people in the face of the inexorable evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the peasant’s gaze fell on the full stop of the last sentence of the last meeting record, he took a sigh of relief and placed the meeting minutes on the table. Then, then look at the opposite agent with a blank expression. "Let the person with the highest authority here come. I don't want to spend time with a young man who can't do anything. If you think these things can make me how." Then I can only say that you are too naive." After he finished, he shook his head and closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young agent’s face was so unusually bright, he was stunned, but he was not the first to see it. The more powerful the big man is, the more willing he is to talk to someone who can be the master. In their words, this is not a concession, a compromise, a two-sided transaction. They pleaded guilty to some of the less serious crimes, confessed some of the conspirators, and then got some convenience. After experiencing some punishments that had little impact, they continued to be a big man of the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t like this kind of person including the way they behave, but the nature of the empire determines that something cannot be done in accordance with people’s most realistic ideas. Ugly things will inevitably exist, and these are to highlight the ultimate beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, I will inform the superiors now." The young man stood up and walked out of the door with some emotion. Just as he was about to disappear from the sight of Mennon, his footsteps paused and he seemed to want to say something. But in the end nothing was said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Amman walked into the room alone because of the colonel. His face was a little embarrassed. He felt that he had taken a big step from the threshold of Major General. I didn't expect that the time of a few days reversed and it became a big step back. Some of his competitors are afraid that they will soon be laughing, and they will finally get some benefits to win this task. Suddenly they will become a high-level diving in a water pool with a depth of only 10 cm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment when I entered the surface of the water, I almost blew my head and I dyed my own sludge. If only the ordinary task fails, it may be because of the command problem, perhaps because of other problems. But he succeeded, successfully holding a bomb and then heading down and down, this success is more terrible than failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the military, there are three things that can’t be contaminated as an officer. Once you’ve been caught up in this life, it’s estimated that you’ll be finished. The first thing is to change the knot. The straightforward point is betrayal. This is a restricted area for soldiers. Whoever enters and die, unless you want to pull a team to do it yourself, the new club will not trust an apostate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing is the massacre. An officer directs a battle for whatever reason. As long as the battle is characterized as a massacre, then all the merits are in one Instantly becomes a fatal mistake. No matter whether emotionally or morally, people will not trust a commander and create a slaughtering officer. This is a matter of character and morality. Even if the commanding skills are exceptionally excellent, they cannot stop people from being disgusted with him. alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold-blooded butcher will not have a good end, this is a well-known thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third thing is to use your position to seek benefits for yourself, or to transfer benefits to an organization. The federal aggressors in the Civil War have made people aware of the necessary purity of the military. An army that is not pure enough has no fighting power at all. This is why the Southern Military Region is reviled because they were not pure enough at the time. During the decadent feudal empire, the Southern Military Region and many aristocrats had very close contacts. After the war, the main reason for the rapid deterioration of the situation in the war was on the issue of ****. According to the public to find a reason, but it does exist, just after the cabinet was formed, in order to gather the power in the hands of the generals, as well as military reforms, incited public opinion on the pure issue of the military. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colonel Mann is now facing the slaughter of one of the three major troubles. In some reports he has become a devil wearing a human skin. The words of ruthlessness and cruelty seem to be inseparable from his description. Some of the major military figures in the Ministry of Defense also expressed dissatisfaction with the use of the No. 2 gas-burning projectile to make a massacre. In fact, the last dissatisfaction was made by the public relations figures from the Bondika Military Group. The newspaper reported that after the massacre in the valley, the spearhead pointed to the cold and cruel slaughter of Colonel Mann, and also pointed to the poison gas produced by the Bondika Military Group. The smoke bomb lost its humanitarianism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to save their face as soon as possible, the Bundika military group, in addition to conducting research on public opinion, let all the people understand that the poison of the No. 2 incendiary bomb comes from The burning of chemical combustion-supporting substances was not their intention to join, but also the responsibility was given to Colonel Mann. According to the public relations department of the Bondika Military Group, the No. 2 incendiary bomb is mainly used for exporting to the warring countries. Although it has not been stated in the instrument to prohibit domestic use, there has been some communication with the Imperial Army. This type of ammunition can only be used to defend the sovereignty of the empire and against the invaders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Defense also made some observations through unofficial channels. They believe that most of the constituents of the Freedom Front are from abroad and have certain attacks. Sex and danger, Colonel Mann did have some mistakes in choosing tactics to select ammunition, but this is not his main problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that behind this incident, the Bondika Military Group has given the Ministry of Defense a 10% discount on orders for next year. As for whether it is true or not No one can be sure. After all, this secret thing, who dares to say that he knows, can't see the sunshine of the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the interference of many factors, Colonel Mann lost a lot of hair overnight, and the only thing that can make him a little comfortable is the Imperial Military Court and The Imperial Gendarmerie General Command did not send him any news to dismiss him or to try him. Although he has carried some nicknames, he may not be able to find a breakthrough opportunity by taking the deeds of some people in the future. He has been comforting himself for so many days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, he is very annoyed now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irritated person often can't control his emotions very well. When he enters the room, he sits opposite the doorman, and his face shows a kind of no An impatient expression, reaching out to the desktop and making a squeaky voice, "What do you want to say? I am sorry, I have a lot of recent things. If there is nothing I am interested in, I can't listen to you frequently. Say something that I don't like." He is warning the doorman, if the doorman can't get a substantial trading condition, he won't come back in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
