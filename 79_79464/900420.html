			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of Doolin’s promotion of identity cards is to give the residents of Otis a class superiority. I am the “citizen” of the city. When all locals and those who are willing to settle here begin to taste this sweet taste, they become vested interests – exploiting from outsiders on a city-by-city basis and providing them with benefits, only This way they will become Doolin's most iron hardcore supporters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it will unswervingly maintain the rules of the game developed by Doolin, no matter who is the mayor, will not let him change this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to be able to guarantee Du Lin’s interests here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that he bought more than 60% of the land in the city plan ahead of time, this is a super investment that will increase in value! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is busy, and the rest of the city hall is not idle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagson watched Du Lin leave the city hall at the window, only to clean up some scattered documents on the table, check his dress, hands Slowly left his office in his pocket. If his actions are seen by his elders, there must be no reprimands. There is no aristocratic appearance, but he likes it very much. Instead of leaving the town hall directly, he went to find Donald. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Donald belong to the "transfer students". For the city and the town hall building, they are all outsiders, so natural will Produce a feeling of "two are a group." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he pushed the door of Donald’s office, Donald was still watching the policy and philosophy of Doolin’s coming to Otis. Donald is not a arrogant person. He knows that he can become a member of a city at the age of 33, not because of his efforts, but because of the people behind him. He still has a little trouble. The trouble is that the person behind him and the resources of that person have been completely used up at the moment he became a member of Parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some resources are renewable resources, but political resources are clearly not listed here, and no one can help him in the next road, only by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew that this opportunity was hard to come by, so he hoped to learn more things. Even though Du Lin was 13 years younger than him, he did not despise Du Lin's mentality. He knows that he is still far behind, compared to Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bangbangbang’s knocking on the door made him look back from the book. He looked up and looked at Hargerson leaning against the door. It took a few seconds to get back to the Qingming, "Is there something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagson is not at all politely walking into Donald's office and looking at the office and his office. The difference is also said: "After work, buddy, drink some wine together at night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donald noticed the passage of time at this time, he looked up and saw At first glance, he patted his forehead. "Time flies too fast..." He sighed. He couldn't understand many things in the copy of the afternoon, which made him feel his own shortcomings. It’s really exhausting and mentally exhausted these days, and it’s a good idea to relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately agreed to the invitation of Hargerson, whether he or Hagerson, was a nobleman. It is because their status and status are much higher than others, so they know better than others that the New Party and the Old Party did not have the same atmosphere as the enemy of life and death. Some of the old party’s high-ranking family members are also members of the New Party, and the brothers of Magus’s wife are still members of the old party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald tidy up the table and close the door of the office, and the two left the town hall building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I come to work every day, I see those huge pillars that give me a very depressed feeling.", standing outside the town hall, Donald Endurance I can't help but tell the feelings in my heart. The pillars that need five or six people have a very exaggerated visual impact. They stand in the pillars, and they always feel unconsciously from the past. Small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you should go to the temple behind the Parliament Hill to have a look!", Hagson did not directly comment on his statement, but raised Another comment, "When you see the temple on the Parliament Hill, you will feel that it is exactly the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Pope ruled the world, The church built a total of twelve temples, all of which were on the winding hills. They believed that the closer to the sky, the closer they were to the gods. Later, for various reasons, the church finally fell, and some temples were destroyed by angry kings, but some were left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the temples on the foothills of the Parliament Hill is 2,133 meters from the ground, a lone peak, and the entire building is as simple as unfinished. There are no colorful stained glass, no various story carving walls, and no statues. The entire temple has only one huge dome, and then it is supported by twelve huge pillars without walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a brazier in the middle of the temple, which is not extinguished all the year round - every day a priest climbs up to add oil to the brazier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two chatted and found a bar, a newly opened bar, not far away. Because this is a special administrative area, because there are laws that are self-developed, so many things that are illegal in other areas or between illegal and non-illegal, there is plenty of room for survival here. This is already the third bar opened this week. It is very popular and there are more than 20 young people waiting in line at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagson and Donald went directly to the VIP channel, for which they needed to redeem no less than two hundred tokens. In Otis, the bar's tokens seem to have become a trend, and all the bars that have already opened are using this token. The token is divided into five grades, one, five, twenty, one hundred and five hundred. They look like a magnified coin, a pure copper base with a circle of silver on the edge, five Hundreds of tokens are inlaid with gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of the token is the new town hall of Otis, with a few lines of numbers and letters on the back and a symbol of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This token can be consumed at any bar, but not for cash or for change. This makes many people feel strange, but considering that this is likely to be the "feature" of the city of Otis, everyone gradually accepted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagson wants twenty tokens, he changed two hundred, enough for their consumption this evening, and probably more Part of it. These tokens can be taken away, so he is not worried that the flowers will be wasted, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decoration of the bar is very avant-garde, the girls are also very beautiful, and look They are very hot when they go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two cups of ice and snow world.", Hageson has already had a bar, he directly ordered a blending wine that could not be used anywhere else. There are several colors and flavors that he likes very much. They found a position that was slightly sideways and sat down. After asking for drinks, he asked: "What do you think of it?", adding that he added, "I mean the city."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald thought about it. "I don't know how to describe it. In general, there is not much difference with other places, but there are many changes in the details. For example..." His eyes are on the side of the bar. Young people with alcohol, "There can be a strong sale of spirits here, and there is no contraband investigation bureau. Some things that can't be bought elsewhere can be sold here in a big way."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that Hargerson also feels. In other places, if you want to get a little grimace mushroom, it is like being guilty. You need him to go to the dirty alley and those who look at it are not what Good people in the street mix trade, but also use the whisper. Occasionally, patrol cars passed by, and those guys disappeared into the darkness instantly, and it was harder to find them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here... as long as you have money, you can buy everything that this empire has! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl with a very strange open helmet came over, she was wearing very cool clothes, and two cups were placed on the tray in her hand. Special blending wine. The cup is a circle and the first layer is silvery white, and it hangs down the wall, like the inverted mountain peak. Under the first layer is dark blue, then light blue, and finally Pink and flaming red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl put two glasses of wine on the table, and Hagson lost twenty dollars to the girl, the girl said with a sweet smile. After a thank you, turn and leave. Haggson’s gaze stayed on the girl for a while before he received it. He took a glass of wine and touched Donald and took a sip. "It's like a bloody mouth, swallowing countless money, never spit it out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;?&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he had a sigh of relief, and there was a slight change in his eyes. The difference in origin meant that he observed the world in terms of angle and height. He immediately realized why it was a special zone, why would there be Such a thing. His gaze quickly fell on the tumbling tokens in his hands. He had a faint thought that he was unwilling to admit and would not continue to think, which made him feel that he could not say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he held an ordinary ice cream in his hand and saw someone holding a bowl of ice cream, he had already passed through the mother, but now he saw an iceberg. An iceberg made of ice cream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drafting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
