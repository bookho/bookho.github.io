			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get up?", Kelly smiled and sat on the bed and kissed Seaman's forehead, and took the initiative to bring clothes for Seaman. While helping Ximan to wear her clothes, she asked casually: "Does your brother bring the money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Himan was a little handsome His face was completely ruined after wearing his eyes. He nodded. The hollow air made him feel a little uncomfortable. He grabbed half a piece of bread at the bed and replied: "Must, I have seen my brother. There are at least 200,000 bank accounts, and we don’t want all of them. He will give them.” He said that Ximan had smashed a small piece of bread into his mouth and said vaguely: “He is very I care about me, so for my safety, he will definitely give it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered the kidnapping of his vacation when he went home to visit relatives, Graf I found them in the first place and ran those who kidnapped him. He knew that he and his mother were the closest relatives of Graf, and that money was really not much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Seaman did not tell the truth. When he checked the Graf bank account, he did not see 200,000, but more than 400,000. He did not Say the truth and have your own considerations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelly’s face suddenly smiled. She sat in Seaman’s arms and half of her cheeks clung to Seaman’s chest and whispered: What is your brother doing, how can he be so rich?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 200,000 for a girl like Kelly is an astronomical figure, she even The limit that comes to mind when dreaming is tens of thousands. She doesn't want this to be a one-time "transaction." If Seaman's brother is a businessman or something else, there is no problem with hanging this guy or even marrying him. The key is to have money and the ability to create money. Only in this way can we maintain the life she wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Himan did not know what Graf had done. In his heart, he actually looked down on Graf, the hard work of a station, no culture, ligatures. I don't know. As a self-accepting higher education, there is always a cultural person's faint disdain for illiteracy. But he knows that this kind of thing can't be said, even if he has a bit of annoying attitude when he communicates with Graf, he will not clearly show his contempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He?", Seaman snorted. "I don't know very well. Everyone has to have a little secret, maybe it is the money of Daphne, or It was given to him by someone else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelly is holding on to this problem. She has tried the pain brought about by poverty and is shocked by the fear of poverty. She does not deny that she is a girl who worships gold. What is wrong with pursuing the life she wants? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pressed one hand on Seaman’s chest and made herself closer to Seaman’s body, she could feel that Seaman’s breathing became a little short Some, "Are you not curious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Himan ate bread without answering this question, he is certainly curious, but as a cultural person's self-respect How can I not know the ligature, and my brother who has been engaged in the minimum work before asks him how to make money now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelly sees that Ximan does not say anything, and takes out a cigarette that is obviously hand-rolled out of the bedside table, and the technique is not very clever. The husband and the experienced people have a good look, they will add a little chili powder to refresh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the price of a handmade cigarette is enough to be awesome. In addition to the ordinary shredded tobacco, there are also hyphae of the happy land and the grimacing mushroom. It is only one foot long and two hairs, it is worth five dollars! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf guessed a bit wrong, Seaman was not hooked up by Kelly, but he was interested in Ghost Mushroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical effect of this kind of thing can not be rejected by many people. In fact, this thing is essentially a non-hazardous neuro-syringue, but It is used in one aspect, it is enough to make people addicted to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Seaman’s face in a smile, lying in bed, smirking from time to time, or suddenly becoming serious, talking embarrassing In the dialogue, she quietly closed the door and retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After walking through a corridor less than ten meters away, she entered another room, a young man with a red fruit on the top of the table and counting money. She walked over and pressed against the young man from the back. The young man leaned his head slightly and glanced at Kelly behind him and asked, "How did the money come out?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelly nodded. "He said that every month someone would give his brother a sum of money, about tens of thousands of pieces. Who is playing, why?" It’s not clear.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man put down a thick piece of two denominations in his hand, and there was a green light in his eyes. He licked his lips and there was a dangerous breath that flashed from him. "Every month has a few Ten thousand?", he whispered, originally thought it was just a rich student, did not expect to actually dig a gold mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man is called Daniel. He runs the casino and there are some girls in his hand who are helping him find money. The families of these girls are very difficult. He spends money to take them away from their original family and destiny, and to fund them to continue their education, and to let them enjoy the joy of money, and then he will give them a task. The content of the task is basically to find some rich people from the university, and then become friends with them, then bring them here to play a few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other party does not like to gamble, then there are contraband items such as grimace mushrooms that can be offered to them, as long as a few times is enough to bring a rich family son into the water and become A stable source of income. In this way, he can plunder more than 5,000 pieces of profits from these wealthy students every month! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniel has always felt that he is very smart, his mind is very aura, at least others can't think of this method. He also intends to expand his business, not only in Ordoto, but also in all developed cities throughout the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at this moment, he feels that there seems to be a simpler and better business waiting for himself. If you get the bank account number, does it mean that there will be enough money for him to spend his whole life in his hands? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was moved and gave birth to a terrible idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and pinched Kelly’s face. This is something he likes to do. He likes to watch the eyes of those beautiful girls. An expression that is resentful but does not dare to escape. He invested more than a thousand dollars in Kelly's body, not only to pay her tuition, to buy her a variety of cosmetics and clothing, but also to give her enough pocket money to let her go hunting. Although these girls have made up for his losses in other ways, he feels that it is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his own words, he gave them a new life, then they must earn enough rewards for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand caressed Kelly’s face, then her neck, and then went deep into the open-collar clothes... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good kind of fun activity, especially when a man inspires a certain kind of intense emotion, especially this kind of activity is needed to relieve his emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the two were studying the relationship between piston formation and kinetic energy, several uninvited guests came in on the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This casino is not for those who seem to be more powerful. Daniel is very aware of his own weight. He can’t afford those who have the strength, so he made A rule, his casino only accepts men brought by girls, and those who don't seem to have much money or are engaged in low-lying jobs. These two kinds of people are not dangerous to him. The former does not dare to open things up, and the latter does not have the guts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The janitor who is responsible for guarding the casino gate is also the door of Daniel’s fellow in time. He can see that these people are not ordinary people. As for why they can see this, they can be found from the dressing of these people. In order to allow girls to get high-quality "customers", Daniel often organizes new girls to learn, what kind of clothes, how much money, what kind of jewelry represents what it means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that Daniel himself is a master of tasting fashion, and even these men with him have a considerable understanding of these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of these people, it’s impossible to wear a whole set of dozens of pieces. No poor people will wear two or three months’ salary, even Some small gang members will not do this, so he must stop these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, this is private..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t say it, not him I didn't want to say it, but a person suddenly stuck in front of him, and a sharp sharp knife fell on his chest. He slowly raised his hands, and he didn't want to kill himself because he had misinterpreted the other party's mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open the door!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headed person gave a voice and he immediately knocked Iron Gate, said a door open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was pulled open, and a sweaty air spewed out of the door, and one of the pedestrians stepped in a few steps, then Together with the goalkeeper, they were brought in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
