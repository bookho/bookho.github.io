			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to stop?", the patrolman touched the pistol hanging on his waist, and the few people who had been run over by the entire team must not survive. The patrolmen who patrol the street like them know very well about the cars of these rich people. The people sitting inside have many times the money of others. The weight of the cars they ride is many times that of ordinary cars. So heavy, it’s still five, even if it’s not dead now, you’ll have to finish it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another patrolman shook his head, slightly with a hint of unclear faint hatred. "You are driving up now, believe it or not, not only the police car Hit, if you get off, they will kill you even if you guys. Didn’t you read the newspaper? Some of these rich people are treason, and the country dares to betray and kill a few civilian policemen?", Good Morning News The content reported is too shocking. What is more troublesome is that Majelli did not name his name when he wrote the manuscript. Instead, he expanded the small group of people who might be suspected of treason into almost all rich people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, for ordinary people in society, rich people are not good things, and the wealth they possess is obtained by betraying the country and harvesting civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s better to maintain order than this." The two policemen sorted out their instruments and turned the police lights on to open the sirens. The crowd that is boring and saving money has stood up. Finding the trouble of the rich is equal to finding your own troubles, but looking for the troubles of these ordinary people, find them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just left the city center, Mr. Sail received a call from the general commander responsible for the "catch" of Doolin, saying it was In the arrest, in fact, the order issued by Mr. Sail was to kill him immediately when he discovered Du Lin, and he could not let him live in front of the public. The value of the dead Doolin is far greater and safer than he is alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Mr. Sail didn’t think that Du Lin actually ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They dug a tunnel under the mantle’s cellar and left by railcar. We are cleaning up some of the tunnels destroyed by explosives. It’s not clear yet. Where is the place to leave." The commander is a lieutenant colonel. He is sweating at this time. It is obviously a simple matter. Now it is complicated. His voice is more and more hoarse. "Another action... ...we have a total of 63 casualties..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Sail has no sorrow and no sorrow, and his voice is very friendly. "To express my highest respect to all the casualties, pay attention to the pension, and hand over the money to the hands of these people or their families. What are their casualties? "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The body is not found at the moment, but there are many large pieces of blood on the ground, at least no less than ten people are killed, their bodies may be taken Going away." When it came to this, the lieutenant colonel felt that his face was bursting with heat. A group of professional soldiers attacked a manor, and the number of casualties was several times that of these non-professional soldiers. It was a shame, and his face was hot with a slap. He did not emphasize to Mr. Sail that most of the casualties originated from mines buried outside the manor. This is more of a stupid excuse. No manor owner has ever planted mines in his estate, even if he is a big man like Mr. Sail. meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they did not arrange for demining troops, and then they ate a big loss, and the two lightweight weapons-equipped platforms were also scrapped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Sail apparently did not expect the EFF to be inferior to Doolin’s private armed forces. He did not need to understand the advantages of both offense and defense in combat, he knew The EFF is just as good as the catering bucket. He did not ship the goods and continued to maintain his own demeanor. "I am sorry, this is a disappointing ending. Help me inform the Navy to block every departing vessel on the coastline until I find Du Lin." When he finished, he hanged up the phone. The waste actually let Du Lin run, and it also means that Du Lin had already started to plan for it a few years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailor picked up the FBI’s phone and said what he knew, let them find the people who worked for the manor, and then pursued the clues. Du Lin found out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned around after all the phone calls, facing a lot of face-to-face joint meeting speaker, showing a helpless expression, "Ladies and gentlemen, Du Lin ran!", he went back to his seat and sat down and said, "But the solution is still waiting for us..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In view of the current large-scale riots in various parts of the Federation, in accordance with the federal constitution, the terms of special periods (including but not limited to war) are automatically activated and the highest power is obtained. Then at 8 o'clock in the evening, the big speakers of each city began to read the decision of the joint parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From now on, the federal state enters a state of control, imposes a curfew, and does not allow anyone to wander around the street after seven o'clock in the evening. All acts that may be considered criminal, the infringed person has the right to kill these criminals without guilt. At the same time, the ten cities with the most turmoil in the federal government began to implement a rationing system that included food, water, electricity and everything related to people's lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
