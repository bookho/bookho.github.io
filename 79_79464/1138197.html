			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chap looked at the two agents who apparently came from the investigating agency and finally chose to respond with silence. After requesting to check the other party's documents, he took the initiative to leave with the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news that Chap was arrested was quickly passed back to Rani’s ear, which made him relieved, and Chap’s arrest means lucky luck casino The shady scene will be unveiled, and the Imperial Tax Administration, indeed, needs a special victory to start the reform process with a high profile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, Rani always felt that the investigation was a bit strange. The city of Otis has always been the site of Doolin, and now Magus is like this. The high-profile investigation of the tax evasion phenomenon in the casino side means that there is an invisible contradiction between him and Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It just happens that the contradiction erupted in this way at this time. Does it mean that the long-standing relationship between Magus and Doolin is going to break down? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most terrible thing in politics is not the downside in political struggle, but excessive interpretation and wrong guessing, even because of a small thing to think about. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rani quickly reminiscent of Chap, who was arrested, and he will eventually provide that all this is Du Lin’s behind the scenes, then before and Mag In the phone call, Magus said that to check whether it means that he will finally go to Du Lin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very painful, and there is a bit of uneasiness. The original delight has been turned into awkwardness, between Magus and Doolin. War, will not be implicated in yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that he has always been the first to see Maggs, obeying the orders of Magus, and he and Du Lin also have good personal relationships, in these years of tax law In the revision, there are some ideas that Du Lin provided for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case the two men really want to break out of the war... Rani does not dare to continue thinking, he feels that he will be trapped in a whirlpool and unable to extricate himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously this is for sure, because he is the specific case-handling person, and even he can imagine the formation of the special investigation team and the police investigation bureau. And the strength of the National Security Council, it is possible to deal with Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it in accordance with Magus’s request, or is it skipping Doolin, which may appear in the case? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lane suddenly became a bit frustrated, and Rani didn’t know, he thought too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, Chap has been escorted back to Otis to accept the interrogation of the investigation team. In the interrogation room, Rani looks at Chap. I sent some photos. "Can you explain the contents of these photos?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chap glanced and shook his head and closed his mouth. From the moment he was arrested, he did not say a word and did not convey any information through any form of expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Chap, you should understand that the empire will focus on tax reform for the next period of time, clean up the shortcomings of the past and find out who made the loopholes. This is an important step in the reform process. I am not afraid to disclose the words to you. Some people have to use their own experience to warn and shock people who have not yet been discovered. If you do not want to be the headline in the newspaper, I hope you Can cooperate with our work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rani put the photos together, he looked calmly at Chap, "You can choose to resist the investigation, then we Other places to find a complete chain of evidence will send you to the trial seat, but you can also actively cooperate with the investigation, we will pray for you on the judge's side, maybe you do not need to face daunting results!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chap looked at Rani and bowed his head and said nothing. In fact, he already knows the current situation. If he can get rid of most of his guilt, he will definitely speak. But the problem is that his real trouble is not that tax evasion is as simple as tax evasion. He is not afraid of trial from the law. What he fears is the trial from Doolin, who is a person who can really kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way now is to close your mouth, say nothing, admit nothing, and then wait for someone else to take him out...maybe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
