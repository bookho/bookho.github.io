			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Vivian, standing by the window on the third floor, watched Kevin’s car leave the gate of the Governor’s House, she put the curtain down and stretched it. Some of the body jumped up and fluttered on the soft bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone was tired during this time, Kevin, she and everyone else was tired. Not only physical fatigue, they need to collect evidence, they need to communicate with witnesses, and more tired is the inner feelings. It’s really not fun to be told by your loved ones. The disappointment, anger, sigh and many negative emotions are mixed and people are full of disappointment in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world seems to be gray, only money and power have their own colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, she came over, she wants to thank Du Lin, and also thanks to Kevin, who recommended a good good lawyer for her, and Kevin Helping her win the lawsuit and let her father leave her things without being taken away by her brothers. Although she had to pay Kevin two million to win the case, she felt that the account was still very cost-effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From now on, everything here is her own. At the same time, she realized that the other thing was going to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is the most fulfilling day she has ever lived. There is no such thing as Peter’s rhetoric. He is not considerate to be too intimate. He is like A living person, just there, can touch him, there is nothing false. So far, Buddha has not said to her "I love you", but she can feel that Buddha is worried about her, so that she did not return to Otis during this time, but stayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe tomorrow, after dawn, they will go their separate ways, one will continue to act as a feminist and pioneer, and dance on the political stage of Cannes . And the other guy, stay away from a distant place and live the life he is used to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this evening, it is separation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Weian has a bit of sadness, but she knows very well about this matter. Some people are naturally destined to be together and accept the blessings of God and friends. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also some people who may be separated at both ends of the world, but as long as the hearts are together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put on a set of clothes that she hadn’t worn for a while, because she felt that the dress was a bit shameful, but she didn’t know why her brain was hot. I bought it. Now she understands that this dress is meant to be worn at such a moment to witness the sacredness of this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bottle of fine wine adorns the pink enamel at night, all sitting on the sofa and looking at the latest tape, but thinking about how Vivienne wants to give himself Surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, this surprise seems to be unable to come, only to be scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harsh phone ringing sounded abruptly, and the almost perfect atmosphere in the room suddenly seemed to find a venting jet, and the Buddha frowned, he picked up The earpiece is placed in your ear. "Here is the Governor's Mansion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, does the Governor's House have a car with a license plate?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you?", that is Kevin’s driving vehicle. There are more than a dozen cars in the Governor’s Office. It seems to be old. Only two are new, all belong to Weiwei. Ann. This license plate number is one of them, and Kevin drove away not long ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, I am sorry, I am the patrolman of Orodo. I just had a car accident in the city center. The license plate number is the Governor's Office, so I am I would like to ask your opinion. Now the driver is stuck in the driver's seat and is already unconscious. We have two choices now. One is to cut off his leg and rescue him as soon as possible. Another way is to wait for the fire truck. Come over, they have equipment to open the deformed cab and pull the driver out of it, time is running out, so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You wait Stand still, don't leave, I will call you back in a minute.", Foshan dialed the phone and dialed Doolin's phone. Kevin is a friend of Doolin, and still a good friend, so this decision he made No, Vivienne can't do it, only Du Lin can make a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin gasped a little while receiving the call, and he heard that he seemed a little tired and was very short when he spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss, Kevin may have been targeted, he had a car accident, the police at the scene asked if he saw his leg and sent him to the hospital for rescue, or wait The fire station person pulled him out of the car completely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin woke up in the next moment. "Tell the police station to let the hospital send the rescue equipment to the scene. If it is not the last moment, don't cut off his leg, or let him wake up after he wakes up. Decided."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha conveyed Doolin’s advice to the police and told them that all costs and losses were borne by the Governor’s Office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, the hospital in Orodo has never encountered such a case, but in the vocation of "saving the wounded and dying", they still follow the requirements of the Buddha. Then, of course, there will be some extra transportation costs and equipment loss costs, and the Governor’s Office will not be reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, two trucks arrived at the scene in tandem, a large number of medical equipment were removed from the truck, and three emergency doctors began The rescue work on the spot. They first tested Kevin's blood type, then began transfusion, and checked the injuries he suffered in a car accident within a limited range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is not very optimistic, the ribs have broken four, one of them may have pierced some of the lungs, his chest has bulged, and the blood has entered the abdominal cavity. The blood needs to be released, and the fractured ribs are removed and the bleeding point is blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctors immediately injected Kevin with an anesthetic and then cut open his chest... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When both Buddha and Vivian arrived at the scene, the doctors were still in the rescue. Vivian’s police officer called the police and asked about the accident. Specific things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, Ms., we also came here after receiving the call. It is not clear about the specific situation. Because it is very late, so we have not The method continues to work, and when tomorrow is dawn, we will look for witnesses and restore the cause of the car accident.” The police shrugged with helplessness. “We will try our best to trace the vehicles that may have caused the accident, so badly hit each other. The car will surely leave a trace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the policeman did not have the idea of ​​being able to find the accident vehicle, he just perfunctory this very famous Ms. Vivian, in the past year, the accident caused by large trucks in the entire empire was more than a hundred, but in addition to a few found the accident vehicles, other accident vehicles are like evaporation. In the absence of evidence, everyone can only express regret for such a car accident, but in fact many people are very clear that this is definitely a vendetta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large trucks seem to be one of the best ways to use vendettas, because among the many vendettas, only the cost of a car accident is the lowest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncovered, there is naturally no cost problem. If it is caught, it is nothing more than a dangerous driving crime. It can come out in three or five years. If someone is willing to pay huge bail, they may leave the prison in two years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sentence of a car accident is really too low compared to the sentence brought about by the crime of one or two intentional murders, as long as the driver and the deceased are not directly or indirectly The relationship is fine, this kind of person is quite good to find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It must be done by them!", Vivian's tone was chilly, she did not think that her two seemingly gentle brothers actually had Such a violent side. When the Governor was in the world, they were no different from the past. They dared not speak loudly. They did not dare to do anything that the Governor did not agree with, just like the flowers in the greenhouse, and even let the Governor’s arrogance for them. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it seems that they have deceived the Governor by the way of performance. These two assholes have even used the means of killing, which makes Wei Wei An is hard to accept this fact in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a cigarette, and he gave an accidental vehicle surrounded by a white screen, listening to the medical use inside, and bowed his head. I sighed and sighed. "Du Lin has no friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Weian looked at him strangely, she didn’t understand Du Lin’s No friend has anything to do with this, but as a woman she knows that sometimes she must be given respect to men, so she did not interrupt him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha turned his head and looked at her and chuckled. "He has a lot of men, there are a lot of people who help him make money, and there are a lot of people who dare to kill him." People, but he has no friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may not understand what I want to say because your origin is much higher than us, others only I will come to you and hope to be your friend, but people look down on us and don't want to be our friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because we are guarts, Because our origins are very low, they are not willing to be our friends, even if we let them make money, they are only partners, not friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
