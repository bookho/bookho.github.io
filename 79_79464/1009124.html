			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that the key to open the door of hope is in your hand, but you still have to curl up in the corner of the dark room, with infinite thinking How complicated and contradictory is the mood when the illusion greets the light? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least the slaves in the mining area are like this. The outsiders have sent at least fifty pistols and enough bullets to them by various methods. They are also told that they can't do anything unless they give them a hint. They clearly hold the key, but they still live in despair - hey, no! At least more optimistic than before, because they are about to usher in true freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, from the day before yesterday, the guards in Brewer’s Bay have become more and more strict, and the members of the mine protection team who are hiding in the house during the week are busy. Put on the windproof suit and ran out of the room, and patrol the guns at high altitudes. Even if the slaves gathered together, as long as the number of people was a little more, they would be dispelled by the mine protection team. This was impossible in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Brewer Bay mining area is located in a canyon. The natural geographical advantage makes it impossible to form a natural fortress without the need for large-scale construction. From the bare hills on either side of the canyon, an iron net was laid over the campsite in Brewer Bay and it was powered. If you want to come in from the outside, unless you pass the gate or cut the electrified iron net, you will not be able to touch the interior of the camp. These defenses will separate the camp and the camp into two worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security here is undoubtedly, all the gold mines are always the hottest things of the Stables, but they have never been attacked. Not that no one wants the gold mine here, but they know that there is no high cost, and there is no chance to enter the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Money is the money that can be spent when it is spent. If you die, then everything loses its value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is just bright, the horn of the wake up sounds in the camp, every morning at 6:30, the horn will blow on time. After fifteen minutes of dining, the slaves must enter the mine and work until the noon. There will be two breaks in the process, one thirty minutes and one fifteen minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all mine owners are working hard to crush the labor of slaves. According to some so-called professionals, a short break can improve the work of slaves. Enthusiasm and effectiveness, but in the end, slaves are still very bitter, all measures are only to squeeze their surplus value to a greater extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some young and strong slaves began to carry the dung buckets after they had finished eating quickly. This is their job. When the gates of the camp opened and more than forty carriages entered at the same time, the slaves carrying the buckets had a short-lived loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumption of the camp is large, but it is not so big that it needs so many carriages to deliver the goods. Is there something happening recently, will it be for them? Does the plan have an impact? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are so many carriages today?", the captain of the mine protection team walked over to a carriage, and he took out his dagger and picked it up. The canvas on the carriage's body reveals the linen pockets stacked inside. He glanced at the other carriage, his dagger in his hand, and stabbed in one of the biggest sacks. In the cut mouth, a large number of wheat kernels suddenly emerged. He used the tip of the dagger to pick up the cracked mouth and exerted a slight force to prevent the continued flow of the wheat kernel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Check all the carriages, the situation is not right to shoot immediately.", the captain of the mine protection team is highly nervous, not tight, it is not possible, now the west There are assassinations everywhere, and a group of free fronts composed of slaves and gold diggers are moving around, and every thing that enters the camp is checked very carefully. At his command, the team members of the mine protection team took the iron and began to check all the goods, but did not find any abnormalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man who led the team at this time said with a smile: "You should know that it’s very messy outside, and we are also risking a lot of delivery, so from Starting today, only two times a week, three days, four days, I hope you can talk to the above Mr. It is not that we do not want to send every day, it is too dangerous outside."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young leader’s words gave the captain of the mine protection team a slight nod and gained his approval. Everyone knows what is going on outside. If you are not afraid that the madmen will suddenly attack Brewer Bay, the situation in the camp will not be as tense as it is now. He casually raised his hand and took over the cigarettes handed over by the young leader. The two men got together and began to swallow. Because there were so many things to send this time, and the carriages blocked the passages in the camp, the captain of the mine protection team allowed the slaves to participate in the handling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of settlement of this expenditure, Turat’s nephew also appeared. He understood a little about why he had to pay three times for a one-time supply. Asked: "Is it messy outside? Can I go out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is actually a white question. How could he not know the situation outside, but he hopes that the young man who delivers this will give him a slightly better news, at least let him have a little hope. Although he rarely leaves the mining area, he will go out three or four times a month to find some fun in the nearby cities. Compared to this damn lifeless camp, even if the nearby city and the town are not much different, it is enough to let him enjoy the long-lost joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it, next time you come over with two...", he glanced at the captain of the mine guard team, "No, bring twenty girls." Come over, the price is doubled, and I will leave with you when I wait for the next supply. There are some cards and things that can be used for playing. Do you know what I mean?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young leader nodded and repeated it. "I understand, sir. Woman, game props, do you need tape?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And tape? Yes, if there is a complete set, it is best to give me a few sets. Since there is tape, then there must be a player? Also get a few!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulat's nephew did not show how to be good in the eyes of the elders, but this kid has an advantage, that is, he knows how to be awe. This may be related to the number of beatings in childhood. He will not be like some heirs who have their eyes in the sky, knowing that the outside is full of danger and insisting on leaving, perhaps just to solve the "expansion" in the nearby cities. The problem. He did a good job at this point. He may not be able to open up new sites for the family's industry, but it is good to be able to hold what he has now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a five-dollar bill from his pocket, stuffed it into the cap of the team leader, and patted him on the shoulder. "You are good, I will talk to the manager of your business and ask him to raise your salary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you so much!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the team left, the captain of the mine protection team stood on the high wall and looked at the far-away team. I always felt something wrong, but no matter how he remembered or thought, he could not find it. Something went wrong on the ground. In the end, he summed up this idea into a cranky thought caused by too much tension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his feet, the two slaves withdrew their gaze and returned to the slave camp with a silent look at the supervision of the team members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three days left! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, the light will shine into the deep mine, igniting the hopes of all, and welcoming the bright future! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days later, the supply team appeared again. The number of replenishment teams was more than the previous one, and there were more than 60 carriages. The goods that will be replenished will be used for four days in the camp, and they will bring in something that Tulat’s nephews demand, such as girls, and small toys that can be used to pass the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty girls in cloaks sit alone in two carriages, bow their heads, and the hood of the cloak hides their heads. When you get up, you can't see what you look like. The eyeballs on the high wall were green, and Turat had told them that they would prepare twenty girls for them in four days! This made all the members of the mine protection team want to roar and look forward to today's arrival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing a piece of twitching "fat" is in front of you, some players have subtle changes in their moods, and the captain of the mine guard sternly screamed. A few times, let them carefully check every item on every carriage, but most people seem to be a little absent-minded. Their attention was drawn to the girls in the middle of the horse, especially when a girl suddenly took off her hat and raised her head. The beautiful silhouette made many members of the mine protection team stop their work and swallowed. A sip of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl around the girl licked her sleeves, she smiled and put the hood back on, covering her in a neat sigh Face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the members of the mine protection team have once again got the spirit, maybe they will turn themselves? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the girl, even if it is worthwhile to exchange cigarettes with others! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the high mood, the inspection work was carried out very quickly, and a carriage quickly entered the camp through inspection. Although the captain of the mine protection team was somewhat worried, he thought that he had not cooperated with the commerce company of the other party for several years. The thoughts of the group of children under the opponent were clear, and he closed his eyes with one eye. As if I didn't see this group of lazy people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let the slaves come over and carry things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
