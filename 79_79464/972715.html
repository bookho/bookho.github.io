			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more rumors about Doolin’s relationship. On the contrary, the city of Otis is getting calmer and calmer. Everyone seems to know what happened. I don't even know that Du Lin, who built it here, will be removed from office with the decree and even leave the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calmer the river, the more turbulent the undercurrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler’s home is once again full of friends, and there are always members of the Chamber of Commerce who come to visit him with gifts, as if it is the first day of the New Year. These people have a repressed excitement on their faces. They put down their gifts and sat in the living room, looking at Heidler standing by the window and looking at the snowy snow outside the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carries a handmade clay cup, and he is thinking in his mind that Du Lin was dismissed from the city of Otis, who will give him and Cossen What changes have been brought about by the Chamber of Commerce in Nass? Is it good or bad? Does it have any practical meaning for him? How can he grasp the initiative? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heedly, Heidler doesn’t really like Doolin at all. It can be said that he is watching Du Lin from a little guy who is worthless to live on the side of the road. Step by step to grow up to the political star that you have to avoid. He doesn't like Du Lin, and he doesn't like this kind of "compatriot" who can suppress himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Heidler’s father relied on the interests of the betrayed country, and a group of the same traitors pushed the Guarte dynasty into the abyss, and thus gained the present The social status. On weekdays, he seems to be kind to all his compatriots. From time to time, he will also relieve some poor people and bail out some of their imprisoned compatriots. This is just superficial work. He needs to cleanse and dilute the label of the "traitor" for himself and his descendants, so that his descendants can fully integrate into the society as a successful and successful social person, and have a certain presence among the Guarts. Prestige. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there was a guy like Du Lin, he formed a fellowship and threatened him, which affected his plan, how could he not make himself Like Du Lin, he is the only savior and should not be Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, Du Lin has been removed from office. He has been unable to suppress himself from the class. After he leaves the city of Otis, the resources here will be thoroughly The opening of the Chamber of Commerce. So what benefits and rewards can he get? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back at the smiling members of the living room, and his interests were on those people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and had a kind smile on his face. "Gentlemen, today is not a day of regular meetings. Do you have anything to do with me?" Do you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously a small strategy. The results of others’ help and initiative to help others are completely different, Heidler’s The brain has begun to spin and boil at a high speed, and something called greed that has been suppressed for a long time is growing quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Member, don't you know that you heard about it? The cabinet is very angry at the accident in the city of Otis. They seem to have to dismiss Doolin. If this rumor is true, then can we do something?", Puxi is still the first to take the initiative to speak, he is very active in the circle of the Chamber of Commerce, although he also considered withdrawing from the Chamber of Commerce before the New Year. He always joined the Otis business group, but the sudden accident caused him to keenly smell a wonderful atmosphere, so he did not withdraw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not been ashamed when he came here last time, but he has a happy smile. Once Doolin leaves the city of Otis, some are limited to only The projects that the Otis City Business Group can participate in will open the door to them. They are not afraid of the members of the business group. They are afraid of Doolin, but now the only trouble is solved. There is no reason to let them look at the fat and can't reach out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler picked his eyebrows, "Hey? Your message is very well-informed, but Mr. Puxi, you said, this is just a rumor, we can't Confirm that it is true and false, so before we get the results, we will treat it as the best for the time being!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puxi stunned, but soon It was reflected that it seems that Heidler is accusing him of the fact that he has actually confirmed the authenticity of the rumor, otherwise there will be no word "result" in his words. Puxi immediately owed a debt. "You are right. We should not believe in rumors. I will come over with you this time. In addition to this incident, I would like to ask you what new views are on the package market in Otis. No?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puxi After asking this question, everyone’s eyes were on Heidler’s body. The last time they raised this question, Heidler made a very clear suggestion of opposition, and told them in the line, if you really want to join the plan, then withdraw from the Chamber of Commerce to join the Otis business group. His reaction at the time did make many people very disappointed. As a resident member of the State of Cosna, his responsibility was to lead the members of the Chamber of Commerce in the state to develop rapidly and achieve outstanding achievements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn't do that. Instead, he let everyone quit the Chamber of Commerce. The only feeling that everyone heard when they heard these words was disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disappointed with Heidler, I was disappointed with the Chamber of Commerce, even if they knew that Heidler had responded because there was a dulin and it was very ferocious. Guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, they are still watching Heidler, if Heidler still said the last time, they intend to throw Heidler aside, go straight from I will apply for resources there. With a Chamber of Commerce general meeting that replaces some of the official powers, can you not do a city business group? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidele indulged for a moment before he smiled. "This is a very good plan, an unprecedented genius idea, and I think it is very likely Success. Since such an opportunity is around us, why don’t we seize this opportunity? As for Mayor Doolin’s strict prohibition on the participation of members of the Chamber of Commerce, I think that may be just an exaggerated way of expression in Audi. During the construction of the city, the Audis business group has made a contribution, and we have also made a contribution. I will find a suitable opportunity to sit down with the mayor and talk about it, and there may be different changes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler’s statement made the business people in the room excited. They knew that Heidler stood here, or the Chamber of Commerce. Once Du Lin leaves, the new mayor takes office. As long as he does not have the tough wrist and cruel character of Doolin, it is not difficult to let the new mayor nod in the name of the Chamber of Commerce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as there are weaknesses, you will definitely bow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone talks about their own opinions and thoughts. Heidele, who has been listening, keeps smiling and nodding. When everyone says it, people’s eyes are concentrated. On Heidler's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler smiled and said, "I still have an idea...", everyone is quiet, and they stop the movements in their hands, they are very Clearly, if you want to succeed in this matter, you must have a person with enough weight to stand up and lead them. Heidler is the best candidate. He felt that he was respected by Heidler and was slightly satisfied. "The seven major casinos in Otis are not members of our Chamber of Commerce. We are not clear about the operation of these seven 'enterprises'. I feel that we should take up our responsibility and implement this aspect of supervision. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of the Chamber of Commerce has not been known for many years. According to some business conference members, the Chamber of Commerce was established hundreds of years ago. At that time, the nobles were very unfriendly to the merchants, and they were so tempted that many businessmen were suffering. In order to counter the inexhaustible exploitation and oppression of the nobility, they formed a loosely organized organization for information exchange and self-protection, which is why the chamber of commerce was born. There is a well-recognized statement that after the end of the Great Patriotic War, the Empire urgently needed a large economic base to repair and rebuild the heavily damaged South, for the entire empire. The internal economic system is activated. Under such circumstances, the Chamber of Commerce, which is dominated by big capitalists and consortia, has appeared in front of everyone and has signed a series of agreements with the Cabinet, including the charter that transfers some of the power from the official to the Chamber of Commerce. In this case, almost all of the commercial part was handed over to the Chamber of Commerce, in exchange for a large number of interest-free loans from the Chamber of Commerce to resume production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, the Empire has not established the Ministry of Commerce, and all matters related to business are handled by the Chamber of Commerce, such as corporate Registration, changes in corporate information, supervision and review of the capital market, etc., are all done by the Chamber of Commerce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a large power, the Chamber of Commerce will soon expand into a monster like a giant, radiating its own tentacles to the entire empire, becoming The holy place in the minds of the capitalists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many powers, nature also includes the right to supervise and review business conduct, of course, the law enforcement power is still in the hands of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can establish a special supervision and investigation department for the seven major casinos, it is enough to make the seven major casinos have a headache, the Chamber of Commerce has countless ways for them to finally come up with certain The shares are handed over to the chamber of commerce to avoid the expansion of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the expansion of capital, there will always be a similar encroachment. In this way, the Chamber of Commerce has sufficient programs and experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone listens to Heidler, he is excited, and there is no doubt that most of the interests in the casino will remain in the local chamber of commerce, they will Will be the first beneficiary. According to the current method of the Chamber of Commerce, part of the profits obtained through the Chamber of Commerce will be handed over to the General Conference, and some will remain in the place of income acquisition and join the local “development fund pool”. When the members of the Chamber of Commerce need financial assistance in the process of development and expansion, the club can use the funds in the pool to assist them after the review plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
