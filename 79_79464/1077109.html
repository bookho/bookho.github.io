			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words can be said to be cruel, in another sense, but the sisters in front of him are not ordinary girls, they are very clear about themselves. It is important to do what to do, how to do it, and how to take advantage of their own strengths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diniya’s face quickly became blushing, and she raised one arm against her chest and looked like she was trying to cover some of the weak melons. In fact, this arm actually pulls out the outline of the melon hidden in her clothes, giving another distinctive visual effect. It's like driving a car on the street at night, and discovering a beautiful back from the roadside. This beautiful back can give you more illusion space, so you can fly more reverie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more sometimes the covert thing, the more you can give more exploration, if that back turns around, and me There is no difference in imagination, and more things that need to be justified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystery is always the most sweet trap of temptation to enter the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very sorry about what happened just now, Mr. Doolin, we attach great importance to this meeting, and we did not have a rest last night, my sister and I have been I read some information on the bed. After I woke up at noon, I was always preparing for this meeting. I was too focused on the work and I ignored some things. I always slammed like this... I have to apologize for my rashness. ", Denia explained it, but this explanation is also full of sorrowful content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She performed very well, as if she really forgot to wear underwear because she paid too much attention to this meeting, and she apologized. At this time, most men will laugh and say that it doesn't matter, and then imagine that they have forgotten how the perfect picture of Di Nija wearing underwear and her sister Di Nisha in bed yesterday, as to whether they are reading documents or not. Important, maybe they have forgotten to wear clothes or maybe. Then these men will step into the peach trap they designed, and they will never be able to struggle, and finally make a decision that is not in line with their own wishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women are terrible, the more women who know how to take advantage of these, the more terrible they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin waved his hand and said, "You don't need to apologize. Responsible attitude towards work is a virtue. Just this virtue is in today's world." I have been very rare in the society. I am very envious of your boss. It is a lucky thing to have such a hardworking assistant as you work hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler knocked on the door and the two maids came in with a tray, stacked some small snacks and a pot of flower tea, which was prepared for them. After the housekeeper and the servant left, Du Lin took out a cigarette and raised the question a little. The two ladies said that they did not object to Doolin smoking, and Du Lin took the cigarette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinissa stared at Du Lin tightly. This is the most contradictory aspect of Doolin. She can see that Du Lin is looking down on them from the bottom of her heart. Personal, otherwise it will not say the words that make people scalp burst. She has never heard of any man who will say this to a pretty girl, even if it is a joke. But look at his current performance, then the gentleman, even smoking will ask for the opinions of the two of them, and did not show the style of ignoring them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One will be a demon, and a gentleman will be a gentleman. Dulin’s contradictory complex character is definitely a troublesome thing in this public relations task, because you will never be able to Because of what he did, guess what he is going to do next. He does things without the slightest can provide the logic of prejudging, he is a madman, a neuropathy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you...", Du Lin took the ashtray from the corner of the table, leaning against the chair and facing the two sisters, playing Playing the ashes, said, "You are very amazing. At least I think so. You have done a lot of things that men can't do, but the society has not given you a fair evaluation. This is unfair. The Imperial Central Bank can send You came, it is enough to explain the importance of me, but what I want to say is that this is not enough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first half of the two sisters of the Hill of China There is a touch of incomprehensibleness. As Du Lin said, the imperial central bank is unlikely to be smooth in the process of expansion. It is impossible to settle everything with money. There are always some people who believe that pursuit and ideal are above all else. At this time, the imperial central bank needs to find a way to find a gap from these people, then insert a chisel into it, expand the gap, and finally open the hard shell to reveal the fragile essence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more roles in this process than anyone imagines. They are the ministers of the Imperial Bank’s public relations department and almost identical twin sisters. With excellent appearance and funny conversation, the most important thing is their noble status. They are nobles. Everyone says that the nobility is not good, but in fact they are obsessed with everything about the nobility. These things are added together and their advantages are expanded wirelessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows how much they sacrificed. Those people are not interested in whether they have sacrificed a lot. All they need is a result, a successful outcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words made them so touched and felt that Doolin could understand them, but the second half of the bastard made them feel ashamed again. He lifted them so high, is it to throw them on the ground again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is not enough? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinissa’s smiling face does not seem to be stimulated by Doolin’s words. “Mr. Doolin, we are very sincere in this trip, very More sincerity, and we don't try to talk about it, who can know if we are not enough, I hope you can give us a chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin points Nodded, "This is what I want to say, an opportunity, I will give you as much as possible to convince me, but only once!", then his foot was clicked on the ground, turned the chair, facing them, "Come on, convince me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diniya, who is not talking on the side, feels that if she can, she now wants to grab the fruit on the table and smash it. She should listen to her sister's words to make some of the information research more thorough. The unpredictable character of this bastard is harder to get than all the people they have seen, but it is not angry. This must be the punishment of God for her evil thoughts. The punishment of lowering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinissa has more calm and calm as her sister than her sister. She bows her head and draws several documents from the briefcase next to the Diniya chair. Put it on the table and push it over. "This is a few cases we collected yesterday. It is a case concerning patent law issues that has occurred in recent years, and...", she took a few more documents. It has also been pushed forward. "These are the results of some lawsuits after the legislation of the Anti-Monopoly Law and the Anti-Industry Manipulation Act."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin will take these documents When he came over, he opened a copy and swept a few eyes. This is a verdict on the patent right, and finally the parties used the law to resolve the dispute and the corresponding documents. It is related to a well-known case in previous years, and of course it has a relationship with the patent right. He said this case when he heard the Adams’s discussion of the court’s countermeasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case itself is not complicated, but the effect is extraordinary, but it also brings more far-reaching influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company produced a canned roast chicken, a metal round jar, and the sales volume was very good. Especially the provincial people liked to buy this cheap whole chicken can for food. The cheap price allowed the company to enter the stage of rapid development. The entire empire has about 30 million to 40 million provincial sages. Although they are not rich, the consumption power in cans far exceeds The mainstream group of society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an investment company that is very jealous of this business, wants to invest in this canned business, has entered a virtuous circle for any one and is still profitable and has a broader For the market and potential companies, this time is not willing to accept any form of investment, because they can not get more than five years of profit, so they refused to invest. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results The investment company registered a patent for a shape after searching for a patent, completely modeled after the product shape of the canned enterprise, and the registration was successful. After waiting for a while, the investment company took the canned company to court, saying that they had damaged their rights and that the canned company would compensate the infringement profits or accept the investment company's shareholding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This case has brought a lot of shock to the empire’s business community. For the first time, people have realized the impact and potential risks of malicious patent registration on the company. At the same time, it also began to pay attention to the new project of patents. Many companies have begun to register patents for their products, and many cases of malicious cybersquatting have occurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two points in this case. The first point is the applicability between the patent itself and the fact, the second point is the universal question, one Whether the description of the content of the patent affects more goods that are not within the scope of this patent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two problems do exist in the lawsuit between Du Lin and the imperial central bank. Adams said this, but he asked Du Lin not to worry. These will not have any impact on Doolin's rights and interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the slight change in the expression on Du Lin’s face, Dinisha glanced at Di Nija quietly and then smiled and said, “Maybe You think these files have little to do with you, but in fact the ministers of our legal department think that they all have the same thing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin put down The file in the hand looked at Dinesha, and a Dinosa will listen to her continue to exaggerate the content, and Du Lin once again made her speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
