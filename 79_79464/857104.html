			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is not in the person responsible for the method of enactment and execution, but in the identity of one of the investors who became the “first batch” of compensation . Someone pointed out in court that a guy is a rich man and has more money than most of them. Why can he get the compensation in the first batch, and these poorer people can't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, there is no such thing as the unequalness of ignorance, but most of them are more than this. They have grown a thorn and found a release for them. The route was over, and it suddenly fell out of the sky. From blaming each other to direct action, even the judges have taken a shoe.... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a farce-like execution process that draws an imperfect end to DreamWorks’ fraud. At least since today, Du Lin’s pen has been The federal money can be returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After laughing for a while, Du Lin’s smile gradually converges and his expression becomes a bit awesome. “Kevin, have you found out that you have changed? ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin stunned. "Sorry, what did you say? Am I changed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You didn't find that you are not the same as you were before? Tern's you, you just arrived at the Imperial Capital, and now you, I think you are a little inflated." Du Lin decided to tell the truth. Anyway, the friendship between him and Kevin is not mixed with too much other things. Saying that they are friends, it is better to say that they are partners of Red Fruit, and Doolin provides the money Kevin needs for his enjoyment and squandering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin provides the legal protection that Du Lin needs, and when necessary, can provide him with some connections and lobby for important politicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the two people are very "clean", there are not so many people who are unclear and unclear, and no one owes anyone, every time Dolin Kevin’s commission will be given to him very promptly, so he doesn’t need to hide anything, he just needs to say his true thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin frowned and thought for a moment. He really swelled during this time. He rarely used to socialize everywhere, and spent all his time searching for fun. . He spends more time on research cases and is used to study the personality and hobbies of those jury members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, he always felt that time was not enough. He didn't realize it until late at night. Now he feels that time is not enough. It has already been in the middle of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did inflate, and when he walked into the office, no matter how old or young, no matter how old he was, he would be respectful and stop. In the work, stood up and shouted "Mr. Kevin Good Morning." When those wealthy tycoons saw him, no matter how many times they were more than his worth, they had to smile and take the initiative and hold his hand and ask him to help them solve some problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even ordinary people know that the emperor has a barrister, called Kevin, no matter how troublesome the lawsuit, as long as he is willing to take over, he will definitely win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like a star character, everyone is holding him, raising him high, so that he has forgotten the feeling of down-to-earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this moment, Du Lin reminded him that flying so high, it should fall and walk with both legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only at this moment, he found out how confusing he was during this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rubbed his face and squeezed his eyes. "Sorry, you are right, I am a little forgotten."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few days, Du Lin turned around. After seeing Magus, he saw the nature of the hearing very clearly. This is a process, one is to block other people. The flow of the mouth. It doesn't matter how the result is. What matters is that he gets what he wants most. With this hearing, the status of the city of Otis will become unshakable in the middle of the empire. No matter who the city will be in the future, who will take over, the city will always engrave the shadow of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearing was held on Friday at the Court No. 9 of the Supreme Court of the Empire, which was responsible for a total of eleven, except for the seven new members. In addition, there are actually four real ordinary citizens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s gaze sitting on the chair swept away from the faces of the rulings behind the table, some of them frowned, some A relaxed face, but the four imperial citizens randomly selected from the residents of the Imperial City, is a serious face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the principals of the ruling is said to be the director of the Imperial Tax Administration. The Secretary is just a title. His actual political status and the minister are flush. It is actually equal to telling Du Lin that he has made the decision. You have already arranged the results for you. You only need to go through the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, in the documentation you submitted, I noticed that you mainly mentioned the issue of taxation, and can specifically talk about the taxation of the city of Otis. The question? Before, and after.", the director of the Imperial Taxation Bureau called Rani, a bit thin, but people are very spirited and their eyes are sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperialist tax issue has been plaguing the new party, and there is no tax on the old party’s sphere of influence. They always have various reasons. After the tax was dismembered, he swallowed himself and left a pile of bone slag to the SAT. Rani also used the tax commissioner to inspect the taxation issues everywhere. As a result, more than 30 people were sent out and only a dozen were returned. There are still a dozen or so missing, that is, a car accident, or the ship has turned over. In short, there are all kinds of natural disasters and man-made disasters so that they can not live back to the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is precisely because the taxation within the old party’s sphere of influence cannot be safely and healthally collected, so after the ruling party seized the political power, it began to rely on the capitalist and used the capitalist’s Money to develop the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, there is still no money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the empire has no money to make trouble, the empire does not represent an individual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The files in this area were all compiled and written by Kevin, so he had already mastered the core things in the content and question part, and he answered them casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I took over as the acting mayor of Otis, I flipped through the total tax revenue of the city of Otis for five years, with a total accumulated amount of less than four in five years. One hundred and three hundred thousand, of which 70% is the tax for the past three years. As a city located in the heart of the empire, the city of Otis has only two reasons for this tax."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, the city lacks commodity circulation, and most residents are self-sufficient, so they don't need to have a transaction, and naturally they can't generate taxes."<br /><br />&nbsp "Second, the city of Otis is relatively backward compared to other places, there is no pillar industry, mainly based on small-scale agriculture, and this part of the output is not sold externally, naturally it will not receive taxes. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But in the month after I took office, I have already collected a variety of taxes of 3.71 million, which is only 600,000 less than the total revenue of the past five years. This part of the tax comes from special taxes and high taxes. With the development of the city, I personally predict that in the next two to three years, the annual tax of the city of Otis will be conservatively estimated to exceed 60 million, which is equivalent to the sum of the city's taxes over the past 40 years!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment that Du Lin finished this sentence, the rulings sitting behind the desk showed their surprises, and even Rani couldn’t help but touch it. Touch your own hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tax of 60 million a year... This number has exceeded the tax of the Imperial Capital, and this is not what Du Lin is bragging about. Because he has already done half of it, and it is still in the early stages of the city's beginning of development. If the empire is internally adding a huge source of revenue, whether it is the New Party in power or the ruling party, it is very beneficial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rani wants to say something, and finally does not ask for an exit. The question he wants to ask is not suitable for opening in such an occasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is another ruling. This guy is the director of the Imperial Dispute Investigation Bureau, although the General Directorate of the Prohibited Goods Investigation and the Imperial Tax Administration are " The General Directorate, but his general director is at least two levels lower than Rani in the party, and two levels lower administratively than the ministerial level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a place in this ruling because Du Lin’s incident involves contraband, so Bowworth directly put this Magus’s cadre Pushed it out. He is not kind, but wants to use this opportunity to attack his prestige and prepare for the next step for Boworth's own person to take over the General Directorate of the Investigation of Alien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the general manager strictly adheres to his position, it is equivalent to smashing him behind Magus, which is obviously a bad betrayal. But if he does not stick to his position, it means that he is not suitable to continue in the current position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of the General Directorate of the Prohibited Survey is called Xin Shige, thirty-seven years old, very strange short hair. He looks at Du Lin with a complicated look and asks: "Mr. Doolin, do you know the second prohibition of alcohol issued by the Empire, and the law on smuggling and trafficking in contraband?" Du Lin nodded. He asked: "So how do you see that you are escorting contraband?" As a smuggler's umbrella, do you have any need to justify it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
