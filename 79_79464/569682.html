			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This shipment will be sent out as soon as possible... No, don't wait for the evening, send it during the day." Du Lin faced Ellis and confessed to private The matter of wine transportation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already many bars in the city to inquire about the purchase channels of "First Love" and "Snow Elves". They are also forced to have no choice. Among the main consumers of the bar, except for some young people with superior family status, the real main force is the adult successful males in their 30s or 50s, and the attention is success. These guests don't care how much they spend on a night to get drunk, they just care if they can make their consumer goods worthwhile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps not everyone likes the taste of first love, but one of the three people likes it, that is a very great number. It is precisely that there are so many people in the current main consumer groups, and even more people like the taste of first love. It is necessary to know that not everyone from birth to success is a smooth sailing. There are always some unsatisfactory places in the long journey of life. First love is for these people. Therefore, in order to avoid the loss of customers, those bars that did not get the wine had to contact Du Lin, hoping to put the first love and snow elves on the wine cabinet for sale as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice has been responsible for production during this time. He listened to Doolin’s words and nodded constantly. He was still asking if he was going to be transported in the middle of the night to avoid the peek of the people of Gothol, but Du Lin directly vetoed the proposal and let him transport it during the day. He may not have figured out why he was transporting during the day, but it did not prevent him from carrying out Doolin’s orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Du Lin said that there is nothing wrong with the danger of transport in the middle of the night far more than the danger of daytime transportation. May be killed in the street during the day, unless he suspects that his troubles are not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After scheduling the things here, Du Lin talked with Ellis again, just said that the raw materials in the warehouse are only enough to produce the next one. At the time of the month, all Buddha’s face was pushed into the door with some seriousness. If in the past, Ellis should leave the room and close the door at this time, but his identity has changed, and naturally it does not need to be avoided as a member of a common fellowship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo’s face is not good-looking, kicked and kicked boots. “They found Cod and sent it to the police station. The police station has already sent three people. The crime of robbery was convicted and it was intended to be sent to the district prison in the past few days." Whenever he thought of his "sacrifice" the opportunity he had exchanged, he was fooled by the other party. He had an anger that could not be said. He stared at Doolin, but Du Lin smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, the more they sneak into the sneak peek, the faster they die!" Du Lin understood very well that nothing could be done in full accordance with the will of a person, whether it was a god or an ordinary mortal. All need to face the complicated and ever-changing situation and constantly adjust their original plans. It is very likely that by the last minute, the plan is completely different from the original design. The purpose of his plan was to retaliate against Codor and Wood, but I don't know why Prando was involved now. Although it was not his intention, he did not object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his original plan, Goredo couldn’t make a man, and Mrs. Vivian’s anger would surely alarm the mayor and the two members, then The top three of the three power pyramids in the city of Tener will calm down the anger of Mrs. Vivian, and it’s a simple matter to send the unremarkable little character of Gotdor into the garbage of history. . But he did not think that now that Córdore had surrendered three people, there is no doubt that he cheated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know where to find three guys who are willing to sin to act as a group of Codd’s, let the three pretend to be three dead, and then Send them to prison. This can be said to be the perfect completion of Mrs. Vivian's account, waiting for the time to almost three out of the three, or directly kill, this matter is completely over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the genius of Codor or who is too big, but these people are too aware of the big names in the upper class. The arrogance and conceit of the big men makes them think that no one Dare to violate their will, to fool them and deceive them. In their eyes, the only difference between themselves and the gods is that they will not discharge. It is precisely because of the arrogance and conceit of these big men that many people have found out that they can drill, bully, and lawless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps in the eyes of Codor and the person who gave him the idea, I would think that Mrs. Vivienne’s noble character would not go to see the three. Assholes, even if they go in person, they may not be able to recognize that the three are the three people she is looking for. Therefore, these talents dare to deceive Mrs. Vivian, who is so red fruit. Unfortunately, they have not counted a link. That is, this incident is not an unexpected incident, but an "accident" that someone intends to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they don’t know about this, they put their necks in the noose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is said that the song is not respected by Mrs. Vivian, it is a contempt for the power status of Mrs. Vivian, then this fish is mixed. The behavior, that is, deception, is a more excessive move! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More excessive behavior will naturally lead to more excessive consequences! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dullin’s heart said sorry to Prando, he would have such a hint of guilt. Because without the cooperation of Prando in the whole thing, the three guys could not be confused and confirmed as the person whom Mrs. Vivienne was looking for, thus being locked into the regional prison. In other words, without the cooperation of Prando, Córdre should still be in the air, and there is cooperation between them, so it will be solved so quickly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After praying for Prando, Doolin put the matter aside, as long as the three were determined to enter the prison, then the Chowdor Even if you don't die, you need to peel off the skin. This is the disadvantage of the lack of intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After saying goodbye to Ellis, Doolin took Dudu to the guar settlement of Tener, and he needed to visit the families of those who died. This is what he promised, then he must do it. He always believes that honesty is the foundation of people's foothold in society. As long as it is a promised thing, even if it will be embarrassing, it will be shameful, and it must be fulfilled. Otherwise, it will be difficult to move because no one will trust a person who likes to talk big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guart people’s living quarters are as poor as ever, deserted, and slightly more capable people work in other urban areas. Only the old and young women are left here. A group of six or seven-year-old children dressed in the obvious big one or the small one, sewing clothes to run back and forth on the streets where garbage is everywhere, and happy laughter came from time to time. There are also some middle-aged women sitting side by side in the roadside, basking in the sun, looking at Du Lin and Dudu, and the cars behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some curious children gradually came over, their ugly eyes filled with curiosity and looked at this car that was not really new, and they all extended hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are asking for, candy, or change, anything. This kind of behavior has almost become the unspoken rule of the entire world slums. If you don't give a little change and small gifts at this time, they may not be able to move. But if they give up, it will definitely not be a small amount of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, many adults have already turned their attention to this place. As long as any one of Doolin or Buddha has come up with even one coin, they will I knocked on the door of my home and shouted out the children at home to ask for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
