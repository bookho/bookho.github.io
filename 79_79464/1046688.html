			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wine...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Carter opened the box, he first came into view It is two thick books and two bottles of wine. I can see that these two bottles of wine will not be any bargains. The hot stamping label can already give people a very luxurious feeling. It looks like a gold-like bottle cap, but it makes the bottle’s body soar. rise. Even the bottles are so luxurious, the wine inside must have a special taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, special taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Doolin got the patent for distillation and authorized to go out, many alcoholics, especially those who have money, began to complain. They think that Du Lin has ruined an industry. The wine made by the distillation method is not necessarily difficult to drink. After the flavors of various spices are added, the color and taste of the wine have begun to change. The bartending industry, which was once not very prosperous, has ushered in a huge development. If a bar does not have one or two senior qualification certificates and has its own formula, the bartender cannot be regarded as a bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The multi-color cocktail is very popular with girls, with a sweet taste and the aroma of fruits and vegetables, and even someone shouting that cocktails are not the slogan of wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but for those who have money, the wine they drink now is a little disappointing, and the alcohol content of the blend is definitely enough. The color is also very thorough, but it is not good. Because it is not the use of dragon blood wood as an excipient for purification and fermentation, these drunks think that the current wine is lacking a kind of... soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the lack of soul wine, can no longer find happiness in the past when drunk. It’s not only uncomfortable to drink too much now, but the head will still hurt, which is far less than the wine with dragon blood. This allowed the wealthy who had a lot of alcoholism to start their own brewing career. They made a small wine cellar and invited some brewing masters to brew dozens of barrels a year for their own use. But for those drunks who don't have much money, they think that Doolin has done a good job because they don't need to spend much money now to easily get drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the headache after a hangover? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a big problem at all compared to the joy of being drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards took a look at the two bottles of wine and estimated the price. At least 40 or more of each bottle can be used to drink the wine at this price. The gentleman in front of him must also be a rich mine. the Lord. In particular, there is a wine glass with a gold-rimmed cup on the side that looks like a piece of art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always a lot of weird states. For example, the mine owners who entered in front of Carter are not necessarily poor mine owners. There are also many very many Money but very low-key mine owner. For these people, the guards know that they are rich and well-positioned, but if they do, they will not allow him to breed more awe. Because they didn't see the "facts" with their own eyes, it was difficult to give birth to emotions that made them lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he saw Carter’s suitcase carrying at least one or two hundred pieces of things, the intuitive visual impact made him feel like he’s going to each other. The gap, so he is more humble than the majority of mine owners in front. He looked at the two books and saw only the cover. There were book covers and straps that tied the book tightly. He couldn't open it. One is "Social Economics" and the other is "World History". They are all highly learned books. These books seem to have some years, and they are like antiques. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He checked other places and found no dangerous goods, so he smiled humblely and took the initiative to hold the suitcase tightly. I gave it to Carter. "I have checked it. Thank you for your cooperation. You can go in. There is a number on your invitation card. Look for the corresponding seat according to the number. If you don't know how to find it, there will be some staff inside. Guided for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter’s face seemed to have an impatient expression. He took the suitcase and nodded and walked straight into the venue. The small guards gave a sigh of relief, and the great powers were great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Carter walked into the venue, there were more than 200 people sitting in the entire venue, and some did not come, took a look at the wrist watch. There are still seventeen minutes left before the official departure from the conference. He found his position under the guidance of the staff. There are still some gaps between the photos and the actual sitting here. I don’t know if it’s a photo problem or a reason. He feels that the podium leans against the right side, just blocking the half body of the doorman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the left and right conference guests. He was on the right side of the aisle, and there was no one on his left side of the chair. It might take a while to come. This made Carter somewhat relieved. He was a fake. A counterfeit mine owner was most afraid of not being able to leave after the assassination. He was afraid that someone would have to chat with him or something. Once he opened his mouth, he would certainly cause suspicion from others. Fortunately, this guy did not come. The guy who was in the first seat on the left did not seem to have the desire to chat with himself across a seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter sat quietly in the chair, waiting for the beginning of the conference. In fact, he did not know that the guy on his left had a car accident half an hour ago. It was not very serious or even injured, but it was very troublesome. The guy’s driver accidentally rubbed it with a luxury car. For a mine owner, the money was small money. When he gave the other two hundred pieces to leave, the other party pulled him and told He has not enough money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the car is rubbed, the outer shell is pure gold..., God is pure gold! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If...if it’s not too late, he will let the liar know what is called “pure gold”! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the doorman went to the stage, the lights in the hall changed from very bright to a little dull and warm, a little embarrassed, carrying a briefcase and saying Sorry, the guy who pressed his waist ran into the venue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mennon looked at him and took his eyes back. He didn’t care about those who came or were late. He cares about those who have not come. He wants to see how many people plan to do it right. This look makes him more satisfied. More than 80% of the mine owners are gathered here. As long as no one jumps out and holds the mortal determination to oppose his dominant opinion, then the transaction market is a thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mad, I encountered a neuropathy on the road. He had to say that his broken car with gold paint was pure gold and delayed a lot of time. "This guy is talking to himself, and he seems to explain to the people around him why he is late." He looked at the guy on his left and saw one or two sides. He had no friendship or talk, and looked at Carter on the right. This fundamental view has never been seen. He was somewhat curious and reached out. "You are quite raw, I don't seem to have seen you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter glanced at the guy who came over The hand, hesitated for a moment, still held together, "I just invested in some mines in the west, we did not meet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? It’s really not a good time to invest in the West at this time. You know...” The guy said and closed his mouth because he found the doorman watching him. After a short apology, he nodded his mouth and closed his mouth. When the peasant’s gaze shifted, he whispered. "Do you know why I said that it is not a good time to invest now? Because the West Mine will be gone, I don’t know that. How do you plan to toss us this fool!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter smiled and didn't talk, but this guy seemed to be a jealousy. He couldn't stop for a moment. "My name is Raul, I am happy, do you know? That's... that's er, Raul. You, call What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter closed his mouth, and the bastard around him kept talking. He didn’t want to answer any questions, pretending to be unheard. As a result, Raul didn't care if he answered him, as long as someone was near him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very indifferent, this is not good. You know that we are not easy to make money. It is good for us to make more friends, if we can’t unite in Together, the idiot on the stage will swear at us. But if we are closely united and he wants to do it to us, we must consider whether it will bring bad results."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you eat sugar? This is the sugar that I brought back when I went to the federal tour last time. It was not sold in China. It was very delicious. Would you like one?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that your suitcase? Wow, what looks good, what brand?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raul Rory hasn’t stopped for a few minutes, and the doorman has begun to talk about the possible harm to everyone’s interests in the “chaotic” market. Carter has to remind Raul that he wants Note the theme of the conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raul did close his mouth, but he just closed his mouth and he reached out to the guy on his left. "We are on I have seen it, Raul, Le Lao Lao, that is, Er, Raul, I am very glad to meet you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know? The guy on my right is too I am so proud that I feel that there are some uncomfortable people. We are all people who are living in the West. We should be united with each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you talk? Was it not shocked by my thoughts? I was shocked when I had such an idea. I originally planned to participate in the election campaign. Unfortunately, the West Mine will be finished soon, otherwise I can become an executive member. "What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Raul turned his head and looked at a few people sitting behind him. "My name is Raul, I am happy." Lao, that, Raul, I am very glad to meet you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
