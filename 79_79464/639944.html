			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, Du Lin’s stunning performance made Heidler feel glaring, in fact, the first time in the conflict between Doolin and Wood, Hyde Le’s idea was to completely abandon Doolin, never see him again, and would not stand up to save his life when he failed. Because in Heidele's point of view, Du Lin's blind conflict with Wood is a very stupid performance. Wood has been operating here for so many years, how could it be that you can easily get a new kid? Just pushed down? But which character can be called a tycoon, which one is not full of blood? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler thinks that Doolin may not be able to survive for a week, it will become a floating body in the agate river, or disappear without a trace, just like he never Did not appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the reverse transfer of Heidele’s eyes widened, how could he just figure out why he didn’t have a strong three-pointed strength? When I used it, I lost it. Instead, Du Lin, the kid who took the dog, became the final winner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately after Gotoll committed suicide in the police station, all the arrows pointed to Doolin, Heidele began to study Duolin well, study him Everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, he came to the conclusion that this is a person who is eager to see the opportunity while also being good at seizing the opportunity. He is very decisive and decisively not like his age boy, but rather like an old bone that rises and falls several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also finally understands where Du Lin is so powerful. His power is so powerful in his grasp of the human heart and his keen sense of opportunity. He used the death of Wood Brothers to stimulate Wood, forcing Wood to make a choice to face him. There is a saying in these gangs that it is called "Because I am up, because I am finished". To put it simply, don't be involved in others. Among these people, there is also the meaning of not being implicated in the family. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Wood wasn’t ready to attack Du Lin, who was preparing every day, wait for him to slow down the rhythm, and to fight each other a little bit, Du Lin If you don’t live three or five times, you will be defeated. But he was too confident and too conceited, which gave Du Lin a chance to decide. From the side, Wood is a big harm to him, but it can be said that Du Lin burned a fire for him, a proper fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, after the attack on Codor, Codor was suicide at the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very smart, decisive, and embarrassing person. If he can take such a person into his knees, Heidler feels that his career will at least On the two steps! So he looked at Doolin's eyes deep, hiding his urgency to suppress, and he urged Du Lin to nod and be able to say the answer he wanted. Du Lin avoided his gaze and looked down at the tea cup on the saucer. Stretched. He took the teacup and took a sip, the rich floral aroma and the sweet and sour taste made the taste bud have a new experience. He took another sip and put the cup back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to thank you for your hospitality, but my next words may make you very disappointed." Du Lin nodded slightly, "I am very Thank you for your invitation, this is my recognition and affirmation, I am grateful. But you should also know that I can eat now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The latter sentence is actually a metaphor. There is such a proverb in the Guar people - "Giving food to poor people can be exchanged for gratitude, but giving food to the nobility can only get hostility." The poor may be in a state of insufficient food for a long time because of poverty. You give him some food, let him fill his stomach and go out to find a job, or do something else. For the poor, this is kindness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the same thing is given to the nobility, it is not help, but an insult. When does the nobleman need to rely on charity to fill his stomach? This is not an insult, but what can it be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin used this to reject Heidler, and also clearly expressed his attitude, that is, he can never be called someone else’s . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler sighed with some regrets. If an invitation is issued earlier, will it have a different ending? He didn't know, including Du Lin, who didn't know whether Du Lin, who had just arrived in the city of Tener, would refuse Heidler's invitation, but the past is over, and the discussion of the past is meaningless, and at that time. It is also impossible for Heideler to know which small farmer Du Lin emerged from. Now Du Lin has become a winger, although in the eyes of many big people, Doolin may be a relatively fierce chick, but he has unlimited potential, but unfortunately wants to let him fight for himself, it is too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
