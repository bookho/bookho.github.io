			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory of small people can only exist for a moment, but the memory of the big person may remain for a long time. Because the big man and the little person's life are closely related, maybe the big person's inadvertent move can change the life of a small person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom people who rely on car wash outside the Grand Theatre of Tern are more impressed by the big guys, their simple clothes, the digested food in their stomachs, All come from these big guys. Sometimes when you can successfully shout out the honor of a big man, perhaps the big guys will lose one or two more coins, or even a dollar bill of one denomination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s obvious that this confused car washer hasn’t remembered who the familiar back is, but he can feel this person faintly. Very familiar, but also had contact with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that he is just a small person, and how to establish a relationship with the big guys that can be called "contact"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin signed his name on the check-in book, and then slightly turned and walked into the theater. There are countless kinds of evenings held by the Grand Tesner Theatre. How to arrange the venues and how to entertain guests has long been a mature program. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of a servant, Du Lin walked to a position on the ninth row. He didn't have much complaints about this. After all, he suddenly emerged, lacking the foundation and accumulation. It is quite a face to arrange him in the ninth row instead of the twelfth row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a variety of banquets or events, the seat can best reflect the identity and status of a person. For example, in the middle of the first row, isn’t the "King" Mayor of the city of Tener? Sitting on his side is the two members of parliament, and then other heads and brains. As for the tycoons, they can only sit in the third row, the position of the celebrities in the second row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These celebrities may not have a specific position, and may not be as wealthy as the tycoons, but these celebrities have deep roots and accumulation. Their ancestors may be a nobleman, and it is possible that some of their loved ones are holding important positions elsewhere, or they have great influence in the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, these social celebrities can have no power, no wealth, but they must have influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Influence This thing is a magical "magic". Under the influence of influence, the attitude and cognition of the people are easily changed by this kind of magic. These people can not only affect the three views of some ordinary citizens, but to a certain extent, they can even influence the attitudes and decisions of the policy makers. Some people refer to these social celebrities as "hidden politicians" and describe their role in this society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One guest and guest are constantly present, the theater has become lively, the messengers carry trays, hold alcohol or fruit and walk around the guests between. Almost all of them stand together in groups of three or five to form a small circle, or a passionate conversation, or talk to each other. In their unfamiliar communication, some things are decided and some things are denied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, this is the "upper society" that people love! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only you alone?", Du Lin turned and saw a girl who was very glamorous and beautiful. She has some shiny little ornaments on her hair, a delicate hairstyle and a clearly designed look and dress that makes her look very youthful and beautiful. This girl Du Lin seems to have seen it. He thought for a moment and then smiled and said: "I am very sorry, although I have tried very hard to remember, but I still have not remembered your name!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl smiled carelessly, then extended her hand with white openwork lace gloves and gently shook it with Doolin. "My name is Freina, look." You are a very busy person, so you rarely pay attention to some posters on the street."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of posters, and she reported her own The name, Du Lin reveals a stunned look, he remembers who this girl is. She is an opera singer, performing some stage plays at the Grand Theatre, and supporting some operas. The youthful appearance and demeanor made her a part of the supporters, but whether it is a stage play or an opera, it is a place that is very particular about inheritance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freina is very awkward in the Grand Theatre of Tyne, she has been playing a supporting role and has never been the protagonist. Some people think it's a pity, but some people think it's good. God gives you an outstanding appearance and can't give you more things because it is unfair to others. It was also rumored that the dean of the theater wanted Freena to be his lover, but was rejected by Freina, and all the protagonists of the stage and opera had never been with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
