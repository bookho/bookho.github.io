			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The kid went to see Bowos from here, sir." Magus's butler stood on the edge of the door. Magus sat by the window and looked at the book through the light outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, he lowered his head and glanced at the gap between the spectacle lens and the forehead, and shot it on the face of the housekeeper. . Because of this eye-lifting action, he made his forehead wrinkles, and the skin of the gangs on both sides pulled up. At this time, he appeared to have a harsh to mean feeling, and his eyes were like a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You shouldn't be so rude. Anyone has the power of their choice. We can't force others to accept our ideas. It used to be like this. It's the same now." "After finishing the speech, Magus raised his head, and the gentle eyes gathered in the paper through the lenses." He turned over one and changed a position. "We have the power to choose, others have it! This is a new era!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his mouth, The butler quietly stepped out and carefully closed the door of the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus took off his eyes and took a deep breath, looking out the window filled with green and vibrant world, his eyes deep and distant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he may not know that Du Lin’s meeting with Bowworth was not as smooth as Kevin’s expectation, or that in Bowworth’s opinion, Du Lin has not yet played a pivotal role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin waited for almost twenty minutes, and Bowworth appeared in his sight with a blank face. The old man did not apologize or The chill is just to let Du Lin pour a cup of flower tea. He sat directly on the sofa opposite Du Lin and raised his legs. "May Doolin, my butler said that you want to see me, is there anything important to tell me?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is equal to rushing away in the social process. If there is no important thing, you can’t ask for it. Then the world will be polarized, one side is fine, the other side is big. Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowos knows what Du Lin’s intentions are, just to try to measure himself and sell himself for a good price. If Doolin didn't go to Magus before, maybe Bowworth would be a little more enjoyable than it is now. But when he knew that Doolin was the first to go to Magus's home, it would be difficult for him to have a good impression on this guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus pressed him for twelve years, and he still wants to suppress him for four years. Although there is no contradiction between the two in strict sense, the subordinates who do one person are only sixteen years old and have not resisted. There is no room for anyone to think that this is a happy thing. In addition, there are always some difficult to reconcile ideas between Magus and Bowworth, and Magus intends to hold on to Harry, their relationship is worse than people think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first choice of Bowworth as the party’s third person, the party’s whip, was due to his identity, he was not a nobleman, nor was he from a merchant’s family. It is just an ordinary citizen of ordinary people. It was only that he was lucky. He climbed to the position of the assistant official, and his ability was outstanding. He had several faces with Magus at the time. He was the first member to join the new party, so he needed such a person to reconcile the contradictions between members of different identities in the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also an example for non-aristocratic party members. Well, as long as you do well, you can become one of the important members of the New Party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this position is sitting for 16 years. He sat down from the age of fifty-three and is now seventy years old, even a little Nothing in the dawn, how could it be willing? The more capable people, the more ambitions they will have. If Bowworth is a mediocre person, he may be very satisfied with the current situation and hope to continue, but he is not, so the contradiction with Magus becomes a necessity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, Manuel’s protest and the upcoming hearing, Doolin is the least important part, and the real battle has already started. At the moment when the mayor of Mangla made a protest, he and Magus began to make moves in an invisible place. From the beginning to the end, there is not much relationship with Doolin, and he has no room to intervene even if he wants to intervene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus this guy went to Magus first, so Bowworth didn't want to see him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Du Lin prepared the ladder for himself. He lifted the suitcase in his hand and opened it on the table. He took out two beautifully packaged ones. Gift box, "This is some special products brought from my hometown, I hope you like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Specialty?", Bowworth nodded undecidedly, He doesn't like these specialties or anything else. At this point, money and all the money-linked things can't touch him. Only power is what he needs most, and what he wants most. If you can't bring direct benefits, the best things in his view are some worthless rubbish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't like to go to him, but he has a wife who likes local products in his home, so he didn't refuse it, just like it was many times before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving a gift, Bowworth’s attitude was finally better. He put his legs up and went to a paradise and gestured. Du Lin could take one. After Du Lin refused, he cut the seal of the land and slammed it in his mouth. "Well, what are you talking about?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some things about the hearing, I want to ask you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a few minutes, Du Lin left Bowworth After walking out of the guarded road, he directly asked a taxi to return to the villa where Kevin lived. He loosened his tie and directly dropped more than 300 coats on the sofa. The back that has been soaked in sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ghost weather is too hot, Kevin did not go out at home, he wore a home t-shirt and beach pants, and also stepped on a pair of sandals and slippers, Lying on the sofa to see the latest tape, the tape produced by the Empire Star Media Company, from time to time was laughed by those third-rate funny plots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really interesting. Who wrote the script? He is definitely a talent!" Kevin holds a large glass of ice juice in his hand. A piece of ice that has changed shape is looming in the juice. It seems that she was aware of Du Lin's gaze. Kevin told the maid to let her make a glass of iced juice for Du Lin, and then she sat down a little bit. "How? Is there a harvest in the morning?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and sat down on the sofa, sighing with relief. The sofa was made of whole cowhide, and it seemed to be filled with some ice water that was slightly iced. After sitting up in this hot summer, the temperament of the whole body was almost instantaneous. He sighed. "Bowworth can't beat Magus. The next leader must be Harry's undoubtedly." In the half, he took the huge cup of at least one liter from the maid's hand. The juices and ice cubes of various tropical fruits are inextricably mixed together, and they should be shouted out with a comfortable mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin was very curious. He sat on the sofa with his legs up and faced Du Lin. He asked, "How can you be sure of this? Maybe abalone Can Voss be able to defeat Magus?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head and said: "It’s actually very simple, from the attitude of two people doing things. I can tell them about their chest and courage. Let me talk about Bowworth first. He is too careful. He has been testing me. He pretended to be impatient and disliked me. He just wanted to know if I was going to give him. The next set. Such a person can be ok, but it is very difficult to make progress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Du Lin's knowledge of Bowworth. From the few minutes after seeing Bowworth, he realized that all the performances of Bowworth are actually an illusion. He was testing his true purpose of seeing him. Needless to say, he certainly doubted that he had colluded with Magus and wanted to sneak him, so he showed the appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest difference between him and Magus is that he is too careful, but Magus is very confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people’s very different performances represent the attitude of the two at this time, one is questioning, one is firm and affirmative. Although self-confidence does not necessarily mean success, the successful person must be confident. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Magnus has a broad view of the overall situation. If such a person can be defeated by Bowworth, it can only be said that Bowworth is too deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Du Lin’s constant explanation, Kevin finally understood, and he shrugged his shoulders indifferently. “You decide it yourself, there is a place where I need help. Despite the opening, after all, you have already paid the money, aren't you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I almost forgot, I have to tell you something, and you must I would really like to hear it!", Kevin looked cheerful or sly smile. "The DreamWorks case is officially over. Today they have ruined all the property of the people involved. I believe many investors should thank you. A mine-exploding friend of mine, his mine is worth a little money, and about $8 million is used to compensate the defrauded investors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "When the investors went to visit Magus and Bowworth, they had an unexpected riot in the court. It was a pity that you didn't see it with your own eyes..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any case that rises to the national level can never be extremely short The end of time, there are many things that are in the program after the closed surface also need, and this is a very complex validation, correction process. Today, almost seven or eight months later, the case finally came to a full stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then extended another problem, only "chasing" back one-tenth of the amount, who is it to pay? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the judge in the court read out the compensation plan given by the Ministry of Justice, which immediately triggered a riot in the court. They planned to pay the money first. Those families who have difficulty living and need money urgently. As for the other part... wait until the rest of the money is recovered and pay for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
