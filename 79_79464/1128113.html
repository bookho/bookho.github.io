			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that Magus returned to his home at noon was to find Du Lin. He had planned to dry the bastard for a few days, but not now. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the influence on the west, even the official in the west does not have Dorian’s dominance. The West has always been under the control of the doormen. The official control of the other side is relatively weak. After the death of the officers, the officials at all levels have adjusted, no matter whether they are against the west or the western people, they still lack recognition. Some strangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In turn, Du Lin’s sudden rise in money in the west has become the most influential person in the West, and it has been compared to the original West Mine. Nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you heard about what happened in the past few days?", Magus brought Du Lin to the study, and Du Lin just closed the study door and did not sit down. Margos asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and sat opposite Magus. "I know, they told me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?", Magus's speed is fast, and the connection is also very fast, which shows that he already has his own coping method, and now is just a process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his leg and thought about it for a while. "Resolving this problem requires more than just my own strength, and the state government." In terms of cooperation, I think the basic guarantee can be implemented in the west."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus squinted a little, then frowned, in his heart There was a little flash of light, and then stared at Doolin's eyes. "Tell me that you didn't intervene in this matter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders. Spreading the innocence of both hands, "Of course, I swear to the first king and the gods, I have never touched these troubles.", there is still a half sentence he did not say, but Magus also guessed, that is him The first thing to know about this situation, but he let it go, let these problems ferment and then burst out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Magus had not thought about Du Lin, but when Du Lin talked about the basic guarantee, he immediately realized that at this time The introduction of a basic guarantee system is obviously a very suitable opportunity. In this large number of casualties, almost all ordinary people at the grassroots level are the biggest beneficiaries of the basic guarantee. Promoting the implementation of this plan, in addition to the insurance company in the hands of Du Lin can start operations, it is also very beneficial to his campaign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, if he announces this, he will immediately gain more support from voters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not worry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only idea that Magus has at this time. If Doolin talks to him before this, he may not have serious consequences. It will make this happen directly. The biggest pressure of Magus is not from so many casualties, but the international community’s concern for the empire and the condemnation of international public opinion. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning over the Federation, Magus and even the top of the entire Imperial Tower are determined to make the Empire a superpower, and naturally will care. The image of the empire in the international arena. Now I have just encountered a big problem at the beginning, and if it is not solved well, it will leave a very heavy stain. Magus does not care about personal gains and losses, but he cares about the future development of the entire empire, and wants to restore the empire's internationally lost points, you must perfectly handle the next trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently shook his head and then looked at Doolin. "How are you going to solve these things?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and raised his hand and grabbed the sword and shook it. "Let them all calm down and things will be solved!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the day, Doolin returned to the west. After returning to the west, the first thing Du Lin did was to find Amon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amon, who has thoroughly invested in Doolin’s position, lived very moist after the Freedom Front was annihilated, and he has now become the most influential representative of the immigrant community. It can even be said to be a symbol of the spirit, a warrior who is unwilling to yield and constantly struggle, and finally ushered in freedom and hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immigrants are proud of knowing Amon. If you can talk to him a few words, you will become a boastful talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, saying so much is a fart, the real reason is that Amon is the richest of all immigrants at present, he is relying on Du Lin and for Du Lin When he came to what he wanted, Du Lin wouldn't mind propping up a "typical" benchmarking character to regulate the minds of other immigrants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like the Ogildinians who have done to other conquered people, set an example and call on everyone to learn from the example. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
