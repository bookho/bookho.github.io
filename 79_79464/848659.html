			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Fohang hanged the phone and called Doolin again, he hadn’t spoken yet, and Du Lin said what he wanted to know. At the same time, he also has a feeling of inexplicable feeling. He solved some troubles in the past few days through a car accident. Now some people are planning to solve the trouble of Vivian by car accident. The only difference between them is that the Buddha has succeeded, but another group has not succeeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver was caught on the spot. After all, Vivian said that it was a woman with great fame and political power, and the identity was special. Even the governor has asked one or two. The driver was politely cared for by the police in the police station, and finally explained the fact that he had stolen the car. This car was stolen by him. He planned to sell it elsewhere. He did not drive well and only played twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, because I saw a large group of people occupying a small road on the side of the road, and a car came across from the opposite side, he mistakenly used the power cabin pedal as a brake. This incident was triggered. There was no premeditated from beginning to end, and no one instructed him. He insisted that it was only an accident and was willing to admit his own theft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But... is it really an accident? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hanging up the phone, they all went back to the small hotel and slept. The next morning, the Buddha left the small hotel and he contacted some. People, after asking some things, returned to the small hotel at noon and retired the room, then took a steam locomotive to Aldo with Jina. Less than half an hour after arriving at Orodoro, the Buddha was arrested in the police station because of the beggars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Buddha’s face was stunned. He wore very expensive clothes, shook his legs, and was not caught in the police station. Attitude. The two police officers sitting opposite him had a headache, and they did not follow the rules and regulations for a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordo is the capital of Cannes. The officials and rich people here are a bit too much. They are not sure what this is called... Mike. What is the guy coming in, and watching this guy's indifferent look, I am afraid that even if it is not an official, it is also a rich man. In the face of such people, the police are actually very headaches. The last thing they want to provoke is this kind of character. If you are not careful, you can get into big trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two police officers are old police officers and see more similar things, because when they accidentally interrogate a rich man or an official or their child The attitude was a little bad, and as a result, the other party did not have anything. They lost the official hat. One of the most serious consequences was a police officer named Jonathan. At that time, he couldn’t stand the suspect’s attitude of arrogant and arrogant. As a result, Jonathan left the police station in less than five minutes that night, and he was beaten for more than a dozen. Finally died in the hospital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident touched everyone a lot, so all the police officers' attitudes were actually good before they found out the details of the other party. After all, no one wants to be the second Jonathan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police officer sitting on the left is older. Although he does not laugh, his expression is very gentle and there is no aggressive appearance. "You know the one you are playing." "People?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus cocked his chin, his nose was so fascinating that he couldn’t figure out his clue, and he had a nasal squeak in his nose. A thick sense of contempt, he shakes his head, "I don't know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you going to beat him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He looked at me with a squint, I think he looked down on me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just for this?", that opening The interrogating policeman couldn't help but ask: "Because you think he looks at you with squinting eyes, so you broke his head?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha is obviously impatient. He is noisy. "Isn't it just losing money? Say, how much? One thousand? Or two thousand? Let me go out, I still have something." He said that he took out one from his pocket. support This to hand to sign his name, along with quite a price you open posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two police officers were also crying and laughing at this time. In the evening, someone called the police to say that there was a fight outside the station. A young man smashed his peers. People, and they are not playing light. After the police arrived at the place, they sent the injured to the hospital and took the Buddha to the police station. The process of the matter was so simple and did not cause other consequences and losses. In addition, with the testimony of witnesses, with the cooperation of Dufo, the two police officers felt that there was no need to ask questions and closed the notebook directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them coughed and said: "In fact, you can run after you finish playing. There is no need to stay on the spot. Before the other party has no further comments, this will make You temporarily lose your freedom." When he spoke, he sneaked a sneak peek at his companion. In fact, the other party had already made a request, and at least 300 pieces had to be compensated. Otherwise, he would go to court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hundred pieces can not be counted, can not be considered less, probably equal to the salary of the injured person for half a year, the amount of this claim is just right, no one can say anything. However, the attitude of the Buddha at this time not to see the money as a money, let the two police officers have some other thoughts. Look at this guy's one or two thousand dollars do not care about it, can't say that he can pull out more. By the time they put this to work, the extra ones fell into their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police in this period basically have some problems like this. Some things are known to the police chief, but he will not take the initiative. The profession of the police itself is very dangerous. Especially those patrolmen in the front line, maybe when they encounter a gangster who is not alive. In addition, the police's own treatment and welfare are like that, so within a reasonable range, the police officers get extra income. As long as they don't break the law, the police chief will not take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many, the following people not only have to say strange words, but also some complaints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are partners, they immediately understood each other’s thoughts, and the other person also licked his mouth and said: “In fact, it’s all trivial, the key is the injured. Attitude. If he is willing to understand this matter privately, then we will let you go if you give money. But if the other party does not agree to solve it privately, it must be through legal channels, and it can only be resolved through trial. So now the initiative is not here. But in the wounded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, today you stay in the shack for one night, we will contact the injured and try to convince He solved it privately. After all, it is a waste of resources for the empire to open the court for this matter. What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Buddha stunned, "Will you detain me?", His face changed fiercely and stood up. "I want to call my lawyer..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two police officers are also old oils, immediately advised Dao: "This is just a small matter. If you find a lawyer, it will give the injured a bad impression. Maybe Fang really will ask the court to solve it. At that time, even if you have a lawyer, you can't do anything during this time. You may not know that the case of a theft case next door has been scheduled for a week. I want to say, It’s better to stay here for one night, and it’s not a detention, just a custody.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police officer patted his chest and promised: “We will definitely find you The cleanest, least crowded room, guarantees that there will be no other things, maybe you can go out tonight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of connected strips Under the attack, Dudu was finally convinced by the two police officers who had said good things. They agreed to the advice of the two police officers and escorted them to the outside of the custody. Just as the two policemen were about to open a prison, they all pointed to another prison and said, "I want to live there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
