			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the long-awaited, Ophelia presented the bouquet on the red carpet, and her appearance was enough to surprise many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not the kind of very charming woman, let the man see the first time the hormones are flying around uncontrollably, just like the underwear flying at midnight. Exudes a seductive atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is pure, at least at this moment, if one thing is to describe Ophelia at this time, then only crystal, Crystal clear without a trace of dust, like her temperament, her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure white clothes are similar to wedding dresses, but they are much simpler than wedding dresses. The shawl with pink flowers sets off her delicate white skin and makes her become Brilliant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyelashes trembled slightly, the cheeks of the cheeks were natural, and the shyness that could not be hidden on her face slowly infected the mood of each viewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw her, it was like the spring sunshine, in the endless flower sea, there was a wind blown by the flowers, with many The beautiful petals are flying in the air, it is a youthful flying atmosphere! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the feeling of heart, the uncontrollable breathing becomes short, she becomes synonymous with beautiful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure, clean, and very infectious, even the three emperors who care about this marriage, when they saw Ophelia Closed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless people in the heart of the skunk Du Lin, this bastard is lucky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent attention paid to Ophelia’s cheeks, her awkward eyes constantly looking for Doolin’s traces, and the pitiful appearance made people want to approach She comforted her with a low voice and comforted her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin is where the bastard is now, why not yet, maybe he will never show up is the best, because such a girl should not be a The villain is tarnished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ophelia came to the middle of the engagement ceremony, people suddenly heard a humming sound coming from behind, they knew that it must be Dooling’s tricks couldn’t help but look back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophelia suddenly had a lot of emotions and raised her hand and licked her mouth to prevent herself from being rude in such a solemn occasion. Romance, or surprises came too suddenly, and she did not have any psychological preparations. The surprises and affection that can't be hidden in the eyes are hot and full, and can completely melt everything in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Du Lin is like a prince who exists only in those absurd knight novels. He rides a white horse and wears a white background. The clothes of Phnom Penh, the complex patterns of gold on the clothes, give a very strange visual sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysterious, very honorable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most unforgettable thing is the temperament of Du Lin’s body. The self-confidence of the child infected all the people who looked at him and did not look at him. At this moment, he seems to be the center of the world, and the whole world revolves around him. A confident smile is an unspeakable world full of domineering eyes. In his eyes, all the viewers have become the background of this engagement ceremony that can be sung for a long time, because there is only one in his eyes. People. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is walking towards her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind him, the two sisters of the Hill family wore masculine knight dresses, red and blue, carrying long swords, the original two girls At this moment, there is actually a bit of a hero who does not lose a man, but also sets off the uniqueness of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a gentle and pleasant female voice suddenly appeared among the viewers. The voice was soft but so clear, and it could be felt no matter how far or near. The sound is sent into the ear and into the ear, breaking into the heart and lungs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In every girl’s heart, there is a Prince Charming...", some people look in the direction of the voice, when they see that When the woman has some small surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 50-year-old dignified and graceful lady smiles and nods to those who pay attention to the show. This woman has a very high level in the opera world of the Empire. The status, the performance of thousands of operas, these years because of the age of physical decline, there have been few performances. People used to describe her voice quality by "the voice blessed by God." She is a well-deserved treasure of the Empire opera world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Du Lin actually invited her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some girls who watched the bustle suddenly looked at Ophelia who stood on the steps. Every girl wanted to have such a romantic ceremony, but this engagement ceremony did not belong to any of them. Belong to today's protagonist, Ophelia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when people thought there was only one sound, there was another magnetic male voice in a place not far apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today, Prince Charming has entered the reality from his dream...", the crowd made a slight exclamation, and the first male baritone of the empire was also invited. Come over, how many gimmicks did Doolin prepare for this engagement ceremony? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, even Magus had to be impressed by Doolin’s handwriting. His expression was slightly moved, and his wife whispered in his ear. "Dullin, this little guy is more romantic than you were. You just sent me some roses, and I heard that you bought a pot of more than a dozen, and then gave it to me separately, is it to save?" < br 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马 马At the same time, there is a little worry, can Ophelia really hold Du Lin’s heart? Although this is a transaction in itself, at this time, Magus hopes that they will be happy together for a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just... It seems unlikely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Doolin constantly approaching the scene, more and more sounds are heard, these sounds are different, the only thing that is the master of these sounds, is in the empire Some areas of the field have great fame and even represent a certain genre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty kinds of wonderful sounds have successively connected a sentence into a poem, and the band has begun to join it. The romantic and elegant melody is accompanied by wonderful The sound, so that everyone is immersed in a girl's pink dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this dream has come true! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doolin rode the horse across the red carpet and walked down the steps, turned over and dismounted, and walked towards Ophelia, who had some tears, around. The sound and music suddenly stopped, and the whole scene was quiet and only the sound of breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the moment we met, you lived in my heart, I want to build a castle for you, put our love in it. Let it be with us forever, until it becomes eternal!", he gently hugged Ophelia, then kissed her forehead, "to give you my most sincere love, only to my own princess !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
