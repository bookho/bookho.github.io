			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These seven major shareholders began to quietly trample on some of the rules left by Doolin, their purpose is to complete the seven major casinos without Doolin’s knowledge. Equity integration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to resist the penetration of the big consortium into Otis, Du Lin made the whole city of Otis with the two rules of token and cross-shareholding as the core. Game system. The core system of the token is controlled by himself, which is equivalent to the fact that he has seized the neck of the seven casinos in the city of Otis, leaving behind measures to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another cross-shareholding rule is to cross-share the shares of the seven major casinos after they are completely dispersed and distributed to individuals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only from the data point of view, every 2.5% of each casino’s shares has at least three shareholders... This is a The number of fears, but it is also very effective in resisting the capital invasion of the city of Otis by the consortium. If they want to absorb the shares of any casino, then it involves dozens of people and even more people. As long as there is a person inside and they are not at all concerned, the acquisition plan will be difficult to complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a very good trick, but it is very effective, especially in the early days of implementation, Du Lin is still in Otis, the strict implementation of these shareholders The standard of Doolin. Privately, the consortium and capital forces had contacted them, but they gave up after understanding the cross-shareholding system of the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can’t take Dulin’s counter-production without taking Dulin’s counter, but they’re holding the casino’s shares because they simply can’t Convince everyone that they are facing them. Perhaps two of the 2.5% of the shares are directed at them, but one person does not do so, they must give up the 2.5% of the shares to find the next one. Maybe they can find shareholders who are willing to sell their shares, but it's very likely that they can only get a fraction of the value that is almost worthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two systems ensure that the city of Otis always implements Doolin’s standards and does not run out of track, so it is said that Doolin is the true rule of the city of Otis. The person is the "king" here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the post-Du Lin era after Du Lin’s departure, his influence on the city of Otis was inevitably attenuated. How can we sit still? The token companies on their heads constrained their profit margins, while the special taxes set by the caps took away too much turnover from the casinos, which made them extremely dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that the casino’s tax is 90%, which is simply terrible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining profits are still being stripped of one percent by Doolin, which is still a net profit, because the remaining profit It is also necessary to remove various operating costs and various damage expenses, and of course leave enough net profit for shareholders to control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not enough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They created a golden mountain every month, and only left them a few bricks, they will not be satisfied, they also want to get more Profits, after all, those that the Imperial Tax has always taken away are the wealth they created, which belonged to them and flowed through their blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some unwilling shareholders are going to trample on existing rules and change the gameplay in Otis, so the first thing they need to face is Du Lin’s two Steel fork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They chose a breakthrough direction - always destroy one first, they chose cross-shareholding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest problem they face at this stage is that there is no way to integrate the resources of the seven major casinos and play their true power as shareholders. Lin can safely leave the reason. As long as there are people who choose to wait and see, there is no way to unify them. Dispersing the cross-holding equity limits the power of all shareholders. The only way to change the status quo is to let someone or a company hold more than 100%. More than fifty-three shares, thus with absolute control and advantage, torn the heavy barrier left by Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This involves more exchange of benefits, and they have a decision to own more than 53 percent through a third-party holding company. The seven major shares, and then use this company to go to talk with the city hall of Otis, to change the status quo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
