			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s confused pain woke up. There is no doctor in the hospital in Otis. This profession has been around for a long time. The nurses in their teens are dealing with problems beyond their scope, and they will ask their families to send them to Nal Lindez. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s leg was obviously broken, the bones were stabbed out of the meat, the hospital..., the two nurses were pale and made a hemostatic dress for the old man. After that, he refused to accept the patient and proposed to send the old man to Nal Lindes. The equipment and staff here could not perform such a difficult operation without technology, so the old man was placed in the station of Otis, waiting for the steam locomotive to go to Nano Lindes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t stand the coma, and he was quickly awakened. This is the fourth time he or she woke up for the fifth time. Only this time the surrounding environment has changed a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white ceiling and the smell of disinfectant water floating in the air gave him a little peace of mind, except that the pain is still continuing, he is not as nervous as before. He looked left and right, and there were more or less people lying around the bed. He asked, only to know that it was Nano Lindes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun outside the window has sunk, the afterglow of the setting sun is red on the half of the wall, he is lying on the bed looking at the ceiling, and his mind gradually remembers being hit by him. He had a hunch about what happened before, maybe the car that crashed into the crowd was the one that the mayor had instructed. After all, he is a prestigious person in the neighborhood. As long as he is beaten, other people will automatically disperse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more he thinks, the more he thinks his ideas are no problem, so he finds the nurse and gives the other a phone call, hope that the nurse can let her family Come pick up yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss nurse looked at the phone number, her eyes were a bit weird, and even this strange thing was transferred from her eyes to her face. She went to the bed and picked up the medical record card and looked at it again and again and then whispered: "Is it sent to you...not your family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The old man shook his head. "This is Nano Lindes. Although I don't come often, I know where it is. My son lives here, I live alone in Otis. You know Audi. Is it? From here, about one hundred and seventy-eight kilometers to the north, I live there. You said the person who sent me? Maybe it is the police or my neighbor, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nurse shook his head and quickly converge on the expression on his face. "Nothing, those people are really good people, they have helped you to pay for medical expenses...", said Miss Nurse, who smiled a little while, and walked toward the door. While saying: "I will inform your family now, you are not suitable to say too much now, you should rest more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man lamented a big The city is a big city, and even a nurse is so polite, it is much better than Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is good here, but he does not want to live here, except that the consumption level here is much higher than that of Otis, there is no acquaintance here, no Let him show off the environment. His son is doing small business here, and every week, people will bring something to him, and there are ten dollars. Things may not be good things, and there is not much money, but this is precisely the capital he has shown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time he will carry a few laps around the neighborhood with his son’s things, and everyone will smile and blame themselves The son always sent these flashy things back, and said his satisfaction with the smugness of anyone who can see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at the moment before his death, he would never come to Nalindez. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nurse on the other side became pale when she came out of the door. She almost ran for a minute or more in the long corridor. Also hit several patients. After that, she pushed open the door of the emergency doctor's office, and then saw the little nurse who had just entered the hospital flushed, covering her mouth with her hands, and squeezing her head down with her head down. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor had a little embarrassment, and soon he looked angrily. His ass moved forward and hid his lower body under the table. "Do you know how to knock on the door?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sniffing the smell of the hormonal outbreak in the air, Miss Nurse quickly turned her attention away. When she came back, she pushed the door up and said it was locked from the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angry expression on the doctor’s face suddenly softened a lot. He sat back and sat down, his face also showed a strange smile, just stopped the blood. Run on again. He realized that he might have guessed something wrong when he watched the little nurse approach the table and stood opposite him and didn't get around. Both eyes fell on his trousers. After a few seconds of silence, the little nurse twitched a few times before he retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That...what...", the doctor wanted to explain that he didn't show up, but he still couldn't wait for him to finish, and the little nurse snatched his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lianmu doctor, something big!", the little nurse tried to let herself forget what she had just seen and said what she meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liemu’s doctor slammed the zipper on the trousers. He asked what he had pretended not to have happened: “What happened?”< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little nurse bowed his head and said: "The old man sent yesterday...the one who sent him is not his family!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, isn't it, they can't settle the cost of treatment?", the doctor's mind is not in this matter, he is still considering how to use the power in his hands to make this happen. When the matter was pressed down, suddenly the whole person was excited, and the voice became sharp. "What did you say? Old man? Even if it was sent yesterday afternoon? Damn, the guy woke up?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little nurse nodded her lips and then she looked at the doctor who stood up and sat back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, how can this happen?", he licked his hair, about four o'clock in the afternoon yesterday, three young people Carrying an old man to the hospital, he was in charge of the emergency department, and he was also received by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s injury is very serious, and it also delays the best time for treatment. Even if the bones are corrected, there will be problems in walking in the future. In particular, the leg that was hit into an open fracture may have postoperative complications, such as muscle atrophy. As a result, he has not further exaggerated the seriousness of the injury. Some of the other three people have made a request, that is, amputation for the elderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a conscientious doctor, Lenham doctors must explain, or save, after all, he said it is exaggerated and has certain possibilities, but The examples do not represent the whole. He told the three young people that conservative treatment would also have some effect. If the elderly are willing to insist on rehabilitation, he only needs a cane to continue walking. If he can't do it, he can also take a wheelchair and there is no need to amputate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three young people insisted on having to amputate and paid for the amputation on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no medical insurance and no medical benefits. The hospitals in this period are almost all private. After the other party took out the money, the doctor of Lianmu decided to take care of the emotions of the injured family, let the other party sign on several documents, and then received the money - about one-fifth of the money belongs to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he used an anesthetic for the elderly and walked into the operating room with a hacksaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came out, the old man had already cut a leg, and the injured family left the hospital’s hospital expenses for a week, saying that they would wait for a week to see the old man. .... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the doctor finally realized that he was cheated, and this will be a major mistake in his career, a huge stain, and even let He lost his current job. He is madly licking his hair, and there is no doubt that once the family of the injured person comes, he must sue the hospital. The high-level hospital will push the responsibility to him. He not only has to lose his job, but he may have to be fined or even jailed. At this moment, he has even escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at the nurse, as a sympathy begging for passers-by, "What should I do now?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to his answer is not the answer of the nurse, but a sudden knock on the door, and the sound outside the door," Dr. Lenmu, the amputation wounded yesterday afternoon fell from the bed. Down, the wound has collapsed, and the person has advanced the operating room. When can you arrive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lianmu doctor does not know how to answer, inside the door, Outside the door, they are caught in a dead silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man was awake again, still in the hospital bed, he just stayed for a few seconds and then hysterically screamed. If the patient who is not the next-door bed asks him what he feels after cutting his leg, he doesn't even know that his leg has been cut off! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he opened the quilt, the whole world seemed to have collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His left leg, no more! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His child arrived at the hospital about half an hour after about half an hour, and the doctor told him all the things at the top of the hospital. Instead of abandoning him immediately as the doctors imagined, he was called to inform the family of the elderly. They need to wait for a result. If the old man and his child have no power, then go to court, but if the other party has the right, the doctor must be responsible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
