			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s two things to talk about Nomi are exactly the two things that Nomi is most concerned about. The first thing is the content of the insurance business. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin and Magus have reached a high degree of consensus on their opinions. The West will be an important base for the social foundation protection business. How much will be lost in the month, how to reduce losses, and how the changes will be collected and counted after the basic security of the entire western society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would you choose the West? The first reason is that Doolin is there. Maggs believes that Doolin will not let anything deviate from their expected track. Maggies has an unparalleled trust in Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of trust is not without reason, Du Lin has done so many things to prove his ability, although it is a pity that he is a jerk, and is a Ambition's bastard, but he is really good, and does not need to waste too much government resources. Magus also believes that as long as he does not retreat, Du Lin can't turn the day. He knows that Du Lin is like Du Lin to understand him. Smart people and smart people can only find each other's bottom limit only by touching a few times. Du Lin I also believe that as long as he has done something he should not do, Magus will definitely come to let him pay tuition, a heavy tuition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the trust of Magus, the next question is how to effectively collect the changes in the entire society of the West and make a list, let the cabinets It is clearer and more intuitive to see that when the western region has carried out a basic security policy, whether it is good or bad, this is the most important data for the full implementation of the national basic security policy in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Du Lin do, the person at Du Lin’s hand is enough to do this, but the name is not right, some people will be different There are various reasons, such as fear, to submit information changes, but there is no shortage of simple gun farmers in the west. They don’t care how much you have. Just talk about how much money they have in their pockets and they will pull the trigger. Give you a bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you change this to the official, then the problem is much simpler, and the basic guarantee policy is also officially implemented, people will be willing to cooperate with the official The initiative conducts statistics and collection of basic information. At this time, the role of Nomi菈 is reflected. This is definitely not because Du Lin is lazy or unwilling to work hard. In the event that someone has taken the matter up the line, it is also a trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing is about immigration. Now the empire has begun to issue a notice of recruitment to the entire international community. As long as there is no criminal record, as long as the adult has the ability to work, or has a certain degree in a certain field, You can apply for immigration and come to work in the Empire. This part of the scientific research personnel can directly obtain the status of an imperial citizen, and then enter the college, research room or enterprise work, but the other part needs to live in the empire for at least two years, and thoroughly obtain the status of an imperial citizen before they can live in peace. Go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To absorb immigrants to meet the rapid economic growth, the labor shortage caused by the rapid development of urban construction is also an important decision of the current cabinet, with all aspects of improvement and economic The continuous breakthrough has caused the social production pattern to begin to undergo dramatic changes. A large number of farmers began to assemble from the countryside to the nearest city, and the talents began to move to the commercial center. This caused a very delicate situation, that is, the lack of farmers and the lack of workers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A factory that recruits a thousand employees may mean that tens of thousands of farmland are now farmed, but farmers who flow from the countryside to the city How could it be only a thousand? Millions, tens of millions, or even more farmland are in a state of lack of labor. In the report to the cabinet in the first half of the year, the Ministry of Agriculture has pointed out that if it is impossible to leave those important laborers in the country, it is likely that after two years, the empire needs to import food from abroad to make up for the growing gap, so that it is possible Famine occurs in some areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reply given by the cabinet is to increase the welfare subsidies for farmers and accelerate the process of agricultural mechanization. The second approval is to introduce immigrants. The market is free to compete, and then the losers are eliminated to continue farming. Of course, the latter reply does not have such a clear statement. Under an effective healthy competition mechanism, people will choose the career that suits them best. See, this is much more civilized. However, there is a premise that it is to increase competitiveness. This is why Magus soon agreed to the drafting of immigration law by Norm. The empire is now facing great problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These problems have always existed, but the previous social changes have not caused fluctuations in this area. The large number of soldiers who died in the war, each of which was a labor force, the disappearance of these labor forces caused a certain degree of loss in the labor market of each city. In the past, the economy has not recovered, and business is still operating slowly. The federal dumped a large number of light industrial goods into the country, so it does not reflect the tension of the empire on the labor force. However, in these years, the empire has completed the accumulation of power, and many problems have begun to be highlighted. This is also the pain that must be experienced in the process of social development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to use immigrants, how to make immigrants have a more sense of belonging to the empire, these are very important and complicated processes, Du Lin can not do this by himself, Magus will not let him rest assured to do this. So, while discussing the insurance business, he casually mentioned that Magus agreed to let Nomi to host the work, which was a reward for her drafting the immigration law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two things that Du Lin talked about happened to be the corner of Nomi’s turn with a turn, her face was red as the first time After walking into the woods with my husband and then going home, I came into close contact with Mr. Jiao in the toilet for ten minutes. It was the best day she felt in her life. If anything could be better than that moment, maybe Her husband performed better in the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is already very good, just in the moment, facing the husband’s betrayal, Nomi, suddenly relieved, let the person slowly regret it later. She also realized why her husband would betray this relationship, because in her heart, power is always more important than love! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Du Lin!", Nomi reluctantly endured the urge to go to the bathroom and tightened his legs. The face was very red and very sincere. Du Lin, "I am very grateful to you for being able to lean towards me on this important choice. I don't know how to express what I am introverted to reveal, but please be sure that I will do all my work. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the excitement, Nomi’s name has become a respected title. In fact, in a strict sense, if a government official has no power in their hands, they may It will only be a little better than ordinary people, such as Nomi in the current state. Want money? There may be one point, but there is only one thing. There are too many people who are hanged in the official name like Du Lin. Whether it is wealth or power, or resources that can be used in their hands, they are far away. Not as good as Doolin. It’s not a problem to use the title. In addition, Du Lin gave her a very important opportunity, an opportunity that would allow her to change from a small department with no sense of existence to a large department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thanked Du Lin, of course, more thanks to Kevin, she knows very well that Du Lin’s choice does not matter, and everyone who chooses him will be grateful to Dade. He will not have a clear tendency. But with Kevin, she got the opportunity. She smiled and glanced at Kevin, expressing her gratitude to Kevin with a nod to almost no difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Nomi, I believe that you can do your best, and this is a must, then we need to discuss the details, you know the West The situation is not the same as here. The local folk customs and the attitudes of the public to things are very different. These are important factors that need to communicate and try to solve some of them before we separate, if you have anything in the afternoon. Work, push it off!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
