			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the old couple’s resignation, Du Lin had a chance to talk to Juan well. “Mr. Huan, I heard that you have a good investment in the 8th district. Is the project really? I really don't know how you got the good place. I think many people are very envious?" Du Lin got all the information about Juan in the morning, including his personality. There are very detailed records. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe because of a low self-esteem for their origins, unlike other rich people who have very prominent origins, so Juan’s character is a bit sensitive. Not mentioning his origins and his failures, he is a very good guy who is very good at chatting and easy-going, but if he touches his taboos, he will not turn his face, but will pull his face very long. In fact, this point is completely unnecessary in Du Lin's view. He is still a farmer. He doesn't care about it. Whether a person is a successful person does not have much to do with birth and wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that Du Lin praised his investment project and his vision, Juan’s moustache was awkward, and he seemed to be modest and slightly head down, but The smile on his face sold out his modest action. He waved his hand and patted Du Lin's wrist. "You have won the prize, but I didn't know what to do at the time. I could only click on the map with my eyes closed. Who knows I will point to that place, I I believe in the guidance of fate, so I decided."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second point in the composition of Juan’s character, he believes that those gods are said to be He also maintains a special relationship with a young psychic. Every year, he goes to some ancient cities that have not suffered from the destruction of war and participates in the ritual ceremony. He is also very serious about what the priests say. I don't know if it is because his luck is better, so the development of the past few years has made him believe that the "destiny" thing is real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin licked his mouth and took two glasses of wine from the tray in the hand of the waiter passing by. One cup was given to Dove, and one cup was kept, "I Just listening to what you said, you are very good at the wine, I am also very interested in this aspect. I heard that there is a way to brew a high degree of wine without the dragon blood wood. Is this the case?" Hu 愣<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan stunned and then laughed. He picked up his glass from the cold table and smirked and shook his head. "Sorry." I really can't help but want to laugh out. I don't know where you heard this rumor. After more than a thousand years ago, people discovered that the barrel made of dragon blood wood can increase the degree of wine. The Dragon Blood winemaking method has become the only high-alcohol brewing method. In the process, many people want to change these formulas. They want to replace the dragon blood wood with some cheaper or more common materials, but without exception they all fail. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When a method has been passed down for thousands of years and is still being improved, it proves that this method has not been threatened by other methods. I don't know what the person who said you has any purpose, but believe me, now the only one in the world. The method of brewing a high-alcoholic wine is always inseparable from the material of Dragon Blood. Some people may add some other recipes, but the most fundamental things will not change!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin reveals a look of ignorance, he tapped his head. "It’s still your knowledge. I almost believed that person’s words to invest in his workshop. You know, I just came. I settled here and I am familiar with the environment here. I don’t have any other projects except for a jewelry store that is open. I still have a lot of money in my hand and I don’t know where to invest, so there is always someone to persuade me. Invest in this, or invest in that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I think if you want to talk about investment, the 8th district is obviously the best choice! There are mature plans and Emperor The attention of the major forces, this represents the eighth district to become the most dazzling new star of the empire once it is unearthed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huen strongly agrees with Du Lin’s point of view And he also took it indirectly. "You said it is good. The eighth district is full of potential. You think about it, when the eighth district becomes a holy place that all filmmakers yearn for, the number of outputs here every year. When there are hundreds or even thousands of movies, whether they are practitioners or tourists who are obsessed with movies or movie stars, they will come here to pursue what they want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "These people will bring huge popularity, and will bring us huge wealth. If it is not too affluent, I will invest in other projects in the 8th district!" The wine in a cup was lifted and raised. Juan felt very comfortable talking to this young man. There was a feeling of happiness that allowed him to speak freely. He rarely felt this way, which made him feel very close to Du Lin and very easygoing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s “腼腆” with curiosity and inquiry asked: “You said that you are not well at hand?”, Juan nodded, Irian The rise is also the thing of the past ten years. He has been lucky enough to accumulate tens of millions of wealth. He wants to wait for more wealth, and his recognition makes Du Lin’s face more smiling. Kindly, "Have you considered investing in some projects with other people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way you can spend some of your money on other projects, don't worry. I don’t have enough money. I’ve heard a very clever word, don’t put eggs in a basket. If the basket falls, the eggs will break, but if you put the eggs in many baskets, there are a few baskets. If you fall, there will be no big loss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan looked at Du Lin a little strangely, and hesitantly asked: "What do you mean... want to invest in partnership with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Well, Mr. Juan, you are the most promising in this city, so I didn’t think about others when I thought about it. Do you think we will become partners?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin's predicate to the bottom did not make Juan feel resentful, he seriously considered it and found that if it is cooperation, it is not unacceptable. The investment in the eighth district almost occupied most of his liquidity, so that he could not get much money in the next year. He actually has an idea that if there is no such thing as the eighth district, he will expand his brewing workshop, so that the annual income can be more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a while, then he nodded solemnly. "When the banquet ends, we will sit down and discuss it in a few days. I think this plan." Feasible!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not expect Juan to speak so well, smile even more, “I will visit you tomorrow morning, I don’t know if you have time?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Morning? Of course, you know my address? Just come directly, we can have a meal together at noon, my wife's cooking is very good. Juan!" Juan patted Du Lin's shoulder. He chose the location in his home. This was what Du Lin didn't think of. He thought that in the company or somewhere else, the feast in the world was a very grand hospitality, and even rose to the level of the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just got ready to say something, he heard a burst of screams coming out of the banquet hall. Many guests were curiously looking towards the gate and wanted to see it. See who can cause such a sensation. But there are also some people who continue to do their own things like laughing and laughing. They already know who they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a group of people appeared outside the banquet hall, most people turned back, because the people who came may be great in the eyes of ordinary people, but in The eyes of these rich and politicians are worthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s Corinna, she’s been very hot recently!” Dev’s retracted his eyes and explained it to Duolin, who was a bit stunned. “She recently shot. Both films are said to be very successful, very popular, and the heroine of this Ilyan holiday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
