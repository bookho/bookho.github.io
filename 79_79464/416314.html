As long as this is done, Du Lin can get the first two batches of two hundred dollars for the development of the fellowship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of this negotiation, Du Lin took the initiative to propose things to be paid to the fellowship, when each money was used, used in Any place, whether it has the desired effect when budgeting, and some of the deepening problems will be recorded. Heidler agreed with almost no consideration, and Heidler knew very well that Du Lin, as the initiator of the fellowship, could not obtain greater authority than Doolin, no matter how hard he tried now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So instead of sending people to compete with Du Lin, it is better to use money to capture the fellowship, gradually turning Du Lin into a beggar Knife. It was because he understood the power of money and capital that he agreed when Du Lin took the initiative to say that he wanted to establish a book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn’t know that Du Lin’s original purpose in creating a fellowship was to want to recruit someone for his trading company, and he didn’t want to be a gang. The leader! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter what, with these three hundred dollars of unexpected wealth, Doolin’s plan can be implemented more quickly and there is no need to continue raising funds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally planned to borrow a name from a trade company he founded to buy a batch of low-alcohol wine from domestic and foreign wineries. These low-grade wines will be distilled and purified. The cover, while Du Lin will not give up the profits of low-alcohol, even if it is not high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf has contacted several suppliers, and Doolin is also planning to wait for at least a hundred to talk to them, but did not expect Heidler The emergence of the make up for the lack of time, completely solved the problem of Doolin start-up funds. At noon, Dooling asked Graf to meet a businessman from the Freedom Federation, who produced the low-almond Almonds at a low price. The market is inferior, but the degree is octave, which is very suitable for purification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Federation is a country of twenty-two provinces in the southeast of the Yaoxing Empire. A republican system has been adopted in this country, and the entire country is managed by 50 members of the Federal House of Lords and five Speakers of the House of Lords. Every four years, up to two consecutive terms, but if the international situation is tense during the election, it is certain that war will break out. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the election is just in the state of war, so even if the members and the speaker have been re-elected for two terms, they can also pass the "special state special re-election" The Bill is chosen to determine whether each member of the House of Lords and the Speaker can be re-elected for the third time. If more than half of the members of the House of Lords or three of the Speakers decide to continue their re-election, then the House of Commons will form a “Special Powers Supervision Department” to monitor corruption and abuse in the third term of re-election because of excessive power. Job crimes such as duties and powers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom of the Commonwealth is a country different from the glory empire that is in the midst of a period of change. In the war that just ended, the Yaoxing Empire won a triumph, but freedom. The Federation has won a big victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may make many people feel inexplicable, why is it possible for the war between the two countries to be winners? In fact, this issue is not complicated. For the Yaoxing Empire, the empire adhered to the territory, did not let the aggressors overthrow their land, and enslaved their people, then they took the victory of the Great Patriotic War. But for the free federal side, although they do not have access to land and cheap labor, they have taken unprecedented breakthroughs in the economy, especially in the tariffs and in the memorandum of understanding that the Yaoxing Empire has not been publicized until now. Something recorded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the vicissitude of such a war, the whole empire began to reflect from top to bottom, clearly being an extraordinarily powerful empire, why is it now falling? To be bullied by a federate, even the federal government. In the political struggles of many troubles and no fireworks, all the voices gradually unified. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the imperial emperor’s arrogance in the war, the class struggle is rampant, and the original situation is seriously ruined. After the war, there was an argument that the imperial system could not keep up with the progress of the times. Only the constitutional monarchy can save the Yaoxing Empire that is already on the edge of the cliff. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocratic class that has lost its imperial conscience, is bent on becoming a new changer of the national leadership class, and hopes that the capitalist intervening in politics will be full of ideals. And the rebels who are trying to change the world in anger... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of brightly-character characters staged a shocking political drama on the highest and most shining stage of the Yaoxing Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under such circumstances, social problems will naturally be thrown aside by the big brothers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire that lost some of its tariff power has become a huge fat in the eyes of the capitalists of the Free Commonwealth, with a variety of things flowing through the border. Into the empire, in the case of duty-free and even tax rebates and subsidies, the light industry and handicraft industry of the Yaoxing Empire has faced tremendous impact and has become a paradise for federal businessmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what Du Lin wants to see this time is a wine merchant from the Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You look very young, very eager to ask, are you adult?", forty years old blonde and brown bearded agent The business eyes almost came out, Du Lin looked really small, too young. He doesn't mind who is doing business with people of any age, but he is still scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders and ordered a cigarette for himself, which would make him look a bit more mature, but it might also be counterproductive. He skillfully played the ash, and said casually: "I am already seventeen, Mr. Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard nodded, with With a hint of emotion, "I was still working as a boss at a factory when I was seventeen, and you already have your own trading company at the age of seventeen..." He shook his head and smiled. Ok, let's talk about business. I heard that you want to get a low-grade wine from me for sale, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lin replied, he continued: "The moon wine has a completely different characteristics than the low-alcohol commonly found on the market. Our wine has a little bitter taste of almonds, unlike those like juice, sweet. Tired people. Even if a person drinks three or five bottles in one breath, it will not destroy the taste because it is too sweet. When many partners first contact, I will tell them that drinking only 2 or 3 bottles of fruit wine, but drinking Our Moon brand almond wine can drink five or six bottles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "More importantly, our price positioning is very accurate. From the very beginning, we have seen the mid-market, so everyone can afford it, and it will allow you to have enough profit margins."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling nodded. He knew all these things. He cares about the price. "Can you talk about the specific price? Mr. Richard, our goal is not just a city of Tener, but the entire province. Even the entire empire. Once we confirm that you and the Moon Trading Company's products are as good as you said, the prospects for our cooperation will be infinite!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard considered it for a while and gave a price of eighty-five cents a bottle. This price, as he said, stands in the middle of the low-alcohol price market. There are still fifty-five and sixty-five bottles of wine, and there is also a lot of low-alcoholic wines. The price is really accurate at 85. But it is not the price that Dulin can accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s simply selling the brand’s drinks or using this low-grade wine as a purification material, the price is obviously too high. awkward. If you want to guarantee the benefits, if you simply sell it, you will have to pay a bottle of money to be able to guarantee your own profits. When the bar puts the wine on the counter, it must at least ensure that a bottle of wine has a profit of 30% before it can be sold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the guests' cups, the price of a cup is almost thirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A medium-priced price position is actually only a very embarrassing situation, perhaps this is why so far, the moon card has not opened the market in the empire the reason. If you choose a little wine, you can drink two glasses. For the drunks, they don't care about the quality of the wine. They only care about how to buy the most wine with the least amount of money. And for those who were originally middle class? They are willing to add a very twenty to ten, but also to drink a little more wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After drinking a cup of thirty-one, I don’t care if I pay more when I pay for it. They want face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of the moon has become an upset in the bar, and sales are difficult to increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you purify it, it will be even more uneconomical. Eighty-five minutes of Moon Almond requires three bottles to purify a bottle of high-alcohol, which is the cost price of almost two. In addition to the juice, labor costs, various depletion costs and a small amount of extra costs that have to be incurred because of the damage to the bottle, the cost will be as high as five or six. Sold to the bar, the profit is only four, more than one is Graf, Du Lin can only get two more! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
