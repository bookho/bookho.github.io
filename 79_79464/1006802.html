			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay! Stop this farce!", the vice chairman sighed when he entered the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at him, his mouth slightly picking up, and the Amp pupil behind the glass curtain suddenly shrank like a pinhole. This bastard wouldn’t really Shoot it? Doesn't he know the consequences of killing the soldiers in service in the Empire? Even if Magus wants to keep him, he may have to go to jail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since joining the military office, Amp has learned that this empire is not as simple as people have seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘭!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam’s body trembled in an instant, Doolin’s insurance for the pistol After turning it off and throwing it back to the table, he didn't shoot, but it didn't prevent him from scaring and scaring the 32-year-old empire colonel with an infinite future. He suddenly yelled at the sound of the shooting, and Adam, who was scared, was about to pee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Adam realized that he was being fooled, he narrowed his eyes again, but Du Lin became very, very peaceful, and he even helped Adam. The neckline, raised his hand and swept the dust on his shoulders. "You have to live well, Colonel Adam!" Du Lin smiled as if he was laughing at his friend. "Yes, you have to be good." Live!" He said that he patted Adam's shoulder over him and walked over to the vice chairman of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a slight nod, he stood sideways and showed the chaotic room. "If you don't have any new questions that require me to answer, then I should leave." "#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vice-chairman looked at Doolin, and Du Lin met his gaze without fear. The two looked at each other for about seven or eighty-nine seconds." At the time, the vice-president gave up half, and Du Lin nodded again and said goodbye and left the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he went far, Amp came over from another room, his face was particularly ugly," Du Lin had a very heavy revenge. I suggest that Adam first go back to the Ministry of Defense to cancel the mission, and then find a remote military district to send them all over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vice chairman did not answer this question, said In another sentence, "It’s not what this kid does, keep staring at other clues." He put Amp’s words in his heart, but he didn’t implement it. If the mission has only started for only two weeks, let the colonel, who is currently the highest rank other than him, return to the Ministry of Defense to end the mission, which will undoubtedly be a stain on the Security Commission. And he does not think that Amp's warning will really appear, to know that Adam is an active soldier, but also a senior officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this empire, no one dares to kill an Imperial Army senior officer at will, no one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they walked downstairs, everyone stood outside the car and saw Du Lin’s well-being out. They were obviously relieved. Although the gunshots of the previous ones were not large, it seemed so awkward in the state where the state government kept quiet all the time. If Du Lin had an accident, he would not immediately avenge him. He will lead all the people in the fellowship to wash everything here, and then take those who are willing to find a place to give the empire a big trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Du Lin came out safely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment of getting on the bus, the Buddha asked Du Lin, what happened to the gunshots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and told him that there was a child playing with a gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Adam’s personal information was sent to Doolin’s desk by telegram. After reading the telegram, he shook his head and laughed a few times. Into the trash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the treated Adam’s arm appeared in the state government with a splint. His face was not very good, because the Ministry of Defense’s gendarmerie command requested Colonel Adam immediately returned to the emperor to report, which is a very bad signal. Yesterday, he and Du Lin clashed, and today the Gendarmerie Command asked him to go back. It is definitely not normal to say that there is no relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Adam wants to know what happened, is it that Doolin’s power can affect the top of the Department of Defense? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vice chairman of the question did not give him the answer directly, but gave him a newspaper, a local daily newspaper. The headline blackened fonts made Adam feel some dizziness. "The senior military officer in the empire is suspected of shooting social celebrities." The following content is even more arbitrarily created, and it is said that Adam is forced to solve the problem by attempting to solve the problem. Du Lin, and he did not hesitate to use the guns in the inquiries of the State Government Security Committee to intimidate Du Lin, forcing him to recognize all the charges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very harsh accusation, and Adam resisted the tyrannical emotions with a trembling patched hand and put the newspaper back on the table, he Zhang opened his mouth and prepared to say something. The vice-president directly blocked his words. "Now more than 300 different newspapers in the entire empire reported this news this morning, including the Emperor Daily and the Imperial Daily. Some people even took you. Yesterday’s rash behavior was linked to the cape family’s assassination of Doolin.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reaction of the society is very fierce now. In almost all cities, there are parades composed of Guars, and those provincial people have also jumped out. The gendarmerie headquarters meets overnight and asks you to return to the emperor to report immediately. Everything happened yesterday, and will be open to the public by means of a hearing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...", Adam opened his mouth and thought Say something, but I didn’t say anything at the end. Yesterday was indeed the impulsive of the wife. Du Lin took his psychological activities very accurately. The 32-year-old empire colonel, after ten years, whether he has any meritorious deeds, he is very likely to become the youngest army major in the empire. The intelligence department in which he is located is actually far easier to promote than the officers in the military region. In the era of no war, it is no longer possible for those soldiers to get a quick promotion. It is very difficult to climb without military personnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the special front on which he is located, as long as he has detected a large case, he will definitely be able to get personal or collective merits, so it is faster to promote in a special department. The normal thing. Coupled with his very hard work, it is not a miracle to be a colonel at the age of thirty-two today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, he also has a big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pride will one day be crushed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military always has some military conveniences. From the west to the emperor, there are long roads to transfer several times, but the military can use some military Proprietary railway. When the war with the federal defending country was in the same year, the empire suffered a big loss on the supply line. If the federal advancement was too fast, the troops and aid of the major military regions of the empire could not be sent to the front line, forcing the Imperial Ministry of Defense to decide to fight in the south of the city of Otis. I am afraid that the trend of the war may not be so bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but then again, if there is a perfect dedicated supply line, maybe the federation will not be able to take care of the main force because the supply line is too long. The main force was surrounded, and it is really hard to say that the last empire still exists. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after the war, the Imperial Army built a large number of military railways as a war supply line, and it took only 30 hours from the west to the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second day after Adam returned to the empire, the third day after the incident, the hearing began. Dooling did not ask Magus to help him. He had only one small request to make Kevin the moderator. Magus considered that it was very difficult to converge with Doolin's character. It is very difficult to know that the bastard is mad and the mayor has dared to kill, so he met Du Lin's request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the hearing, Adam left the hall of the Imperial Department of Justice in an eyeless manner. According to his reply at the hearing, everyone finally agreed that he did not meet the requirements of the active duty officer and sent the opinion to the Ministry of Defense and The Gendarmerie Command, waiting for the final trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, on the morning of the seventh day of the incident, another major event took place in the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angry Du Lin stepped out of the West Mine and he just made a strong protest against the West Mine, hosted by the West Mine. In seven transactions, almost all of the seven minerals he purchased were identified as waste mines, and he was “deceived”. Therefore, he will seek justice in the West Mine, but these people in the West Mine will have begun to reject Du Lin. It can even be said that Du Lin bought these seven waste mines and also the credits of the Executive Committee members of the West Mine. How could they be Du Lin Shenxi? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on the grounds that Du Lin was not a member of the Western Mining Association, they rejected his request for compensation from seven mine owners and also rushed him out. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Doolin was just about to get out of the car, there were three cars coming quickly on the street, coming close to Doolin, sitting in the car. The man with the mask poked out of the window. They were holding a pistol and fired at Du Lin standing on the side of the road. After confirming that Du Lin fell in a pool of blood, these people quickly left the scene, the entire West Mine. Will include all the mess around! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the news was sent back to the doorman’s hand, the doorman’s face was cold for twenty days, and finally he smiled. He still sighed in his heart. But soon he realized that his big trouble was coming. The previous attack on the city hall had not yet resulted, and the public figure of Doolin was attacked on his site. He is still in the hospital and is still dying. If Mr. Kesma knows about this, will he send him a black card? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scalp began to numb at the thought of so many troublesome things! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hell, arrange your own personal secretary to pay the money of the mine victims first. He picks up the jacket and lifts the bag, so people can send him. Go to the hospital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going to visit Du Lin, at least to see if he is dead or not, preferably not dead, at least in the past that can be explained to Mr. Hope it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
