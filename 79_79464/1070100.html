			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mr. Jackson’s narrative, Du Lin knew what happened in the morning. He talked to Mr. Jackson separately five days ago, when Mr. Jackson did not Thoroughly turned to Doolin, but he and Du Lin made an appointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Du Lin told Mr. Jackson very positively that the two major banks could not support an opponent to compete for their future interests, no matter what promises the two major banks gave them. In the end, they will formulate some legally beneficial termination agreements and let them go bankrupt if necessary to release market potential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s cultivate an enemy and then be defeated by him to prove the change of the times, or if the capitalist who waits for him to be strong and then defeat him to prove his strength is not Existence, the essence of the capitalist is full of endless desires for the interests, perhaps in history has indeed been such a "excellent" capitalist, but they are all dead, and even the bones are not left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more mature economies are more interested in playing capital games, if one day you feel that there is someone who does not ask for a return, sincerely for your good For your sake, if you want to give you the best things, when you think about you all the time, there are only two possibilities:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Maybe it is your family and your elders, and their love for you will never be mixed with other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second possibility that person must be the sales manager of a company, you can treat him as a son who has been separated for many years but is filthy. Mr. Jackson reached the meeting site, and after meeting everyone, he took out the insurance company registration certificate according to the previous statement. The shareholders are their “individuals” and then they Signed an industry self-discipline and agreed to Mr. Taylor’s request for a deposit of no less than 50 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr. Perito took out a two-inch agreement, and after the lawyer’s explanation, they signed their name. After signing the word, Mr. Perito also did "give" them 50 million. However, these five thousand are not directly used by them, but continue to be placed in the treasury of the Southern Commercial Bank, or placed in the public account registered by the Western Insurance Company in the South Commercial Bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the agreement between them, when the western insurance company has to pay the insurance premium, they will submit the claim again after the initial approval of the western insurance company. To the Southern Commercial Bank and the Southern Commercial Bank to organize an investigation team to investigate. After the investigation concluded that they should actually pay, they will take out the insurance money that needs to be settled from the 50 million miles that they put in their own treasury but belong to the western insurance company. Handed over to the rights holder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the real money and silver of the Southern Commercial Bank don’t need to be taken out. The Western Insurance Company has already borrowed 50 million of the same air from them. The reason for this is that they will The company's account was opened in the Southern Commercial Bank, and the money was "save" in. Perito and South Commercial Bank were equal to the left hand for the right hand and the third insurance company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of behavior, this kind of behavior is simply insulting Mr. Jackson and others, but they have signed a series of contracts, including one signed with Southern Commercial Bank Series agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the agreement they have signed, if they don’t play now, they declare bankruptcy and liquidation, they have to bear 50 million loans, and as a “special project” Loan, if the money cannot be used in the special business, that is, the insurance company's deposit, they must pay the normal bank interest, and the interest will be paid for three years, and will be able to pay the principal again after three years. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, the Western Insurance Company, Mr. Jackson and others, opened a company account with the Southern Commercial Bank and loaned the Southern Commercial Bank to them. Into the insurance company's deposit of 50 million deposits. In the middle, the Southern Commercial Bank and the Western Insurance Company signed a different loan contract. The Southern Commercial Bank lends 50 million yuan of cash as a special fund without the mortgage, that is, the western insurance company’s industry deposit is loaned to Western Insurance Company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no collateral, for the safety of funds, Southern Commercial Bank requires Western Insurance Company to ensure and sign a special contract, in the supplementary terms, these five Ten million loans must exist in the Southern Commercial Bank. At the same time, in order to avoid risks, the claims made by the Western Insurance Company need to be confirmed by the South Commercial Bank before they can be paid to prevent fraudulent insurance and current activities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The western insurance company loses its ability to provide insurance services for whatever reason, and the 50 million loan will follow the normal loan. The interest rate is executed and executed for three years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From a commercial point of view, the Southern Commercial Bank is very strong in this series of contractual agreements, but they are not wrong. There are no collateral, no specific things to resist the risk, they have been very conscience, it is a business model. There are a series of questions, the most prominent of which are the three insurance companies cross-share each other. According to the requirements of the South Commercial Bank and the Imperial Central Bank, the three companies are based on market value. The exchange of shares, to a certain extent, is a very good news for the retailers who are warming up like Jackson. It is like a group of poor ghosts who used a brick from the road to build a three-story broken house. Now They exchanged two of the two skyscrapers next door with the two floors of the broken house, and they earned it anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can this be actually the case? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course not, playing capital games with banks and bankers is not a simple matter, Mr. Jackson and others are willing to sign the previous ones that are not equal and obvious The contractual agreement to put yourself at a disadvantage is because the two major banks have taken the cross-shareholding as a temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can completely transform into the shareholders of the two major insurance companies, complete a gorgeous transformation, they have nothing to lose, as long as the two I am really willing to sign, which means they earned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the operation of the next two big lines made them realize that from the beginning to the end, the two major lines did not consider using them as partners, perhaps they were one-off The handy tools are more suitable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the previously agreed calculated market capitalization - the idea of ​​Mr. Jack and others is that each company in the three companies has a deposit of 50 million, although the three companies have Registered, but until now there are no other assets, it can be said that the three current market values ​​are equal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are too high on the banker’s conscience and protection of the face, too underestimating the ambitions and means of these people. Subsequently, both Berito and Taylor took out a new instrument. The two major banks “unanimously” borrowed 150 million yuan of cash from the two insurance companies unconditionally and without interest, and the deposits of the two insurance companies. From 50 million directly to 200 million! In other words, the total assets of the western insurance companies at this time are only 25 percent of either of them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the "equivalent" cross-shareholding requirements of the two parties, Southern Commercial Insurance Company and Imperial Insurance Company each took out 15% of the shares as cross-shareholding The proportion of the company is 7.5%, which is part of the exchange of shares between Southern Commercial Insurance Company and Imperial Insurance Company. The other part is the 75% of the shares of the two companies, which will replace the West. The insurance company has 30% of the shares, which means that 60% of the shares of the western insurance company are held by the two major banks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just ten minutes, the Western Insurance Company became the embarrassment of the two major banks, and they also took on a heavy loan, let Jackson even more Mr. Dissatisfied is because they are solid investors, so even if only 40% of the remaining shares are not owned by one individual, but seven people, each person is allocated according to the amount Three to eight percent of the shares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
