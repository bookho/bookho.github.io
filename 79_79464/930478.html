			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lapuan lived here for three days at Mr. Tucks. They discussed a lot of things, including personal opinions and positions. They have to say that they have Almost the same hobbies and opinions, this is indeed a very happy thing. Not only is someone affirmed himself, but this person is just like himself. Mr. Tucks thinks that Mr. Lapuan is very appetizing for himself and constantly persuaded him to stay here for a few days. He has not been so happy for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days, Lapuan turned over Mr. Tucks’s study and finally found a file in the safe. material. There are some documents related to the distribution of dividends in the jewelry store and the composition of the company. Lapuan replaced the documents with some white paper and secretly put the documents into his own bag. This is not to hurt Tucks, but to help him. They may not be together for a long time, but Lapuan feels that Tucks is a good person. He is very enthusiastic and polite, and has no arrogance for anyone who often appears on the rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Lapian is helping him, first figuring out what Du Lin is doing, and then taking him out of the case. Otherwise, if one day Du Lin suddenly becomes unlucky, he will definitely involve Mr. Tucks. After all, he has no way to explain why a robber who robbed the bank of gold has to cooperate with an ordinary jeweler and give it every year. He divides a large number of bonuses because he is a jeweler? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe some people will greedy the property in his hands, or they may simply want to increase the number of people involved to a larger number. In short, he is very dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Man, I have to go tomorrow, I have some other things waiting for me to do it, the next time I come here again, we Then contact." Lapuan looked a little smoked. He took a picture of Mr. Tucks's back and his eyes were a little straight. "Listen to me, protect yourself, the world is not peaceful!" Mr. Tucks has a good amount of alcohol. He only said that Mr. Lapuan was drunk, he shrugged his shoulders, "the federal police ratio." The Imperial Police is more responsible, which is why I settled here. As long as I need it, in less than two minutes, there will be a police car parked where I need help. This is the Federation!", said Mr. Tucks Instead, he persuaded Lapian. "I suggest that if you can abandon something, it is better to settle in the Federation. Here you will find that everything we have in this country is like the will of God."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rubbed his fingers and made counts of money. "Money, here is omnipotent, and we are not short of money, why not come to heaven?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He said that there is nothing wrong with it. The role of federal money is far more than that of the empire. In this country of more than a dozen merchants, the status of merchants and commerce is very high, and everyone is paying money. Look, you have to have money to prove yourself. Even the classifications in the school are mostly related to money. For example, the most popular subjects, the teachers will tell the students that they can find a good job and get the value of their own life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for those less popular subjects, there are fewer people. The reason why some people are studying is also the teacher telling them that maybe our profession will burst that day. As a minority, we immediately have the salary level that others can accumulate in a few years and years. Therefore, these "speculative students" have chosen these relatively unpopular occupations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two drank a lot of wine, and they all walked up and down, just when they just went out, one person passed them by, and With such a moment of collision. The man took a few steps to stop, apologized to them and apologized for their forgiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gust of wind blew, Lapuan’s head was a little clear, and he fiercely screamed, and immediately reached out and touched his jacket pocket—the wallet was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wallet is very heavy, in addition to money and coins, there are some small metal cards that outsiders can't understand. These small cards have a lot of pinhole-sized holes, some of which are keys that are used to open some rooms or cabinet keys in the base, and some that hold a lot of information. There is a machine in the base that can turn large sections of text into such small cards, and only need to be stuffed into the decryption machine to be able to re-create the text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the unusual behavior of Mr. Lapuan, Mr. Tucks’s drunkenness has also subsided a lot. He immediately asked what happened, but he did not wait Puan answered, he realized that the man was a thief. Without the consent of Mr. Lapuan, he immediately turned back to the bar and dialed the alarm call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he described, it took less than a hundred seconds, and a policeman carrying four police officers appeared in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These police officers do not have the power of the imperial police, but they are more like good talkers, which is also the role of money. Because this is a rich area, the people living here are not rich and expensive, not the small policemen who can be offended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me...who is the policeman?" The policeman with the policeman’s badge on his chest politely asked, Mr. Tucks Stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened here?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Tucks pointed out that Mr. Lapuan, who was almost completely awake, said: "My friend’s wallet was stolen by a guy wearing a yellow T-shirt about five minutes ago. Got, the dress also has a hat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police just prepared to further interrogate, and Lapuan suddenly inserted a sentence, "Forget it, in the wallet. There are only a few tens of dollars, and there are no valuable things. I don’t bother the policemen to work hard in the middle of the night.” His identity is problematic. It’s not afraid that these little policemen can see his identity, the Imperial Intelligence The Federation has done his identity as perfect as possible. It’s just a matter of less than one thing. Those cards returning to declare a new one will be fine. Anyway, people here may not be able to unlock the password. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect Mr. Tucks to disagree. “My friend, you came to me, I have not received you very well, now I also let you lose your wallet, which makes me very embarrassed. Listen to me, I believe that the federal police are very capable as a group of capable people, will definitely help you find your wallet, right?", he finally said When I was "yes," I looked at the four policemen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four police officers did not hear the threats hidden in Mr. Tucks’s words at all, and nodded and said they would be able to get the damn thief back. This may take two or three times. So they hope to register the information of the owner, so that they can be sent back after they get back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, how perfect the federal police service is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Tucks’s determination, Lapuan has no objection to it. He cooperates with the police to register information and looks away from the thief’s departure. go with. He hopes that the thief can run away from the distance, or the things in the wallet may attract the attention of some people. At the same time, he also hopes that there is no such decoding machine on the federal side, so that there will not be many incidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After registering the personal information, the sheriff smiled and asked, "Listen to your accent, it seems that you are not a local?", he almost said that Lapuan is an imperial person, just considering that there are more immigrants recently, in order to avoid Stimulating these rich people, so he euphemistically expressed doubts about the identity of Lapian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lapuan nodded. "Yes, I am an imperial man. This time, I came to do business and get together with my friends. What happened? Allow us to appear here?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, you misunderstood, if you are from the Empire, I hope that you can relax and relax here, we have enthusiasm The girl, there is also a fragrant wine, I wish you a happy stay here!", the police put away the record in the pocket, and after saying goodbye to Mr. Tucks, driving the police car in the direction they just pointed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They must be able to retrieve your wallet!", Tucks comforted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hope!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the police car, the sheriff picked up the intercom to call the police In the bureau, he sent some information that Lapuan told him to the police station, and let the operator immediately send the information to the information office to let people check the true and false. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualified and capable of being responsible for the law and order of the rich and a series of problems, obviously this requires a strong ability and a smart mind, when Lapuan said When the sentence was counted, he immediately felt that this person might have problems. No one will lose the wallet and say it. If there is, then this person obviously has other important things to do, and this Mr. Lapuan is from the empire, the sheriff suspects that he may be a spy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this level, he can already understand something that ordinary people don’t know. For example, the spy war between the Empire and the Federation, both sides are ambushing opposite. A large number of spies, snooping to steal important information, and even participate in assassination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police car stopped at the roadside after almost a few hundred meters of turning. The sheriff dialed the phone number of the biggest thief gang leader nearby. The image of the thief in the description of the two rich people came out, let him find out as much as possible to find out, and then took the wallet to the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a simple matter of simply losing a wallet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
