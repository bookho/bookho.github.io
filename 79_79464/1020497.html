			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric looked at the burning banknotes and then lit the cigarettes with the flames lit by the banknotes. Du Lin’s hands were loose and he had burned half of the banknotes. The ashes fell on the ground, slowly curled, slowly burned, and slowly extinguished into two pieces of black ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two hundred points of cigarettes, is it more mellow?", Du Lin did not wait for Eric to answer this question, he smiled a little, "Ai Rick, can we be friends?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric took a deep breath and slowly spit out, which made him more relaxed. He was ashamed of his fear of death, but this kind of easy to survive defeated his embarrassment. He raised his eyebrows and said thoughtfully: "You want to buy me!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buy?", Du Lin couldn't help but laugh, he shook his fingers. "No, no, buy the word to insult you and insult me. I Never use anything to buy anyone, I only make friends with friends, friends, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say your child is about to be born... This is very good. A family with children is a complete family, but have you considered your family’s happiness in this society? When you and your family are walking on the road, look at people like me. Luxury cars, expensive luxury goods, high-end places, and those who have the power to make a difference, perhaps just because we chatted with interest and said something irresponsible, but some things began to change." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That way you Does your family have some helplessness?” Du Lin’s tone has become deeper. “You sold your life to the Security Council in exchange for a negligible amount of money, but only for your family. Life is like an ordinary person. Maybe you have some deposits, but those deposits are not even enough for one-tenth or one percent of my friends’ nights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eric, life is so precious, your God has let you have the luck of detachment and come to this world, but you have sold your luck to something that is similar to me. Just a person wearing different clothes, is this really your pursuit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it all worth it?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a struggle in Eric's eyes. After closing his lips and listening to Du Lin's words, he thought for a long time and replied: "I didn't give anyone a life, I just dedicated my loyalty to the empire! "At the moment when his voice fell, Du Lin waved his hand with a very firm and denied his answer. "Imperial, empire is a concept, should not be It’s a specific person. The vice-chairman of the Security Council you know, the highest commander of the Ministry of Defense, and even Magus, they are all concrete people. They can’t represent the empire, and they’re less likely to be above the empire. You said that you are loyal to the empire, I want to praise your love for the empire, but you have considered it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the new party is elected, the old party will be on the stage. Now, do you still want to continue your alleged loyalty?" The question is actually very sharp, because since the reign of Maggs overthrew the rule of the old era, the New Party has always been in power, and everyone in the government has put Maggs and The new party is regarded as the "state" Specific, but as Herr said, in case of in case the old party defeated the New Party came to power, they will continue to own allegiance to it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their leadership is likely to be replaced by the old party, some people who have very different values ​​and worldviews from the New Party, their governance philosophy and even Political ambitions are likely to be contrary to the New Party. So in this case, do they still have to do this like today, so that the old party in power is going to sell their lives? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is not the first person who has this feeling and said it. After the mid-term election, many middle-level officials of the imperial government have this kind of sorrow. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the New Party has brought many changes to the empire, making this society more fraternal, people have freedom, and the sunshine brings justice. But this does not mean that the New Party is able to defeat the old party and continue to suppress the old party in the general election. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six-year pre-election new party successfully defended the power of representative power with 67% of the votes, but today, both sides Is the support rate closer? I have to know that the support rate of the New Party in the second general election is 93%! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many reasons for this phenomenon, such as the social elites of the old parties, such as their design of the "conformity" framework, for example, they gave The ladder that people can see makes everyone have a way to step on someone else's head and climb up. A variety of factors have caused the New Party's concept of governance to be recognized by many social middle classes. These middle classes, who are eager to enter the social upper class, are more inclined to the old party's decadent upgrade system than the new party's survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people who are willing to support and maintain the decaying things can only show that there are some things that are still very tempting. If it is really two years later, the new party will be replaced by the new general election, the old party will come to power, and now these have served the empire for more than ten or twenty years. What should people do, who have been growing up in the soil of the New Party? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it against the old party, or is it a position to obey the old party? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid that any choice is a problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you choose to resign or transfer to another place, then prove that the allegiance empire you are here in front of me is just that you deceive yourself. If you choose to stay in the Security Council to serve the old party, you can do things according to the instructions of the old party without distinguishing right from wrong. What you do is in conflict with today. What do you think others will say? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric was caught in silence, he didn't know how to answer Du Lin's question, and Du Lin's problem made him feel very embarrassed. Even shaken his beliefs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were silent for a while, and Du Lin said in a relaxed tone: "In fact, it is very easy to solve these problems!", Eric immediately looked up He, see what he wants to say next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said this is very simple, it is really simple. When you climb high enough that it will not be shaken by some changes, you really Eligible to do something for this country, not like a boat that is helpless on the sea, can only float along the waves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Everything is in your choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say, will we be friends?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When Du Lin came out of the room, the sun was shining outside, and Buddha immediately came over and said something in his ear. Just when Du Lin and Eric chatted, they had already investigated Eric. Said things. It is not difficult to find out the information of an "ordinary person" by Du Lin's means and contacts. Eric didn't lie. He said everything he could say, which made Du Lin very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death is the most feared thing for human beings, even he is afraid of death, but he is afraid to die in ordinary peace, if one day his death can Bringing change to the whole world, then he will happily leave the world - in fact, it will not, it is better to live than to live, as long as you live, you will have the opportunity to find a breakthrough opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are those people?" Du Lin asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are referring to the gold digger who came to the town not long ago, and now someone is staring at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people were divided into three batches into the town. They thought they were hiding well, but they ignored a very important thing. They didn't ride horses. Horses are second only to their lives for gold diggers. There is no way to travel in the wild west without horses. Together with Doolin’s previous instructions, they were discovered when they came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Brest is not aware that his disguise has been seen, this does not blame him, he is just a gold digger with no culture, he believes himself The gun in his hand is better than the head full of knowledge. He sat at a round table with a glass of wine and listened to the chats of people around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life in the town is relatively monotonous, and everyone’s fun is often only to tease women, and to laugh at each other and gamble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to find a way to ask someone to ask what place Amon had just gone, damn it, I said I can’t drink, if it’s not late, it’s a bit It won't be as passive as it is now!" Brest seems to have forgotten that the first one to drink is him, and he still took the initiative to drink too much, no one forced him to drink. As a result, in the morning, when Amon’s carriage left for about 20 minutes, these talents remembered that there was still something to do today. Fortunately, there were people in the camp who saw the whereabouts of the Amon carriage, plus the wheel prints in the wild. It disappeared and they found this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companions saw him complaining, and they all looked away, when the guy sitting next to Brest smashed his arm with his elbow. He snorted and yelled. "Do you think we can ask something in the toilet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brest is in the direction of the person Looking over, a drunken guy staggered toward the toilet and he stood up immediately. "Why not? I think so!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He The guy around him also stood up and followed Brest towards the toilet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub's toilet is not big, there are only two single rooms, the drunken drunks pushed a door and walked in to open the zipper and pull out their own guys. The urinal, then raised his chin with his eyes closed and picked up the tune. Suddenly he felt a gust of wind behind him. The unresponsive head stunned his body and realized that someone came in. He impatiently yelled: "Get out, there are people here!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
