			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no bed in the cellar, and a place to rest is a bed. Lying on the cold, hard ground, Schubert turned to the side and could not sleep. He is a escort, the staff of the Imperial Central Bank, and it is also a middle class in Tener. The net income of a month is almost 20 yuan and a subsidy of about 5 dollars. He once thought that he would work in this position for a lifetime, and then lived a generous pension to live an ordinary and peaceful life. He really thinks so, and he is constantly striving for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I didn’t expect that reality and him had a huge joke. He suddenly changed from a party of justice to an evil one, possibly in the process. There are many factors that he can't resist, but no matter what interferes with him, he is now a bad guy, a robber. In the daytime, he also thought that if he had the opportunity to be able to elute his own crimes while at the same time ensuring the safety of himself and his family, he would definitely give Duolin a group of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the heavy 100,000 yuan broke into his arms, when he was lying on the 100,000 pieces, he was thinking about it, in his mind. There are no other ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been working in the bank for a lifetime, and may have a pension of 3,000. He once thought it was a huge sum of money. But compared with the present one, the three thousand pieces are not even a fart! No wonder so many people are willing to be bad people, not what they want to do, but to be forced by this society! Schubert found an excuse for Du Lin’s behavior, and he might be able to explain himself if he thought so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this 100,000 piece, it is enough to let him live a prosperous life, after the end of this matter, take the family away from here, change his identity, go A happy life where no one knows their place. In the midst of the future, he slowly fell into a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not only Schubert who can’t sleep this night, many people can’t sleep, and the robbery of the Imperial Bank of the Imperial City of Tener has touched many people. Heartstrings, especially some dark people, think that bank robbery is definitely not an isolated incident. These robbers may even come from the revolutionary army, the purpose is half that ton of gold. Collecting funds in this way destroys the old party’s plan for the revolutionary army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter whether others can fall asleep, in short, Du Lin sleeps very comfortably, and the unexpected harvest of ten bricks makes him more able to implement his plan. There are only two things left. The first is the disappearance of possible suspicions that elute oneself. The second is revenge and resentment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early the next morning, Du Lin left the cellar. He needed to turn around the street and look at the wind. Sometimes avoiding is not the best way to elute your suspicions, but it will attract the attention of others to yourself. Think about it, there is only one thing happening here, the people there disappear, do not doubt who you suspect? People know that inertial thinking is not necessarily right, but everyone is willing to believe in inertial thinking, as well as active or passive to bear a series of consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people have been on the streets early in the morning. After a night of fermentation, people are discussing the case of the Golden Robbery, as if everyone They are all senior detective experts who can see through the surface of the case and see the essence. There are patrolmen on the streets and alleys to look at every passerby. Under great pressure, these police officers have to use 150% of their strength to fully investigate the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin bought a taco burritos from the side of the road while strolling on the streets, a burritos like a dreamy burritos For the same thing, fry a piece of crepe with wheat flour, then roll in enough beef and vegetables, and top up the sauce. It is a very simple and quick snack, and many office workers use this to hunger in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was sipping a napa burritos while drinking a glass of juice. He just walked away and blocked his way without a single step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need you!", Xiu En unshaven and looking at Du Lin, his face is very bad, there is a feeling of guilt, his eyes are deep, and There is also an unhealthy black purple. During this time, he was uncomfortable in Ordo, although the governor was indeed his top boss, he should also take care of him properly, but this did not happen. Xiu En is not clear that the contraband investigation bureau that the new party leader, Magus, used his son's death to build, almost died because of his negligence, so he naturally did not know why he should protect his governor, but he was very cold. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is precisely because of the abuse of the power to "kill the innocent citizens" and "clay the frame" of the deceased, some people in the old party raised doubts. If there is no effective means to constrain an executive department with a blurred power limit, this is undoubtedly a disaster. The old party’s top management believes that since the contraband investigation bureau has been established, there is no need to entangle the fact that the department should be banned. Instead, a new supervisory body is set up to supervise the conduct of the contraband investigation bureau. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the old party intended to use Xiuen as a typical example to promote the establishment of the supervision agency for the Prohibited Investigation Bureau, Ernst surrendered, let the old party The motion has no sound. Therefore, Xiu’s time was not good. He almost became the “sinner” of the New Party. Fortunately, Ernst had saved him a game for him, so that he would not be too miserable. The governor has already sent people a message. If he can't see him in three months, he will lose the position of the director and be sent to other places to serve as a grassroots agent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, he was forced to a desperate situation. The only one in the city of Tener who could help him was Du Lin alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin is slowly smashing the burritos, and the grilled beef strips exude a charming scent, refreshing vegetables and delicious sauces. The cheap breakfast brought out a good taste. He turned his head and said, "Let's find a place to sit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, although she did not explicitly say it, she still showed a kind of Strong attitude. But now, it is not him who is strong, he can only choose to agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some open-air coffee shops or snack shops on the roadside. The two chose a place where there was no one to sit down, surrounded by a fence and their seats. There are a few tables off the store door, and if anyone wants to eavesdrop, it will definitely be discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called two cups of coffee and a small cake to clean the mouth of the mouth, and Shane took out a piece of paper money and stuffed it into the waiter’s hand. Then looked up at him. "If you don't call you, you better not come. The rest is yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the waiter leaves, Xiu En looked around for a circle and lowered his voice and said, "You have to help me. They don't give me much time. If they can't make a certain result in a month, they will kick me out! I don't have time. Waiting for you to compete with Karur and see that he is showing signs of weakness, we need to be more active and proactive." When it comes to the name of Karur, Xien is a bit gnashing, no doubt he hates Carroll. Also includes those who target him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin swallowed the last bit of burritos, licked his lips, leaned back on the chair, and lifted his legs. "You What do you want me to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starting the distribution immediately, Karur will definitely talk to you, about a little bit of a place..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no ending in the repair, and Du Lin made a stop gesture. "Do you mean that I want to arrange the scene and wait for you to catch me and Karur? You How to ensure my safety?", Xienen is already crazy, Du Lin confirmed this, he is planning to use himself as a bait with a bite of fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xu En looked at Du Lin, his eyes deep, "I will let you leave in the middle of the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
