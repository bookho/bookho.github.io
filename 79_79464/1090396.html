			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money arrived, Gabriel did not continue to stay, he quickly left after leaving with Natiya. When he was sitting in the car, his expression was a bit strange. He didn't admit that he knew Tolan, and didn't even give him a good face, but actually he remembered where he heard the name. He is very confident in his memory. This is the greatest guarantee for his work in the hacker. He keeps everything in two places. He usually never touches the account book that exists. The other is his. brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how he protects himself. There are always people who try to eliminate all the evidence after doing something unclean, and he needs to protect himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back home, Geblin immediately called his own hand and asked them to check the name "Tolan". It used less than a dozen kinds, and the news about Tolan was given back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the world of order, the name Tolan is hardly known, but in the underground world, someone still knows the name. As an agent of Doolin, it is also the city's largest private wine sales channel, which is definitely not a low-key to hide itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Geblin fell into thought after putting down the phone. He now understands Tolan, knowing who he is working for, and he knows Doolin. Now Tolan comes to solve this problem for Natiya. From the way he talks and the content, Natiya is very likely to work for Du Lin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a guess, Gabriel’s expression suddenly became complicated, and he was initially wondering why Natiya gave up the identity of the senior partner of the South Commercial Bank. Taking the initiative to leave, it seems that she must have found a better path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a hot character now, not only related to the ownership of the insurance business that the two major banks are competing for, but also has more than half of the land in the city of Otis. A lot of unspoken rules have been developed and the ability to print banknotes - the currency exchange company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people know that this company is also very eye-catching, Du Lin's layout in the city of Otis can be described as a classic classic. In addition to acquiring a large amount of land at a low price, the most important thing is the token company. It can be said that about 3 percent of the annual output value of the city of Otis will enter his personal pocket, which is definitely an amazing number! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many people love Doolin, how many people hate Doolin, and it may be a good choice to continue to maintain this family relationship, no matter who he hates or loves, he can benefit from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for this time, he and the Natiya family tore their faces to force their debts. In his opinion, it is not a problem, because there is nothing between him and Walter. The direct conflict and contact, on the contrary, in this half year, Walter and he became very good friends. So much money was fed in. Even though he got the money back, he believed that as long as Walter was willing to meet him, he would be able to pick up this relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gablin laughed, an unexpected gain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, after watching the car disappeared, Gatti finally breathed a sigh of relief, and she did not rest well for these days. Strangle your brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone pressed against the chest was finally removed, and the mood became better. She changed the tea in the pastry and teapot and invited Tolan and him. The friend sat down for a while, and Tolan happened to have this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ate a small biscuit and praised Natiya’s cooking, and asked, “As far as I know, Mr. Gabri is a very Dirty hacker, he has been serving the celebrity politicians in the society. Please forgive me for being unreasonable. Can you tell me how you have incurred debt with Mr. Geblin?"<br />< Br br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerberin’s reputation is not bad at the top of the society. He is a very good person. He confesses to him. He often can do it very quickly, and he’s beautiful. There is no need to pay extra fees, and there will be no follow-up incidents, which makes many people happy to give things to him. As Gabriel knows more and more people, more and more big people need to have such a person around them to facilitate their work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the relationship of these great men, Geblin has run some industries in addition to hackers, like bars, hotels and other places, and one The hidden clubs, these places have been used reasonably by him, and have become the location of many dirty transactions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in another circle of execution, Mr. Geblin’s reputation is not so good, he often appears as a mean villain. He uses his resources and advantages to force some people to help him to do things. Many times his strength comes from his previous work, which is everywhere. Some of these people have weathered the storm smoothly, and Mr. Geblin has no longer been involved, but some people have been threatened by his harassment, especially when they are in important positions, or have special jobs but have no status and The person of energy. In short, he is not as disciplined as he is, he is a jerk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Tolan, it seems that Natiya and Du Lin have absolutely a relationship. Du Lin is his idol and his boss. If Gabrin uses this debt or causes the debt to appear, the reason for the deeper reasons continues to intimidate Natiya. Maybe Du Lin will have some dangerous situations because of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fellowship and agency system, everyone has a consensus that Du Lin can never do anything. As long as he is not finished, everyone's days will get better and better. If Du Lin has something wrong, here is the death or indefinite imprisonment. The entire fellowship and agent system will be severely impacted and even maliciously retaliated. . There is no such thing as anti-micro-duration in this world, but people know that the ulceration of needle-eyes is not treated in time, and it may take away human life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Tolan’s inquiry, Natiya considered it for a while before she said it, “This has something to do with my husband...”, Nati When Ya said this, she had become calm. She felt very embarrassed at first, but now she feels nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Tolan, Natiya sat in the living room and looked at the house, thinking of her husband who had been hiding in the guest bedroom, except for disappointment. Disappointed. When she needs help the most, she needs the most to comfort her. When she is encouraged, her husband chooses to avoid. This made her very sad. He did not assume his responsibility as a man. Even if the incident itself was caused by him, he should not choose to escape. He should stand up bravely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Natiya thought that she had been married for so many years, except that Walter’s deception hurt her in this matter, he has always performed Very good, she felt that she should give Walter a chance. Slightly cleaned up and got something to eat. She came to the door of the second floor guest and knocked on the door. "They have left, there are two of us in the house. I think we need to talk about it." Talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Huat opened the door, he was not well dressed, dirty and sloppy. He looked at Natiya, plopped on the floor, holding his head in the face of pain, "I'm sorry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, Tolan from Natti After the villa came out, he got on the bus and went back to his company and called Du Lin. He said what Natiya had encountered and how he handled it. This is his clever place. He is obviously smarter than Alice's straight Tolan, and he knows how to deal with problems and solve problems. If it wasn't for the city of Styley, Dulin even thought about turning Tolan to his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
