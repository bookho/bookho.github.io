			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant director looked at the hotel lobby manager and the muscles on the cheekbones jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in the place of the Imperial City, he can become the assistant director of the police station. His power and status are much higher than those of the police in other regions, and it is not only high, but not only Level one. From the past to the present, the status of the imperial capital has not wavered. Magus once considered that in order to reduce the influence of the royal family on the empire, the political center was moved from the place near the traditional aristocratic region of the north to the southern city. This idea is just an idea, and I have not even said it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know what it’s like to pull the whole body, but he also understands that the centuries-old history and the political center that piled up are not where the cabinet goes. This core will always be here, even if the royal family is not there, it will still be here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years when the old and the new alternated, the emperor had many times of shopping, and the actual participation in the battle was not ordinary people or gangs, but those nobles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone who followed the new party took advantage of it and became a new aristocrat without a noble title. Some people clung to the glory of the past and became the old aristocracy that was eliminated by history. Some of these new and old aristocrats had contradictions before, and they took a few chances to play each other and became an anecdote about the streets of the emperor. The ear of the Earl’s child was interrupted, and the child of the Marquis’s tooth was knocked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new party headed by Magus knew that this was the old party’s dissatisfaction with their sudden squatting. In this way, they did not use the official means. Not to fight? Come, let's take a knife and see who will squat first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the game, the regional police station was cleaned up. In the face of a large aristocrat who used to be the leader of the country, the director of the Imperial Police Station is also a baron. There is no way to start. Fortunately, everyone’s anger was gone, and some unlucky children were thrown into jail and symbolically sat in jail, and they packed up their hands and tails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant director of the police station was a small police officer at the time, but at this moment, he still felt the kind of wheat seedlings at that time. The discomfort of a tornado. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Kaile has always been an international affairs adviser to both the Empire and the Commonwealth. Although this international affairs has only two countries, his status is very distinguished and special. He often enters the Imperial Parliament to provide some uniqueness. opinion. It is also very popular in the society, and it is very energetic. Many people are proud of knowing Mr. Kaile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the war, the empire and the federation fell into the cold war, and the civil exchanges between the two sides were completely blocked, and the high-level contacts between the countries were completely lost due to the war. The emergence of Mr. Kaile broke the deadlock, and the two huge countries finally re-established contact because of the actions of a small businessman, and the unique position of Mr. Keller, who broke the ice between the two countries, was accompanied by Keller. The door has a very special status in the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is the leader of a new force, the big boss of the association, Du Lin, many people may still know about Du Lin in the newspaper, such as him Aggrieved, for example, how much money he earned, for example, he may be a base, or a female movie star. However, the assistant director is very clear about the inside story. The fellowship and his agents are a large criminal group headed by Du Lin. The number of members confirmed so far has exceeded 120,000 and is scattered throughout the country. In thirteen cities, this is a force that cannot be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, he is still a successful businessman, and there are always people who want to figure out how much assets Duling has on the ground, but no one knows. Because of his special identity, the business in addition to the basics of the business between him and the merchants will be recorded on the contract in words, and the rest is a contract of verbal nature. No matter how unclear it is, in short, Du Lin is very rich and right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In today’s society, someone, rich, is a great big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, Mr. Kaile’s industry with a special political status, on the one hand, the emerging criminal group leader like Du Lin, let the assistant director return It was more than twenty years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, he came back to God, glanced at the uneasy lobby manager, took out his notebook and pen, and asked, "Why call the police, What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrival of the police and the guards looked around, which made the lobby manager completely relaxed, and his tone became softer." The gentleman wants to enter the hotel, but we find that he has many criminal records, that he may hurt the guests in the hotel, so we refused to come in. The gentleman refused to give in, in order to avoid unpleasant things, so We have chosen the alarm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant director recorded the cause of the incident on the book, and then looked at Doolin. "So, you don't let you go in for consumption. You can't change places. The emperor is so much more luxurious than the hotel here. Why bother?" Do you have to choose here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adams stood up in time and took out his business card, "I am Adams, this is my business card, please I am going to the side, I will answer your question instead of my client."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant director got a business card and looked at it with a headache. Who can do it in the emperor? Do you know Adams, a wandering lawyer? Even his law firm has become a wandering law firm. This group of people has no lower limit for money, but at the same time their excellent business ability has made them a mainstream society, especially the favorite lawyers of high-rise towers. none of them. Even if the employer kills people, they will insist that the deceased took the initiative to smash the knife of the employer. This is a trap, a trap, and a despicable means for the employer to lose his name, although the cost is slightly larger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No moral sense, no sense of social responsibility, as long as he gives him money, he can put things in order, which makes Adams synonymous with "difficult". <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant director supported the forehead while relieving the painful head and went to one side. He could not refuse Adams’ request. This is the power given to him by imperial law. After being authorized by the agent, the lawyer can fully represent the agent's legal rights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant director of the police station was taken away by Adams, what the two senior agents felt, one of them took the initiative and showed his ID "Mr. Doolin, the situation in Kailemen is very special. I hope you can converge a little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin didn't want to talk, but he twisted his head. Leaning against this senior detective, he first spoke to others after entering the hotel. "Do you mean that as an empire citizen, I can't enjoy the power of an imperial citizen here? Or because This is a hotel opened by the federals because they have invaded us, so I have to look down at their toes and talk to them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the gunpowder smell is full, the reporters around me will be excited when they come out. The amount of information in this sentence is too big. It’s too popular for the horse, and the headline of tomorrow is right. Even some journalists have already drafted the title at this moment - "Second-class Imperial Citizens and First-Class Federal Friends"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spotlight flashed, which made the agent realize that he had done a stupid thing. He immediately closed his mouth and turned back to look at it. Du Lin’s face was scornful and looked at the reporters. He barely needed time to brew, and there was a sadness on his face. “There are many journalists and friends here, I hope that you can help me in the newspaper. Mr. Kaile reminded him to remind him that there was a sign in the door book that said that the imperial man and the dog could not enter, so that I would not venture into it!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence directly ignited the accumulated atmosphere, and the positive response of the reporters also made many people around the crowd and the lobby manager of the hotel realize that the problem has become serious. Although this sentence is from Doolin's mouth, but this pot is firmly attached to the head of Kailemen and even Mr. Kaile, if you can not eliminate these troubles, and do not say his work and future The problem is that he is not allowed to go to court and go to jail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a country where the emperor humiliates the people of this country, what is the difference between this and death? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the lobby manager was just about to explain something, he suddenly flew a brick from outside the hotel and was very squatting on the manager’s face. I only heard a bang, and the hapless man squinted on the floor, blood flowing down his fingers, making him look very... injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police, the guards and the two agents immediately looked behind him. I don’t know when it started. There are a lot of people gathered outside the hotel. It looks very exciting. The assistant director said that after he was sorry, he was ready to warn and listen to these excited "passers", but he took a slow step. After someone shouted a dog thief, the group rushed in. These enthusiastic passers-by have a very strong purpose. They directly found the guards and the staff of the hotel and beat them. They did not ask the police officers on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two senior agents immediately walked over to Doolin, and when they left Du, only three meters away, they were in front of them, and I also held down the chest of the senior agent who spoke to Du Lin. The face was like a smile. "I'm sorry, please don't be close to Mr. Doolin." They still want to do it, but they still want to do it, but When they looked around at the enthusiasm of the passers-by, they suddenly lost their strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more people who understand Doolin, the more they know that this person is a neurotic, and it is not worthwhile to sever their own life for this matter. Although the agents of the fellowships and Duolin have changed their character since May, things that have not been done any more have become like law-abiding citizens, but you also have to believe that they will not change back. ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
