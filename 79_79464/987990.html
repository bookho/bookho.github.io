			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Garfield, my friend, what industry do you think will operate in the West, will create more jobs?" Du Lin squats with his legs I asked this in a comfortable room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mine can indeed bring him long-lasting profits, but he needs more than just stable output and income, he wants to gain a foothold in the West and Bringing people here into their own plans, then what he needs is an industry with a lot of jobs, a Guar for the West, and more Westerners. Let them raise their families without risking too much, and have a few spare cash to sit in the bar for a drink or something exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only by turning a large part of the western population into their own employees, Du Lin can be regarded as a stable foothold here, and can rely on three states. The land, as well as the rich and rich mineral resources, made their own loud voice in the empire. If you can't do this, it's a pity that all his efforts will be in vain. Those good western farmer who don't need you to live will not scream for you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is mining!", Garfield's first reaction was to mine. Opening a medium-sized mine may require hiring 300 to 1,000 people. Of course, you can hire more people. Anyway, people dig too fast. Those gold diggers with very sophisticated methods can help employers manage whether the miners are lazy. The problem. However, he is also very clear that Du Lin can raise this issue. He must have excluded the mining. He thought a little and said: "I don't know if you have paid attention to the commercial policy of the western region in the recent period?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't seem to have noticed these things, can I teach me?" Du Lin clicked and showed his modesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garfield smiled. He moved his butt slightly forward and looked as if he was closer to Du Lin. "The next door... It is Lepus State, and the governor of Lepus State has put forward a kind of economic argument that seems to be very new and is very old-fashioned. He believes that the 'land-opening' western region is the best way to seek a breakthrough in the current western region, and it has been given The western land reclamation individuals and organizations have quite high preferential policies and tax rebate subsidies. The cabinet feels that his ideas are very constructive, so this policy has been implemented throughout the western region."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Many people have begun to try to grow tobacco in the west. If you want to grow well and need long-term illumination and rich land, the west meets these conditions. I don't know if his views are correct, but It must be said that the cigarette industry is indeed the most vigorous development, manufacturing jobs are second only to the mining industry's emerging industries in the west. Many tobacco companies have placed their bases and factories in the west, and a factory can solve more than three or five hundred people. Industry issue, as much as there is no upper limit "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"You know that I often run around and know a little about farming and animal husbandry. At least 10 to 20 people need to take care of a hectare. Plus the jobs in the factory, as long as you have sufficient funds, you can Make countless jobs here. If you think this is a good note, I can also invest some money." Garfield raised his hands and put it on the table. "The money is put in the bank and it is moldy. I don't want to." Seeing, I have to make them a little useful, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone and Doolin mentioned this before, when he didn’t pay much attention, he was The farmer’s son, but not much about commercial farming. In Ziwei Town, the Xerma family owns an industry of 20 acres, but they only used three people to take care of these places. The three are Mason, Merlin, and Three people from the Doolin brothers. Therefore, he feels that the degree of employment in agriculture and animal husbandry will not be too high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Garfield so, he immediately realized that commercial farming and animal husbandry and self-produced farming and animal husbandry have very different performances. Driven by commercialization, crop yields are no longer the most important indicator, but instead they are quality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young chick that has just hatched may be worth an egg, but a cock that is only two to three years old, especially the mighty The cock may be able to exchange two hundred eggs for money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality is always the most value-added option in a commoditized society, both here and in the world of Doolin’s dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to Garfield, "You are a good reminder of the blind spots I have not noticed before, which is very useful for my next plan. As for the investment problem you said... I am very sorry, this is not an investment, it is a strategy. Of course, if you are really interested, you can partner to set up a tobacco company to sell my tobacco. Does the profit seem to be OK? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garfield was a bit disappointed, and immediately clap his hands, "I very much agree..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After sending Garfield, Du Lin immediately went to the state government to ask about the purchase of agricultural and pastoral land. After leaving the spring, there is only one month left. If you can't plant seeds in the spring after the spring, the future plan will be It was upset, so Du Lin arrived at the State Land Resources Administration early the next morning and he needed to be encircled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the Mennon is in the process of approving several documents. In the past few days, there was an accident in the west. However, it was a small accident. A mine hole collapsed. About forty slaves and eleven miners with imperial citizenship died. Those slaves don't need any reaction from him, but the eleven miners need him to handle the approval. According to the agreement of the farmers and locals, as long as a certain percentage of insurance costs are paid, the government will compensate them for the accidents they have generated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be less than one hundred insurance premiums paid by these eleven individuals, but he needs to compensate for 96,000. This is the first group of deaths that occurred after these insurance premiums were paid, even if he felt a little embarrassed. There are not many 100,000 pieces for him, but this is only the death of eleven people, and it has produced compensation equal to almost 100,000 pieces. The mining itself is a job with a very high risk. Who can guarantee that nothing will happen again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once thousands of people die this year, the Kadima Party can declare bankruptcy. At this point he felt the major drawbacks in his plan. In fact, he also considered these things at the beginning, but if he didn't do it at the time, he didn't even have a chance. Only when he bit his teeth, he had the opportunity to successfully win a city, and even a state vote. If it wasn't for his time being a little short, he is now the governor of the state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone suddenly screamed and frowned. He put the pen in his hand and picked up the phone. The phone came from the Land Resources Administration. He had acquaintances inside. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Mennon, the young man you paid attention to is coming today. He is going to buy some farmland and land, do you need to give it to him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t give it to him...", the Mennon did not completely understand what the other party said and gave the answer arbitrarily. He quickly responded. After all, minerals and farming and animal husbandry are definitely not a word. Even the pronunciation is not similar. "You just said that farming and animal husbandry? Did he say that he needs farming and animal husbandry to do anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, he said he wants to grow tobacco..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman’s face showed a strange smile, if Doolin wants to take it down Mineral land, he will never give him this opportunity, not only because he killed one of his men and the gang behind him, more importantly, the doorman wants to force Doolin away from the west. From Du Lin’s incompetent personality, the Mennon discovered the shadow from Mr. Zema, they are all like a group of people, all crazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
