			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice has a reason to be mad, and his contact with the state government is not pleasant, because his reasons have led the state government to reject him very much. Even if the governor did not show dissatisfaction with him, the words and sentences between the lines, as well as the eyes and attitudes of his speech, have clearly expressed his dissatisfaction with his Phyllis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, not to others, not to the central bank, or to his dissatisfaction with Felice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, also proposed the possibility of the Southern Commercial Bank to enter, let Felice feel his stupidity. As a director of the imperial central bank, a small shareholder, he has been working at the imperial central bank's headquarters, rarely to the place. First, he didn't like to run to the place. He was not a government official. He couldn't find any superiority from the local branches. There are even some local branch presidents who have more shares in the central bank than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for why there are more shares than him, this involves the competition between the imperialist central bank and the southern bankers, and the southern bankers in order to avoid being run by the imperial central bank. To bankruptcy, so close together to form a Southern Bank Alliance, which is the predecessor of the Southern Commercial Bank, they actively received the recognition and investment of some capitalists in the South, in this war of death Stabilized the heel and began to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any successful case is worthy of emulation. In the battle for other bankers, the imperial central bank changed its strategy in time for some weak banks. The family adopted a policy of wooing. Let these small bankers bring their banks and depositors directly into shares to integrate into the imperial central bank. It is this series of measures that has caused some private banks to change, hang on the brand of the imperial central bank, and have considerable shares, and also maintain a part of independence in business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Felice was not too happy to go to the place and stayed in the Imperial Capital. Where is the emperor, it is a core area of ​​the country's politics, culture, economy, and science and technology. There are so many great people and enterprises gathered here, and with these people, it will inevitably give people a feeling of floating - - I am in contact with top talents in the industry, even members of the cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of social environment that Felice did not realize himself has become his habit, which makes him become confident. Self-confidence is a good thing, but excessive self-confidence is pride, and excessive pride can turn into disgusting arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After coming to the west, especially in the west, the development lags behind other places. When he sees this kind of city like the countryside, even if Vanlier is actually prosperous, it is a country for him. There is some arrogance in the face of the state of mind, after all, it is only a "local wealth master", how can it compare with the big men of the emperor. In addition, the reason for his trip to the west was that the cabinet greeted him. He came here with a savior and with the responsibility of saving the people of the west. Naturally, there will be some rudeness in the details, and some of his requests. It is too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These requirements are not what he wants, but the plans made by the headquarters. They came to the west to clean up these messes in order to give the face of the new party cabinet now. The annual loss index of 20 million is enough to show their sincerity. They can't because the cabinet wants them to do this, they really meet the requirements of the cabinet unconditionally. After all, the imperial central bank is no longer a great deal. They are not official government. They are just a huge economy composed of a group of profit-making bankers. body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay, there must be a return, this is the essence of the profit-seeking business, set a bottom line, reasonably avoid a certain degree of risk, get more from the policy The benefits and support, without any central bank governor including the chairman of the board will think that this is wrong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unfortunately, the polymorphism and variability of things have always existed, and when the plan can't keep up with the changes, you must make mistakes. No one will say something to Felice, saying that he is right. The fault is not that his headquarters plan has not kept up with the formal changes, then he must bear all the mistakes of this trip to the west, and to do so. Be responsible for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a process that has affected his future and future, when he tries to persuade the governor to support the new plan of the central bank headquarters, he prepares and When Lito fights to save himself a series of "mistakes", he actually heard that Du Lin is secretly acquiring the contracts of the three-guarantee policy insured. This feeling is like he went home to travel three years and found his wife and a man struggling to fight, and also inexplicably own a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he recovered his wife with his true feelings and expelled the man, he turned back and found his wife’s anger when he was beaten in the corner by a man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you dare to do this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know how much work I have done to reverse things and turn them back on the right path, how can you dare to destroy the family that I managed to recover? life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he thought of the contracts that Du Lin secretly acquired, Phyllis could imagine that after he returned to the Imperial Capital, the directors and directors of the central bank’s board of directors would snarl and scream at him. He could imagine it because of his The reason, whether it is really because of his reasons for the failures and mistakes, will certainly make him lose this important job, and even someone will propose to buy shares in his hands and expel him from the council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an impossible thing. As the largest economy in the empire, the governors and directors in this economy do not have too much "human touch". "Can talk. Their human feelings are for those who can bring benefits to them and the central bank. For the losers, sweeping the door is the best choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firth in the rage did not wait for Doolin’s explanation or apologize, and the call that was hung up made Felice even more anxious. He slammed the earpiece to the ground, and the unacquainted earpiece suddenly became fragmented. Then he ran into another room, made a phone call and dialed the number that someone else gave him. When the phone was picked up, he took a deep breath and pressed his anger, saying in a low voice. "Transfer the contract you bought in hand, I will give you a price that will satisfy you. This is me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second The receiver was thrown to the ground, and Du Lin hung up his phone again. After the anger reached the extreme, he suddenly calmed down, gloomy and walked to the third room, raised the receiver, and called Doolin. "I think we need to sit down and talk, I know you, Doolin, I know all the things you do, maybe you should know about me, then we will discuss the problems we need to solve."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he did not show anger, nor showed arrogance, but his words are still not so polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of a continuous three-way phone call to harass Dulin, after a moment of silence, chuckled, "I spent two minutes to find out Your message, Mr. Phyllis. You said that you know what I am doing, knowing a lot of things, but still dare to talk to me in this way. I have a question to ask you, it is a six-eyed flying fish for you. "Courage?", waiting for Felice to attack, Du Lin continued. "I suggest that you find a technical woman to discuss technical problems, then drink a little, stabilize your mood, and then consider how to deal with me. Communicate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Felice, as you said, you know everything about me, but here is the west, I don’t accept anyone’s Threat, never!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
