			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You sit!", Magus raised his hand and pressed, went to the cupboard and took out two cups, poured the wine, and walked up to Sitting down on the edge of the sofa and handing Du Lin a cup, "I was surprised when the butler said that a young man came to visit me, because my friends and colleagues are almost the same old man who stepped into the coffin. I don't know any young people. Besides my son, they don't like to come to see me, and one of them is already lying in the grave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took the glass and held it in his hand. He didn't rush down. His humble face was full of smiles. He was a little nervous, but he didn't show it. "I am very eager to visit, I should inform you in advance."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus waved his hand and leaned on the sofa. He didn't look as serious or imagined as he thought, but he was very easy-going. He couldn't see it from him. The official prime minister of the Imperial Prime Minister and the new party leader and the so-called imposing manner, "no need, I usually do not You are as busy as you think. Except for Mondays and Wednesdays, you may be at home most of the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would like to thank the Technology and Imperial Institute Scientists, they let me work over the telephone line, saving me a lot of time and energy!", said that he took the reading glasses, then said a few words on the phone, and soon the housekeeper put a A paper bag was sent to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the paper bag and took out the plan inside, opened it and put it in front of himself. "This is the plan that Harry gave me last time. I have to say that it is very exciting. How did you come up with the word and idea of ​​'SAR'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time when Magus got the plan was indeed Very focused, he carefully read it after more than one time and thought about it for a long time. Even the dinner was forgotten that night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Doolin’s plan, the so-called SAR refers to the delineation of a rule under the premise of obeying the basic law of the empire and ensuring that sovereignty will not be shaken and changed. A more free and open business area. Some of the things that the Empire has limited to operate can be put aside, and even contraband is no longer "prohibited." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is very unique, and he immediately put Maggs in the "set". The empire encountered many problems in the economic recovery, especially those capitalists' erosion ability has surpassed people's imagination. There are many things that they think are unchangeable and will not be shaken, but there have been accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most obvious example is the navy. The navy’s top management was opened up for a large number of fears. These generals became merchants after leaving their posts. They relied on past connections and relationships to become naval tycoons. In turn, they used the funds in their hands to wrap the entire navy. Coercive empire. This was something that could not be imagined in the past, but now it is difficult to reverse it. Even if the military is willing to allocate more budget to the navy, the navy will not necessarily re-enter the arms of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of capital is extremely destructive and corrosive, but some high-level internal parties, including the old party, are represented by capitalists and capital forces. The illusion was blinded. Especially when the old parties even thought that they only needed to lift the butcher's knife, the capitalists and the capital power in their hands would actively get into the cage. This idea is ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For great benefit, many people will stand on the side of the capitalist in a clear-cut manner. At that time, once the attitude of the imperial ruling party is tough, there is no second in addition to the civil war. The road can go. But the SAR plan proposed by Doolin gave Magus a great inspiration. At this stage, the capitalists are competing for power with the empire’s regime, if the SAR is used as a The bait puts these capitalists in, and sends everything that has been divergent from the current regime. Other areas will return to control, and it is difficult to get out of control. At the same time, the SAR Government is free to make some attempts in policies and laws and regulations, and try to intervene in the current problems within the empire, if the intervention is successful. It can be promoted as a success case and then promoted to the entire Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it fails... it’s just a test field! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Otis where Du Lin is located is definitely not the only SAR. Magus has an idea to create at least six SARs throughout the empire, even It is intended that even the tax power will be completely released to the SAR’s governing officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the harder political confrontation in other regions, capitalists will like the environment where the SAR is better and free, where they are like fish entering the sea, the attraction is Infinite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these thoughts, this time Du Lin and Ha have some troubles, he stood firmly on this side. After all, the problems within the party are no longer fierce, and they are no match for threats from outside the party. In the perspective and level of Magus, smuggling or crime is a certain influence on the empire, but it will never shake the foundation of the empire, but the power of capital will! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when he heard that Du Lin was visiting, he made an exception to meet the biggest smuggler on the east coast of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a sip of wine and gently placed the cup on the table, slowly whispering: "Leader, if you go to a bottle Fill in a lot of air, and when the air in the bottle exceeds a certain level, the bottle will explode."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People are the same. We It is forbidden to drink high alcohol and make laws for this, but have we done it? Have we let the empire not have a high degree of alcohol? Do we let those people dare not smuggle a high degree of alcohol?", Du Lin shook his head, "No. People who need these things know where to buy it, and people who don't need it will not try because they appear around them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can't stop people's desires. The short-term results will only make these desires ferment and more intense, so I think we should give people a way to release. Whether it is like drinking, or indulging in ghost mushrooms, or Addicted to female color and even gambling, Yes, no problem. Why do we not give up the environment of desire, but we must be within our framework, rather than letting these people's strong desires breed something that is beyond our control?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may not know, when I came up with this idea and implemented it, I have seen outstanding results so far. Those who are gathered in Nano Lindes It has already begun to move to the city of Otis, and other smugglers are also the same. The goods they smuggled are no different from the previous ones, they are still shipped to various places, but we have got a generous tax and clearly understand that they each The specific amount and whereabouts of a business has played a more important role in our mastery of this empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What have we lost?", Doolin firmly Shaking his head, "No, we didn't lose anything, but we got a cake that we didn't have. If someone had to say what we lost, maybe we lost a bit." Face, because we have become the umbrella of those people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled slightly, "not to mention, the empire is not ready for capital shocks, why are we? Don't give yourself a lab, try to solve something that we don't know where to start, within a limited and controllable range?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magus has been listening carefully and nodding from time to time. When Du Lin finished his thoughts, he suddenly asked, "What do you think of the current group of businessmen? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
