			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's find a place to have a drink?" Kevin has an intuition that he may have discovered something unreasonable, so his tone has become very Moderation is more like the exchange between friends, not the sale of red fruits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sentence made a good effect, Nairs nodded and agreed. He and Kevin found a bar nearby and asked for a Very remote corner, and ordered a bottle of sensible spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current contraband investigation bureau is facing a very embarrassing situation. The purpose of this trip was originally proposed by Mr. Maggs to support the second prohibition. So as to tear the purpose of the old party site. This has indeed been achieved. The Prohibition Bureau has a lot of power and is directly responsible to the state bureau, not through the city hall, nor the management of the city hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some places, such as Turner, have played such a role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Bureau of Contraband Investigations on the New Party’s site is a bit embarrassing, and they don’t need to exercise their power here, like the likes of Irian’s, most bars. All have their own business license, the largest wine merchant Du Lin also has a liquor license. Their actions are legal after they have legal documents and are not targeted by the Bureau of Prohibition. In such a city, the days of the Prohibition Bureau are not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aldo is obviously the same, the bars in the rich areas basically have a license, and most of the bars in the lower town do not have this paper, but these People are not so good, unless they are reports from peers. At the same time, there is another problem. Even if there are flaws between the peers, they will not report them. Through official methods to achieve their goals, this dishonest means will be cast aside by everyone, and even lead to the reputation crisis of the gang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the RAD on the New Party site is like a somewhat redundant department, and there is nothing to do all day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men drank a little after sitting down and felt a little relaxed. Nels had never known how to speak, not what he wanted to say, but Kevin took his key. In fact, all the artworks that enter the Government House will be registered and recorded in a book. This book is currently in the safe of the Governor's Treasury. After the death of the Governor, all the keys were taken back by Vivienne. It seems that a woman who has no heart is actually having her own style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book recorded more than 300 pieces of art, including who sent it and when it was sent, but now the art in the Governor’s House adds up to less than 285 pieces, and more than 20 pieces of art have been Completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nears didn’t have the courage to do such a maddening thing, although it’s not the old society in the past, the nobles don’t even need any evidence just by doubt. The police can be arrested, but once things are exposed, he will not be better. The jail of hundreds of years is affirmative unless he can plug this loophole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he has money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that he has no money, or that he only got a small part of the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​stealing the Governor’s artwork and getting it out is the idea of ​​Vivian’s two brothers, and they are presiding over them, to Nels and A person's work is an excuse for threats, allowing them to take out the artworks that the Governor's Lord does not like from the Governor's Office on the grounds of "maintenance", and then send them back after the package is dropped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a high imitation fake thing, but it’s the original picture frame or the base and some messy things. After completing the warehousing procedure, it will be sent to the collection room. In the past few years, they stole a lot of things and sold them. For the first time, they may have been threatened, and they have conscience and conscience. However, under the generous income appeasement, they gradually became accustomed to the "poison" of the idea that "the son steals Laozi is not a thief" and became a matter of course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two young masters have no money, they will steal a piece of art and send it to the federal side for sale. Five gave them two artisans to divide, the other was divided by two brothers Vivian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original plan was to steal the register that registered all works of art at about the same time, so that even if the Governor is aware of it, nothing will happen. After all, he can't remember everything in his collection. When they choose art, they look for things that haven't appeared in the Governor's House for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can think that the Governor’s adult suddenly fell, and his power is shrinking, especially the imperial dynasty was overthrown, the new party came to power, and those who used to His people are gone. How can the Governor of the Governor take the book out without registering the book? They have no reason to ask for this thing. The entire Governor's Office is responsible for the stewardship. Without reason and excuses, even if they have fooled the Governor, they also fooled Mr. Guan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it left a handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once things are shaken, it’s impossible for the Governor’s two children to do anything. They just take out their home things and sell them. The two craftsmen will be unlucky because their actions are legally defined as "theft." The value of those works of art is amazing, and once they stand in court, it means that they cannot leave the prison in this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nears and another craftsman were careful, and as the Governor’s body deteriorated over the years, energy and memory declined, they gradually relaxed. alert. In the past, those who could not see the light were finally able to use it. Naturally, they began to pay attention to this style. They stayed in places like the Governor’s Office for a long time. Their aesthetics and tastes were higher. A square of turf was in line with Nair's aesthetics. He could afford such a fee, so he used it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s these turfs that make him stand out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin’s sentence pierced his psychological defense. He was not sure if Kevin would really do it. He was looking for someone to accuse him of stealing the Governor’s Office. Things, but once he did, the housekeeper of the Governor’s Office will begin to check all the artworks, and then there will be big events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nears was a little drunk after drinking a cup of spirits. He was holding his head in pain and swaying his body. "I don't know what to say." ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin patted his back gently. "I just want to chat and tell me what happened. You know, I am the best lawyer in the empire." With my help, even if you kill someone, I can also convince the judge that he is damn, not that you are guilty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin’s words seem to be At dawn, the silk blew the night, and he looked up and looked at Kevin with a praying look. "What are you talking about?" Kevin nodded and confirmed his doubts very seriously. He began to slowly say what happened, and both are dead. It is better to choose a way to die slowly. "You know, the characteristic of our work is to keep those artworks in their original form. Therefore, we often send some artworks that cannot be handled in the Governor’s Office to a more professional one. Fang went to the maintenance..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, there were three empty bottles on the table, and Nels was already asleep. Sleep on his vomit. Kevin put down his pen and breathed a sigh of relief. He won the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two thieves plus two thieves, which may be a joke in ordinary people, but placed in the home of the important politicians of the dynasty, such as the Governor, is absolutely a scandal. The scandal is always more than a joke. Lethality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin glanced at Nels, who was sleeping in the vomit. He raised his hand and made a snap and took out twenty dollars for the inquiry. Waiter, "Take him a bath, wash his clothes, tell him to wait for Mr. Kevin tomorrow morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service Someone disgusted and glanced at the vomit and hit a rolling Nairs. After weighing the pros and cons, he reached out and took the twenty pieces of Kevin's fingers. "I know, sir." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good!", Kevin patted the waiter's shoulder. "The wise man will never make a lot of honest people!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day at 9:00 am, Nairs rang the doorbell of the Governor’s Office. Mr. Housekeeper looked at Nairs a little strangely, and the Governor’s return to the Lord’s embrace The non-direct confidant staff in the government were dismissed by Vivi, including the Mr. Nels. However, he was very polite and asked: "Is there anything I need to help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nears said with a slight low head: "I want See Mr. Kevin!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swears that he will not drink anymore, at least not drinking spirits. He didn't know what he said last night. He vaguely remembered that he had said everything he couldn't say, and he gave the two less masters a meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is here, this is not what he really wants to do, blame the guy named Kevin, so that he drinks so much that he should not say If you say it, there are still many people who can't remember it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he woke up in the room on the second floor of the bar, he knew he was about to finish, and now the only hope is on Mr. Kevin’s Look for Kevin according to the waiter's message and see if there is any way to turn around. He does not ask himself to be completely innocent, but only to be able to sit for a few years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after the butler asked Kevin’s opinion, he opened the door, put Nairs in, and pointed out the room number that Kevin now lives in. . Nairs soon saw Kevin, and Kevin was sitting in a chair by the window, writing something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
