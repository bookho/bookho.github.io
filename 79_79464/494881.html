			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you believe me?", in the face of some emotional collapse, Du Lin did not stand up and shouted and killed, still sitting in his comfortable boss chair on. Holding a bronze lighter in his hand, with a calm expression, he greeted Graf's gaze without fear. "Do you believe me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He repeated again, Graf was like a wounded beast, his eyes were red, his chest was violently ups and downs, and strong emotional fluctuations made him feel that breathing became difficult. In the eyes of Du Lin, the eyes of each other directly penetrated into the depths of the other's eyes. After a moment, Graf nodded hard. "I don't believe you, can you believe?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and leaned back, and the whole person fell into the back of the boss's chair. I have to say that although the world is behind the world of Doolin's dreams in terms of technology, it has not fallen in the enjoyment, but it is more sophisticated in some details than the dream world. After all, there are things like aristocracy. They are born with unparalleled power, status, and wealth. For them, in addition to pursuing greater power, they can only waste their extra lives in extreme poverty. Enjoyment and entertainment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, Du Lin asked Dudu to collect Wood’s intelligence and collected it. The other party started this time, indicating that Wood also puts Dulin’s group. Things are clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no impenetrable wall in the world, as long as they seize the breakthrough point of Graf, all the way to clear the way, there are always people who are willing to show them something For example, the workers in the station. Not everyone can resist the temptation of money on friendship. There are always some people who will sell some information for themselves and for their family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Doolin is also using money to clear the way, maybe his money is not as good as Wood, nor can he get a lot of money like Wood to get himself. Everything you want. But this is not a unilateral market. For those who own Wood information, in their buyer's market, there is only one buyer, and that is Du Lin. He doesn't need to spend too much money, he can also get Wood's news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf has been staring at Du Lin, his eyes are not awkward, he wants to see how Du Lin can solve this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can understand your current mood, and I love my family very much, but love and impulsiveness can't solve any problems. They kidnapped your family, I hope you, and we are all passive. Whether we are going Rescue, or compromise, fell into their plans." Du Lin's tone is very soft, and the wording is very clear. Graf is a rough person. You can't tell him too much truth, and there is no big picture. At all, I can only say that everyone can understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you give up my mother and my brother?" Graf said this sentence when he bit his teeth, and he did not hide himself. The psychological fluctuations, eyes and sorrows, and Du Lin said that he could not save, he immediately took the posture of hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled. "Save, you must save, but there are many ways to save. You just rushed to death and they were killed by a shot." The way, killing them and having to send your mother and your brother back is another way." Seeing Graf's emotions have eased slightly, Du Lin actually breathed a sigh of relief. He was afraid that the guy with muscles in his head would rush over, and he would lose his life and let him become passive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this thing is very simple in Du Lin’s point of view. The Wood family is big and can’t stand the toss. He made the scene so big except to hope to pass this. In addition to shocking Du Lin and others, he also hopes to let others see that he still has strength. His great career is his strength, but he is also one of the most vulnerable. Once Du Lin was found to have a gap, the bigger the family business, the faster it would fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Du Lin appeared in the third court of the City Court, this is the second trial of the Morris case. The last trial Du Lin did not participate, Kevin did not want him to participate, because the witnesses or evidence appearing in the first trial, as well as the right to speak, are basically in the hands of the prosecutor, Kevin will show Quite weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a strategy for the opponent to punch, then avoid the fist and then fight back. When Camille took out the evidence he had and actively lobbied the jury, he was destined to have lost in Kevin’s hands because he was not clear. In fact, the entire case involved Kevin’s participation from beginning to end, even He planned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 9:15, when Kevin was wearing a smart suit and carrying a briefcase outside the courtroom, many reporters came around. . The spotlights are constantly flashing, and a burst of smoke rises into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin with a confident smile, this time he did not rush into the court as he did last time, but stood outside the court under the huge balance of jurisprudence and justice, facing these reporters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kevin, some people say that when you fight against the girl named Nasha and the prosecutor, your 'golden body' will be broken, right What do you think of this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am a reporter for the Starlight newspaper in the capital, and now the entire Kanles is paying attention to this lawsuit, people’s encounters for civilian girls. When you are angry, you are also paying attention to you. Do you think that you can win fairness and justice for girls? In the face of the current downturn, how do you plan to fight back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Some people say that you became the agent of Nasha to fight this lawsuit because you have a conflict with Camille when you were young, is that true?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin constantly smiled and nodded. I don’t know if someone said something he didn’t want to hear, so he raised his hand and the noisy reporters immediately closed their mouths. He coughed a little, his unparalleled confidence appeared on his face like the sun, and his tone was a bit high. "First of all, I am very grateful to the public opinion and the public for caring about the case in the city of Tener. Secondly, I have never I don’t think I will lose!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a little commotion in the reporter, which is too big to say, from the current evidence submitted by Camille to the court. Look, there are indeed many doubts in the Morris case that cannot be explained clearly. Many people who have a relationship with the law industry have expressed their opinions to reporters. They think that Kevin is very likely to break his "zero failure" record and add a not-so-good score to his resume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also some unnamed people who say that Kevin will take the case because of the fierce clash between Kevin and Camille. Kevin and Camille are both students of the same middle school, and they are still classmates. The relationship between the two initially was not bad. Later, because a girl and two good brothers parted ways and hated each other, one of them Camille also played Kevin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hatred between the two was settled, and both Camille and Kevin were admitted to the Department of Justice at the University of Oro. After graduation, Camille became a prosecutor in the city of Tener with excellent results, and Kevin became a lawyer. Although it is said that Tener is the home of two people, it is obvious that the two people who have a better way out have returned to this place. It is obviously impossible to say that nothing has happened between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some reporters couldn't help but ask: "Kevin, are you so confident?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin looked at the reporter who asked the question and pointed to him. "A good question, not that I am confident that I will be able to win, but I always believe that justice, jurisprudence and justice will always stand on the side of justice, and we will eventually defeat evil!" He was very polite after he finished. I nodded. "I am sorry, the time for the trial is coming, what is the problem, stay on the day of the final judgment, we will see you again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reporters left with satisfaction, especially the last half of Kevin’s words. It was the emperor’s most difficult period in the Great Patriotic War. When he went to the front line personally, he encouraged the soldiers to speak in front of many generals and soldiers. from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will eventually defeat the evil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very easy word, and it is in line with the mainstream values ​​of today's society. At the same time, this case has attracted attention all over the country. People are very sympathetic to that. The little girl named Nasha also hopes that the agent of Nasha will be able to win the victory of this lawsuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the close closure of the court, the number of people gathered outside the court is not decreasing, but more and more as time goes by. At the same time, Jim struggled out of the carriage door, and he put the belly down, why is this damn carriage door so narrow? ? In fact, he also had the idea of ​​widening the door, but he later gave up. When the carriages of other people's carriages are of standard width, the carriages of his carriages should be wide and wide. Wouldn't it be an initiative to say that there was a fat man in the car who couldn't even get out of the carriage door? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wipe the sweat on his forehead. It’s not good to be a fat man. He sweats when he moves. He licks his lips and goes to a barbecue on the side of the road. shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shop is called Tianle Le Grill, which is famous in the city of Tener. The best one is the grilled beef ribs, and it is not cut. Kind. Each beef rib with meat is half a meter long and has at least two pounds of beef ribs on it. It is marinated in dense sauce and special barbecue. Each beef rib is covered with crispy ribs. Tender, people can't help but want to mouthwash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Jim's favorite food. He will eat it almost every three days, eat two at a time, and drink some fruit wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
