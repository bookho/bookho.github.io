			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Prando and Schoen may not have noticed that there is a windbreaker with a circle across the road from the regional police station. The guy in the top hat stood on the edge of the street light. He turned silently and quickly mixed with the pedestrians, disappearing without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a sigh of relief and Cedore died, and it was somewhat unexpected. In his opinion, it is hard to be surprised by the sorrowful sorrow of the singer, who is also dedicated to the big guys. At the bottom of the society, he used his cruelty and bloody to get everything done. The big men in the high-level society looked down on him, but they also feared him because he knew too many secrets that were not suitable for knowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, last year, a little female star died. The newspaper reported that the female star accidentally ran from a short slope while running wildly. After falling down, the mount under the seat was pressed a few times, and the dead could not die any more. The report is actually very fair and there is no obvious bias, but it is not the first case. The first case should be the basement of a large manor. The female star can’t stand the abuse, die there, and then the song. I handled it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, although everyone is an "old party," there are different positions, and it is not appropriate to use other people’s hands to do this. Yes, after all, it is very likely that some of my own secrets will be discovered by others. But this world is somewhat different from the world in Doolin's dream. The difference in social system makes people here have different opinions. They think that one or two of the "dirty black hands" is enough, and when necessary, the two black hands are removed. , you can cut off all connections and keep all the secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plus the influence of ethics and values, so even if they use Godor to do things for themselves, they don’t need to think about what Condor would say, otherwise It is not these people who want to clear the songs, but Córder’s own boss. Of course, no one will take the initiative to harm Codor. Although the values ​​and moral values ​​are different, one thing is the same, that is, the more powerful the character, the heavier the doubtful mind. If someone knocks out Codor, what do people think? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it can also be interpreted as a "wolf case", the ruling class of the entire city is decaying, so they trample on the law unscrupulously, at the same time The law is maintained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in Du Lin’s view, even if Gedore does not enter the stream any more, it should not be destroyed as soon as possible. In Doolin's thoughts, Codor should go to jail for a while, and then die because of some accidents, as they have always done, the current method is indeed a bit too blunt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the goal is not too far away, at least Gothor is dead, isn’t it? Then Wood is no one to protect, and he can continue to run forward and run along his own path to the light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of Codor is far more influential in the gang than in the social sphere. Some people advocate revenge for the sorrow, they surround the region. The police station, waving sticks and weapons, clamored for revenge for Gothor. There are also some people who advocate that the gang be stabilized first and wait for an opportunity to avenge Prando. No matter what the claims are, the starting point they advocate is not selfless and has their own ideas. When Codor is dead, it doesn't mean that the gang is finished. Who can inherit the position of Codor at this time, who can inherit everything from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the big guys know, the tools don’t go well, just change one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a prominent position and power, as well as an upward channel may be what every ambitious gang member hopes to get, and the chaos of course begins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quarrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;谩骂. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brawl! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood was anxiously pacing back and forth in the room, his hands twitching, like he was hiding in a dark corner after his first kill. Frightened and slamming the blood that had dried up on his hands. From time to time, he looked up at the door with footsteps and quickly lowered his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to leave here, he does not want to accompany this group of crazy guys to bury. When someone proposed to besiege the regional police station and got some people to support it, Wood realized that something went wrong. Is the regional police station so bully? Is Prando’s old, fox-like dog so offensive? That is a smiling fox, on the surface can laugh and haha, and when you turn around, he will not hesitate to lick the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His career is over, but he still doesn't want to finish his life. When he decided to leave, someone knocked on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wood’s vigilantly put the vase with the flower on the table in his hand, there is water in the bottle, he did not fall, so that Deepen the damage when you wave. He stood by the door, not behind the door, because people often like to hit the door, and standing behind the door would only hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strange voice coming out of the door. "Everyone still has no idea what to do. You are a friend of boss. We hope to get it from you." A little suggestion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood did not open the door, silent for a moment and said: "Sorry, I don't know what to do now, so I can't provide you with it. Any help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's alright!", the voice was a little lost, and then came the farther and farther footsteps until I couldn't hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood put down the vase in his hand, and he made a decision in his heart, and it’s too late to leave. He knows that these gangs are definitely not civilized, and even less likely to be gentlemen. Since they noticed him, they will definitely come to invite him. At that time, they were not two people, but a group of people. Once they are "shouldered", it is difficult to leave! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He changed a suit, his ears pressed against the door and listened for a while, sure that there was no one outside the door, gently unscrew the lock and opened it. door. The corridor was empty, and the lobby downstairs was a noisy voice. Until now, these gangs still don't know what to do. The "dictatorship" of Codor has indeed greatly helped his ruling gang, but it also prevented the gang from leaving after he left him. Wood walked the stairs lightly and walked to the window on the second floor of the west side. There was a water pipe outside the window. There were many green vines next to it, which could be attached to the lawn next to the manor. There were less than thirty from the gate. The distance of the meter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned over the window, climbed down the vine and the water pipe, and the movement was gentle and careful, until the heart of his chest beats slightly when it landed. some. I patted the dust on my body, lowered the brim and walked toward the gate. There are many people outside the gate, and there are many cars. These people have anxiety and hatred in their eyes, and they are stunned by the future. Gothol is a successful leader, but definitely not a qualified leader, so it will lead to this as it is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
