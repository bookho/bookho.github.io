			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our situation in Dalis is getting better and better. Last month, we annihilated the last tribal power in the province that was not subject to control. The development of several mineral deposits in the province has also been put on the agenda..." The middle-aged man with a wine glass is surrounded by several peers who are saying something that Du Lin does not know at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although just listening to such a sentence from him, it is enough to make Du Lin realize the empire, and even the whole world finally has to open some kind of to him. The door is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus noticed Du Lin’s expression, and the two walked forward, Magus said. “In that accident...you know What, some of the aristocrats have transferred their own industries and forces to foreign countries, except for a few poor people who are not pity by the goddess of fortune, others are mixed!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus forced the emperor to give up his power, and some of the nobles stood firmly on the royal side, which is now the old party. There are also some people who follow the newly-arrived Magus, who are now the new party. However, apart from the New Party and the Old Party, there are actually some aristocrats who have not made choices or wall-to-wall. In the face of the dilemma, they chose to leave the empire early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in the regime often mean a terrible war, and these nobles are reluctant to let the family’s centuries of precipitation be destroyed by a few people’s affairs. Of course, there are plenty of reasons for their departure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither support the royal family nor support Magus, they chose to avoid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of transferring overseas, it is inevitable that there will be some unfriendly places, and the indigenous people in many places are jealous of the wealth they hold in the hands of these nobles. The field war broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that these indigenous people are not clear. Even if these nobles left the empire, there is still an empire behind them to support them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is supplies, or guns and ammunition, as long as they can get the money, the cabinet will grant them, let them go to "open the territory" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most visited place for the nobility is the South Continent. The South China is sparsely populated and there are many small islands. Most of the forces are tribes. Forms exist, which avoids the outbreak of a large-scale comprehensive war, which is conducive to the aristocrats occupying the local and stable and sustainable development resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than 20 years of "development", these nobles brought "civilized fires" to the local backward indigenous tribes, and let many still backward civilizations feel the light and heat from advanced civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world’s largest slave organization is said to have been organized by aristocrats from the empire. Of course, this is definitely the filth of the empire, the shackles of the red fruit, the empire that has been bred for thousands of years, how can it be done inhumane? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the possible human trafficking of this dirty water, the most expensive overseas aristocrats are ore, as well as some luxury materials, such as certain animals. Teeth or feathers. There is an organization claiming that over the past three decades, more than 76 species of organisms have been extinct because of over-hunting, and most of the material has eventually been sold to the empire and the federation, and the empire and the federation should also be extinct. Biologically responsible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no urgency to deny the allegations of the empire. After all, is there a federal bondage? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Some of these people have returned to the Empire to live, but there are still some who are still living outside, don't offend them, and don't have to move them too.", Mag Finally, he mentioned Doolin. He didn't say it because he thought Du Lin should be able to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire is getting stronger and stronger, and naturally it is more attractive to the aristocrats who moved out in these early years. Even if they treat the poor places as grandiose as the emperor, they can't change the fact that there is a country in the ditch. Only when they return to the empire and return to the aristocratic circle can they gain true peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that these people, especially the new generation, are used to killing as a way of negotiating. They don’t adapt to the civilization like the empire. Some contradictions come. In all the contradictions that have occurred in the past, the cabinet has always stood on the side of the empire. After all, these nobles can no longer be regarded as true imperial aristocrats, and at most they are only indigenous aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This engagement ceremony has attracted many people, except for the aristocrats who have not known about Duling’s migration before, and some very low-key aristocrats on weekdays. Looking around the entire venue, the aristocrats can be seen everywhere, and Du Lin has never seen so many nobles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the nobility, the real "new aristocrats" have come a lot. Generally speaking, they are big capitalists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of the capital that was unstoppable immediately after it was released from the cage became a distorted monster, and at some point even politics must make concessions for capital. It also makes these successful capitalists become the most profitable group in this new era. On the rich, they also enjoy the power that many rich people may not have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like... Du Lin just got ready to see if he had an acquaintance of his own, and he saw a playboy who was carrying a young girl waving at him, no doubt, Those who can make such a move will not have anyone other than Henry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus also saw Henry and chuckled. "Your friend is greeting you, don't you want to respond to him?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin knew that this was the ridicule of Magus in the quiet Mimi, and he did not say a word, "Okay, Uncle Magus!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the expression on the old man’s face, Du Lin walked over to Henry. He didn’t think Henry actually came. In fact, not only Henry came, but his father also came. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, this is the marriage of the top empire of the empire, as the steel tycoon of the empire, Mr. Knight must appear on the scene. If he is not there, the next day, under the deliberate push of some people, there will be such absurd rumors that "shock! The truth of the steel tycoon and the empire's high-level disagreement!" and there will be a group of fools taking these rumors seriously. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Knight...", Doolin as a friend of Henry, then Knight is his elder, he should of course say hello and reach out . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nate did not dare to neglect Du Lin, quickly shook hands with him, and showed an approachable attitude, it seems that everyone here is very approachable, But it is also limited to here, only for today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My child who is not a child is better than you took care of him in the West, and did not let him out of trouble. I often say that I want to see you." But this guy always forgets about it.", Knight released his hand very generously expressed his kindness to Doolin, and seemed to forget that Henry had lend him to Doolin for a while and caused him to be furious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at Henry and the little girl she was squatting, although he knew that the family like the steel tycoon would inevitably follow certain rules, knowing that this reality is cruel, but it happened in front of his own eyes. Du Lin is still a bit embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry’s original wife is the eldest daughter of the newspaper Thomas George family John. In the eyes of many people, this must be a happy couple, two similar family marriages. A small couple who represents two family interests together will be happy for a lifetime. However, the George family’s family is in the middle of the road. Henry did not bring his wife with him on such an important occasion today. This means that he is likely to have divorced the eldest daughter of the George family, otherwise he would not dare to take it on such a formal occasion. The lover appears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this kind of thing is normal, after all, the George family has completely declined, leaving only Nasha such a direct heir, and attached to his own wing . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The divorce between Henry and his wife is actually the best ending, at least the woman can get a lot of money for the rest of her life, not at some During the time period, I was violent in the hospital because of certain diseases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin gathered his mind and leaned forward to keep his courtesy in front of his elders, which made Knight very comfortable. "Henry is a very reliable My friend, I have seen such excellent qualities of honesty and honesty in his body. It is also my honor to be friends with Henry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, it should be me." I am going to visit you, Mr. Knight, but you may have noticed some news about me. I have been so busy these years that I have neglected this matter and I am very sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nite has a big hand, "Hey... these words will make us seem too strange. If you are interested, you can come to the house anytime, anywhere. I warmly welcome you on behalf of all members of the family. The arrival of him, he raised the glass, and after the two touched the cup, Du Lin went to other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Du Lin’s back, Nate smiled and shook his head, and people and people really couldn’t compare. A self-made boy can go to this step today and say what Luck is all awkward, the key is his personal ability. Looking back at Henry, he snorted twice, still not better than the better, more easily angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have noticed a subtle change in Mr. Knight’s mood. Henry stopped communicating with his girlfriend and looked at Mr. Knight. "Maybe I don't have what you need." It's so good, but I am at least honest and loyal. This is my shining point. You can't ignore my advantages because you don't like me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
