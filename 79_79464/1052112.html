			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The telephone line itself is in the hands of the official. As for who invented the telephone and the telephone line, it is not important. The important thing is the telegraph office. Controlled this business. In order to facilitate some special connections - the privileged class may never admit that it is a privileged class, but always expresses the superhuman privilege in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus and all cabinet members have special contact information, although still on the phone, but can ensure that the phone is not being monitored or recorded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Margus gave Du Lin a very strange number, and Du Lin’s operator at the moment of dialing out the number, the operator of the Vanel Telegraph Bureau saw The red light on the top of the head lit up and flashed. He immediately put down all the operations in his hand and reported the matter to the director of the telegraph office. Under the supervision and observation of the director, the operator inserted a plug into the socket at the top of the wiring cabinet. The flashing red light turns into a steady state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, all the plugs on the wiring cabinet are removed to indicate that there is absolutely no possibility of eavesdropping and recording. As for whether someone is calling the police to wait for the rescue of the police at this time, or if a pregnant woman in the slum area is struggling with the fear of calling the hospital, it becomes less important. You should know that there is a possibility of a short-lived signal conflict in the simple thing of the phone. It happens several times a year, exactly this time at the Vanlier Telegraph Office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three telegraph bureaus completely stopped working, Du Lin’s phone was re-elected by Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I attended a party two days ago, a meeting of the gods, I think there is a problem with this religious organization."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Doolin’s first sentence, Magus was caught in thinking. The name of the Tushenology seemed to have been heard somewhere. After waiting for a minute, he suddenly realized, “ Is that the organization that advocates eating horses and remedies?" Maybe Maggs is not aware of the seriousness of the problem. "What? They let you eat the horse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This joke is not funny at all. This organization is very large. It includes at least half of the celebrities and wealthy businessmen in the west, as well as government officials. They built the teachings in the mountain and have been engaged in I feel that the illegal activities of terror, I think this organization is very destructive, their purpose is not to get more money, may be some amazing purpose we do not know ..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dooling conveyed what he saw in three days and heard the words to Magus, Magnus's face gradually became solemn and serious. Tusiism, the seat of the Mother Earth, whether it is the name of the people or their self-proclaimed, in fact, they have to slag. However, the activities they are engaged in are not at all earthy, and they are very fashionable. Maggs can imagine that until today no one has told him what it means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, the western state government has been infiltrated, and it is an official at the level of the governor, not a small, insignificant role. Whether the three governors have become the umbrella of the gods of the gods, Magus is not sure, but as long as one person is not, it means that the cabinet has also had problems. Someone is blocking this message from passing up, and has formed a strict network to block all the real situation leaks about the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people today can let the governor and even the cabinet members provide them with shelter, so if one day they want to do something to shake the empire, is it also waiting for things? Can it be exposed after an explosion? If it is really that time, I am afraid it will be too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This news is very important...", Magus indulged for a moment, "I will arrange for people to investigate the gods, you should not expose yourself In a few days, I will send someone to go, and when I have a party next time, take that person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin shrugged his shoulders after hanging up The local official surveillance system may have been thoroughly infiltrated. At the same time, Du Lin began to think about another thing. Does the doorman’s idiot live when he knows that there is such an organization in the underground world in the west, if he knows Then, what is the relationship between him and the Tuss, and whether there is any cooperation. If he doesn't know..., maybe the people under his hand have been infiltrated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But think about it and it’s not very likely... It’s really a troublesome organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the western region is undergoing a large-scale "cut-out" operation, and the death of the door-end farmers means that the Kadima Party, which is centered on the gatekeeper, has lost its sole dependence. During the period when the Mennon came to power, the Kadima Party eroded the three state governments in the entire western region through threats, intimidation, bribery, etc. Even the governor became a shackle. Even if these people are not willing to serve the doormen, they can think of the money in their pockets, the better life they have now, and the life threats that the farmers will bring to the red fruit. These people have no choice but to compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the doormen are dead, and they have taken the initiative to cut off the relationship with the dawn of the blood, the people of the bloody dawn also ran because of the sale of the doormen, all the advantages of the Kadima party were completely destroyed, these repression For a long time, government officials began to deal with these people and the problems left by the door farmers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one likes to be threatened, even if the other party has given a lot of money to himself, especially the new Mayor of Mayor, who has been completely opened. The curtain of liquidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are police cars whistling on the streets every day, and members of the Kadima Party are arrested and detained, and of course they will not be a fair trial, most of them People were detained in the prison of the Vully area. This is the past home base of the Kadima Party and the city with the largest number of members of the Kadima Party. A prison area was emptied separately in the prison, which was used to hold members of the Kadima Party, waiting for them to be most likely to be the death penalty, or to never see the indefinite sentence of freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ladies and gentlemen!", the new mayor is called Julio, a developed city in the south before coming to the mayor as a mayor. Serving as the mayor. It seems that the transfer from the developed South to the closed west is a punishment and demotion, but not necessarily the same, at least not in Julio. His purpose in coming to Verrier was to run for the governor three years later, and it was too difficult to run for the governor in the South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economy of the developed regions must be very prosperous, which has promoted the role of capitalists in the elections. If there is not a strong consortium behind them, I want to To run for the governor in the South is simply a dream. Capitalists who control a large number of factories with millions of jobs hold almost 70% of the votes, who can bring them benefits, and they will let workers vote for whom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not so many supporters behind Julio, and there is no help from a large consortium. He is only a dead end in the southern city. This person is very open-minded in thinking, and at the same time he has a vigilance against the capitalists. It is a young man who is optimistic about Magus. He came to the west to give him the opportunity to advance to the governor in a relatively simple place in the west, taking the most critical step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Julio stood in the conference hall of the Grand Hotel, sitting in the local celebrities and merchants, as the city just took office. The mayor must definitely meet the important people of the local society. This is a very necessary behavior. At least he must express his own governance philosophy and determination in this venue today, let local celebrities know him, and let him have a more intuitive understanding of local celebrities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
