			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the letters in his hand inexplicably, the letterhead of the red-rimmed gilt, with two flame-like swords crossed at the top, in the middle of the white gold position. There are some sentences that make him a little confused. He could understand these sentences, but when he read it, he felt very strange. Finally he had to call Harry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can I call me, you should be busy right now!" Harry was in a good mood, and he finally put two of his own hands. The resources were handed over to the child of Nano Lindes, which made him feel that he had taken one million of his grandfather, but he did not give generously two brilliant achievements to Blaine. ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After satisfying the mentality needs, Harry also began to pay attention to the next step of Nano Lindes. Du Lin’s route for Blaren was very correct. What is most lacking is a “factory”. The transformation of Nano Lindes is a good filling of this vacancy. Many things can be produced and sold in the state, which drives the rapid rise of the entire state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has built two factories in the middle of Linders to produce copper wire, although Harry does not understand the profit of copper wire. And the market, but as long as Du Lin is not in trouble. In addition, he also invested in a light manufacturing factory. Listening to Doolin’s own statement is that he once wanted to be an amazing cobbler and tailor. Now he can’t achieve such a dream, but he can do something. Remember your past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a few words and then picked up the stationery in his hand and asked: "Which Princess Felicia is a member of the royal family? She gave me I came up with a letter saying that I would like to visit the city of Otis, let me prepare the specifications and standards of the reception in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this is also The reason why Dooling couldn't figure it out was because there was a familiar and strange word in front of Feilijia's feminine name on the letter, Princess. Du Lin’s first thought was that the success of the city of Otis had attracted the attention of the royal family. He also intended to use this opportunity to brag about the prominence of the city of Otis, even the royal family members were attracted. Come, imagine what the city has to offer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But after he asked Dove, he realized that the royal family had no princess called Felica, and even Duff had found a public royal family for him. The list of members, there is no royal member called Figaro, so he called and asked Harry, what the hell is going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not think that this person is a liar. The cost of this stationery alone is not low, and the members of the fake royal family are easily exposed. Every city has an old party member. These members are often nobles. They have a very good understanding of the royal family and have seen most of the royal family members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the monarchy has become a thing of the past, the nobles still abide by some traditions of the past, for example, when the direct members of a great aristocrat are at an adult age, they I will go to the palace to ask the Queen's Highness to preside over the rite of rites. This has been the link between the aristocrats and the royal family in the past, and it is also a ritual with political purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretending to be a royal family, it’s hard to see in this world, unless it’s in a very remote place, there may be some that haven’t seen the royal family and are not qualified to make the royal family A small aristocrat who presided over the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ferica... Princess?" Harry’s tone rose a lot. "God is on, that is the granddaughter of Lord Fatima, the future." One of the heirs, how did she think about going to Otis?" After Harry said that it was a good opportunity to reach the top forces of the empire, he immediately asked: "When is Princess Felicia going to Otis? City? I will pass when I arrive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry’s performance made Du Lin know that what was said on this letter was not a lie, but he wanted Harry didn't tell him what he knew. "You answer my question first, then I will answer your question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, Felicia The princess is the granddaughter of Grand Duke Fatima. According to the empire's past system, the Grand Duke of Fatima was repeatedly awarded the award and was given the iron crown by the royal family. She has the right to form her own principality in her own territory, so her The descendants will be called the prince and the princess, even if Lord Fatima does not What to do. "Harry casually explain a bit after the hearts of a can not emerge out of a sense of superiority described. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the gap between the mud dog legs and the nobility. Any aristocratic thing he came with, but Du Lin, is already a mayor. Even these most basic common senses don't know, it's young! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not expect that there was such a thing. He had heard of the humanity in the north of the emperor, but even the name of the princess is still in use. Let him know a little strange feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he thanked him and hung up the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked Dove to find some information about the Fatima family. After reading it, he finally understood why even Harry wanted to come to see him personally. There were three princes and five dukes throughout the empire. These seven families have existed since the illusion of the Yaoxing Empire. In the long years, these families have accumulated outstanding achievements, and gradually formed a powerful aristocratic group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the nobility is united around the seven families in an attempt to counter the royal capital. It is impossible for the royal family to sit and watch these seven families become ill-conceived, and even one day will split the empire. So after several generations of efforts, the royal family finally eliminated these nobles who threatened the imperial power one by one - one of them died The assassination of the bloody dawn until the last one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a rumor that has to be said, there is no rumor that even the royal family has killed a lot of people, it is said that a certain generation of Fatima The owner and the emperor had an affair, and the owner gave birth to two daughters and one son. The only son who fell into the lake when he was two years old died. Since then, the entire Fatima family has begun to control the family's dominant power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone said that the fate of the Fatima family was infested by the royal family, and the entire family’s direct body had traces of royal blood, especially their hair. The white gold hair and the royal gray gold color are not much different, and this is why the royal family let go of this family - all of them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rumor contains too many infinite delusions, plus the royal family sent two princes to the Fatima family for the past three hundred years. Being a son-in-law has added to people’s speculation about this. In this way, the royal family constantly makes the family members of the family have the royal blood, which makes them the largest arm of the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the people who reported the prince of Komoz in the chaos of the palace were the people of the Fatima family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until today, this family is still standing still. In the family history of nearly seven hundred years, this family has deposited too much wealth and potential power, and it is also a minority in the north. A large consortium that established its own group company without cooperating with other aristocrats and consortia. They don’t know how much they have, but they will never be less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are money, people, status, history... All the powerful words that can make a family appear on this family. It is no wonder that Harry rushed to meet a junior, the reason is here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this Fei Lijia is not a member of the royal family, but can be regarded as a princess, how can I waste such a good opportunity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin arranged the reception and began to encourage those newspapers who took the money to post new news for him. Such a good opportunity is not necessary! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, more than 60% of the newspapers in the entire empire reported a message in the second or third edition, saying that Princess Fatika, the Princess of Fatima, is about to arrive in Otis to inspect the city of Otis. There are also some very attitudes and very assertive remarks. For example, Miss Felicia likes the amusements in Otis. For example, the princess is actually going to play. For example, she and Du Lin have a leg. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the truth, at least Doolin’s move to the city of Otis, which had already begun to cool down, began to heat up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felica is not a royal princess, but is also a princess who has been recognized by the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s a princess, even if you have more money, you will be famous again. Who has seen a living princess with your own eyes? Immediately there were many people who had time to start thinking about buying tickets for the city of Otis, and some people who did not go to the city of Otis also began to consider whether to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the princess couldn’t help but ran to the city of Otis, and the city of Otis must have something very interesting to attract the big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, this is definitely the news, the biggest news at the end of the year! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felica folded the newspaper and put it back on the table. The steam locomotive she was riding was owned by the family, except for the family’s descendants. There is no outsider outside. She smiled and looked at the young man around her. "Can you tell me what is going on? Why didn't I go to the city of Otis, and the entire empire that I have already passed knows? Check it out. Who leaked the news!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sigh of anger in the eyes of young people, and the false reports of these newspapers brought too much trouble to Miss Fei Lijia. It also brought some negative influences to the Fatima family. Not everyone is concerned about where Felicia is going to play. Some newspapers believe that a girl’s travel can lead to the collective climax of the entire empire. It is a twisted phenomenon. Then, in the new era of multi-party rule, there are still people who use the name of the past. This is definitely a stubborn old-fashioned, and it is a retrogression of the times... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
