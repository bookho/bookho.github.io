			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no night in Nam Lindes. The mayor of this city once boasted of the sea to the outside world. He said that if there are three pearl cities on the east coast, Then there is also a Pearl City in the heart of the Empire, that is, Nano Lindes, who never has a night. This sentence cannot be said that he is completely bragging because there is no night in Nalinders - only in the center of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of illegal traders gathered here to make it one of the well-known gold caves, and the illegal sales obtained by these illegal traders will be saved except for a part of them. In addition to an anonymous account, other parts will be squandered by them. The purpose of life on the belt is not only for the enjoyment of superiors. If you earn a lot of money through illegal behavior and still have to be careful, it is better to go home and save peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the strongest wine here, the hottest woman, the most pure hyphae, here is the heaven of the world, but entering the heavens is the ticket needed. That is money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With money, you can enjoy everything you imagined, no money, then turn off the lights and go to bed early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron has been drunk before the admiration of several girls, most of the impulsive people will have some inexplicable vanity, Aaron also has vanity, especially It is in front of these very open girls. He frequently picked up the wine glass and frequently opened a bottle of wine. In less than half an hour, he was already drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After playing with the girls for a while to guess the clothes brand to find the trademark game, Aaron suddenly stood up, a sense of urine made him feel that he might need Leave and push the girl away to the corridor outside. Occasionally, in the dark corridor, some people flashed and soon disappeared into the door next to the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this place where there is no room for gold, there is only one bathroom on every floor of any entertainment venue. Too much toilet will occupy the maximum capacity, the owners of the bar I don't want to let my urine get rid of my guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the bathroom partition, one foot on the toilet, pulled the zipper of the pants and looked for a while to find his own baby, He glared at the little baby and spit it out, shaking his head and screaming at the songs he might not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is drunk, and the people who are generally drunk are like this. They need to wait for a while to know if they have urine on their feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an uncontrollable embarrassment, he sent the baby back to the nest, turned and opened the door and saw a guy standing outside the door, he Zhang Zhang’s pushes the man, and he walks toward the basin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Abraham was killed, the entire Nano-Rendez was circulated about the Andy brothers, and it was clear that they had killed an opponent that was similar to them. This has improved their status, which makes Aaron very proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing so many bad things in people's lives are not for the enjoyment of this moment? He didn't quite understand why Klaus had to enter the circle, but it did not prevent him from enjoying his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just after he washed his hands and face, a little awake, he raised his head and wiped the water on his face and opened his eyes to look at the mirror. For a moment, a chill rushed to the top of the head along the tail vertebrae. It was still disappearing without a trace of his drunkenness, and it was incredibly sweaty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mirror, he saw the guy who had just been pushed by himself and stood behind him with a gun in his hand. He snorted and slowly raised his hands. He is indeed impulsive, but impulsiveness does not mean stupidity. He does not know whether the other party does not know himself or whether he is really afraid to shoot. He does not dare to gamble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, he noticed that the other hand was holding a stick in his other hand, and now the stick fell on his head with a whistling sound. Just as everything in front of his eyes began to blur, he vaguely heard a voice saying something in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a curse came out of the bathroom and rushed out with a stumbling figure, it took less than five minutes for all the lights to shine. It’s up. Everything ugly is nowhere under the light of light, and many people are crowded outside the bathroom, constantly looking inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police quickly arrived at the scene. They saw a guy holding the toilet and buried his head deep in the toilet bowl. Some vomiting floated on the muddy water. Things, this guy hasn't looked up for a long time, and he is dead without accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss soon appeared on the scene. He first greeted the police officer responsible for the police. Then he glanced at the sly young man. After a circle of cigarettes, he said in an understatement: "Is this drinking too much?", he said I laughed. "I have only heard of someone drowning in the toilet. This is the first time I saw it!" The meaning hidden in this sentence was immediately captured by the police officer who was out of the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police officer seemed to agree with his point of view, nodded and looked at the forensic doctor. "What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forensic doctor went to the partition to pick up the young man’s hair, and the smell of a strong vomit and the smell of wine rushed. He leaned back and raised his hand and squeezed his hand on Aaron's neck, whose face was already white. "It looks like suffocation caused by vomiting, and finally squats in the toilet bowl."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, that's it!", the owner of the store was relieved, and the smile on his face became a lot easier. He turned and looked at the good guys who looked around the door, loudly. Shouted, "Okay, it's okay, a drunk drowns himself..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus quietly withdraws from the crowd He didn't hesitate to turn around. Although Aaron died, he was very sad, but he would be even more sad if he died if he died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go out from the main entrance...", Klaus clasped his hat on the head of a man. "If someone meets you, go away." After a little, you take off your hat and understand?", he adjusted the angle of the hat and he could only see half of the face. He nodded. "Go, be careful."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing his walk to the other side of the stairs, it is the passage of the staff, direct access to the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second floor, he saw a rest room, and the machine took a drill and changed a set of waiter clothes, messed up the hair and then re-armed It was well groomed, and a red long scarf was placed on the arm, leaving the store from the back door of the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not go to the parking lot to drive his own car, but chose to walk more than two hundred meters before he stopped a taxi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is thinking, who killed Aaron, but if you want to think about it, you can’t think of one. Their brothers have too many enemies in Nano Lindes. Even if there are no fifty, there are twenty or thirty. Everyone has the possibility to do it. Anyone has the motivation to do it. Only at this time, Claus is really too "sloppy" to start to hate what he has done in the past. Why did he rob others of things and still not kill them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the hidden dangers that broke down broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had long guessed that there was such a day, Nano Lindes could not stay, and must go immediately. But before he left, he had to bring something, such as a bank account voucher, a key to open a bank safe, and some cash and other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to his home. He lived outside the three streets of the incident. It was also downtown, the same night city, and his house was on the road. He stopped the driver in a place 100 meters away from home, then approached his house and smoked a cigarette outside the house. He has been observing his house, and he has not been traced from the front. He is not very reassured. He called a fire alarm in a telephone booth and lie that his kitchen is on fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a little while, a firetruck rushed to the scene, and there were some onlookers, which made him relax a lot. He watched the firemen use the fire axe to break through the heavy wooden doors and rushed in. The lights in the room lit up one by one, and after a while the firemen retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pretended that the onlookers asked, "Is there a fire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;front A few firefighters who walked looked at him and did not speak. The firefighter who was walking in the last screamed and said, "The female watcher does not know which dog is the bad news. It is good." It’s all gone, it’s okay!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police also arrived at the scene, after all the firefighters destroyed the door of the house, in case there was a thief in theft, then the fire The bureau may be brought to court, so in order to protect the house from thieves, the two police officers will stay here and actively contact the owner of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus went to the back of the house and opened the back door with a key. He walked up the second floor lightly and opened the safe in the study. The valuable things inside are placed in a suitcase. He glanced at the carefully renovated house, and the nostalgia in his eyes was quickly cut off, and he walked lightly to the back door and gently closed the back door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He breathed a sigh of relief, no matter who the other person is, he will definitely take revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, his face showed a sad expression. He and Aaron lived together for twenty-seven years. Finally, Aaron took a step forward and left him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
