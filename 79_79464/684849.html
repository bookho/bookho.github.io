"Would you like me to give you some tips?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tramp immediately nodded, and the prosecutor raised his hand again to oppose the inductive courtimony of Mr. 3,000, but unfortunately, the judge also wanted to know What happened, so he again rejected the prosecutor’s objection. At this point, Mr. Sanqian was basically sure to complete the trial according to the plan. He looked back at Du Lin, grinned and then looked at the tramp and said: "My clients are all Buddhas. You have a sum of money!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boring trial process was originally boring "Insufficient evidence" has already caused many people to lose interest. I did not expect that the final sudden add-on is actually so wonderful. The accused as a witness to attack the sharp weapon actually hides such an important fact, making people scream! However, after the excitement of the past, people could not help but start thinking. One is the backbone of the "criminal group", and the other is the tramp who often can't eat on the street and the rice. What kind of relationship exists between them, what kind of transaction exists? Need to give the backbone of a criminal group to a tramp? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any case in the case? Or is there a problem with the tramp itself? If he himself is involved in the case against Du Lin, then according to imperial law, all the testimonies he said will be invalidated, and the new allegations against Du Lin will also be revoked. There are provisions in imperial law. If a person involved is willing to become a tainted witness to accuse others of crimes, he must be honest with the police and the court, otherwise all testimony will not be used as evidence for trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s clear that this wanderer has hidden the most crucial point between him and the criminal group headed by Du Lin, who is currently accused. Money exchanges! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pen in the prosecutor’s hand broke with his hard work, and he was shocked, and a trace of bright red blood had spilled out through the crack in his fist. His assistant immediately took out a handkerchief wrapped around his hand, but could not entangle his frustrated heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is only a small matter. As long as the tramp says this in the previous testimony, no matter how the three thousand Mr. It is difficult to shake this key witness and testimony. But the problem is that he did not say that there was a crack in the fortress on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you think about it now?” Mr. Sanqian’s finger poked on the table of the witness stand. “You have received a sum of money from Mr. Dufu, is it still?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes one thing has been forgotten for a long time, and even things that have no impression are immediately recalled by others. Mr. Tramp immediately nodded and replied: "Yes, he gave me a sum of money, but only..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Sanqian did not tell the tramp After the opportunity, he slammed the table hard, and the trample who had been panicked suddenly closed his mouth. "You just need to answer yes, or you can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of hundreds of eyes, the trample’s nervous body shook. He blushed his face and lowered his head, letting the fluffy hair block people’s eyes from this pile. After the hair, a slight voice came out, "Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not loud enough, louder, let more people know!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Thousands of people secretly breathed a sigh of relief, he turned to face the judge, "Judges adults My question has been asked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge nodded and agreed that Mr. Sanqian shook his head after returning to the meeting. Obviously, these fingers You should have no problem, but Herr got a very powerful lawyer. There is only one allegation that can be determined so far - intentional injury. This crime can't judge Du Lin's long time. With his financial resources, he doesn't have to wait for a long time to get out of that place. Although the judge knows that he represents justice and understands the evil and darkness he faces, sometimes he must know how to close his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Prepare, immediately sued the tramp for perjury and jealousy after the trial today. He would like the place where he can eat every day!", Mr. Sanqian seems to be talking to the assistant. In fact, his purpose is to let the tramp hear him to increase the pressure on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten seconds, the tramp rushed out of the witness stand and rushed to the nearest exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not succeed because the bailiff stopped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the farce made the prosecutor incapable of sitting in the chair. He knew that his killer had been finished. He closed his eyes and had to suffer another failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, he should win, because according to the current situation, Du Lin will definitely be guilty and deliberately sin, he may face three months to one year. The sentence of .... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not willing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at Mr. 3,000, and Mr. 3,000 gave him a good smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This slut! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now the trial is temporarily suspended for ten minutes, the jury is asked to make the final decision!", the judge picked up the raft and knocked it, and immediately got up and left, he Can't stand these jerk's disrespect to the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jury members entered the closed program in an orderly room and they will follow the form to determine the allegations against Doolin. Whether it is established. The tramp who had collapsed in the mood was dragged into the other room by the bailiff. The room was used to hold the defendant most of the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, congratulations, if there is no accident, the prosecutor will not hold most of your allegations.", Mr. Sanchiu laughed. I am very happy. Once again, having a successful case will greatly help his self-worth improvement. In the past, he could raise the basic cost of a case for one hundred and one hour and three thousand for one case. It’s ten percent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is also very satisfied with the urgency of Mr. Sanqian, and he also made a joke. "Some people say that I spend so much money to ask a guy who is smart." It must be worth it. I will tell him the next time I see him. Hey, this is the credit of the mouth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Sanchi does not care about him at all. As Dulin said, as long as he can make money, as long as he can earn a reputation, he is willing to call himself as a shit. In the face of money and power, there is no question of dignity for lawyers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for justice? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is that? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten minutes was not long. Soon the end of the adjournment time, the judges returned to the judges, and the citizens who heard the trials began to wait for the final result. "The jury, what was the final result of your discussion?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A representative of the jury handed over the final resolution. As Durin had hoped before, the judge had some helplessly read the final result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The final decision of the jury, in addition to the 'intentional assault crime' of the criminal group headed by 'Du Lin', the allegations are not established!", the judge read After the completion of the hearing, the citizens actually felt that this was the most appropriate ending, and they all stood on the side of Doolin. The judge then put down the resolution and began the final sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to imperial law, all cases involving criminals are finalized by the jury, in which the judge can only be responsible for sentencing, and this is also for the maximum Maintain the fairness of the law to the extent that it avoids corruption and injustice caused by excessive judge power. Sometimes it has to be said that this is a very frustrating restriction, but if you are the defendant, then this is a very good clause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the person's card, physical evidence and arguments provided by both parties, I announced...", everyone stood up, including the judge, "Du Lin , Dudu Buddha and other members of the fellowships who came to the court, four months in jail!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a hammer, this trial was not going according to plan In the end, it was the end of the plan. Du Lin and Mr. San Qiang shook hands with force. "Thank you for your help. If you can charge me, I will be more grateful to you...", both of them smiled, both Knowing that this is impossible, "If you need anything, you can contact me. Of course, I also need to charge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, no kidding. You are a very good lawyer. If there is a chance, I believe we will cooperate again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three thousand Mr.'s assistant will be on the table all The documents are gathered up, which will be retained as the record of Mr. 3,000, hiding the key name, time, place and specific After control, he will become the principal centering in the case of a particular agent props. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a very happy client. Please contact me if you have any needs. I will give you a special price next time!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
