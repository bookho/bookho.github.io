			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one polling station in Otis, which was originally a small place. The statistics of five years ago showed that the resident population reached 400,000, and whether the actual resident population is 400,000 or an unknown. Du Lin thinks there is no. And because the town hall has not been perfect for many years, a lot of work has not started, and local people are not happy to vote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of voters sent by some neighborhoods is only a few dozen people who are sparsely populated. After the complete statistics, the total number of voters is less than 30,000. This is obviously too small. It is. Fortunately, the Empire has no hard indicators on voting. Even if only one person participates in the voting, it will recognize the legitimacy of the vote and publicize the final result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The polling station was built on the square in front of the town hall. Du Lin had already seen the polling station established when he came to work in the morning. This part does not require Doolin to worry, the Empire has specialized in this area to establish a recycling polling station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The polling stations are all active, with four rows and twenty independent polling stations in each row. As the mayor of the city, Du Lin naturally has the right to vote. After thinking a little, he walked to the nearest polling station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design of the polling station is like a telephone booth connected together. Unlike the telephone booth, there is no glass here, it is an opaque wooden board, and there is no telephone. There is only one sealed metal can. When you enter the polling station, the door behind you will be slowly closed. With the voting card issued by the staff, you can play a few squats on the counter. Then the voting card is stuffed into a sealed metal can to complete the entire voting process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin quickly smashed the questionnaire representing the new party camp on several choices and directly stuffed it into the ballot box. When he came out, he unexpectedly found that the spotlight was lit up, and a reporter was taking pictures of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled slightly and turned and walked toward the city hall, but the reporter did not seem to want to let Du Lin, followed by catching up. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Mayor, hello, I am a reporter from Leeds, my name is Alice, I want to interview you a few questions, do you have time? "She has a big blond wavy hair. This hairstyle is very popular at present. It is said to be popular in the society after several fashion shows on the emperor's side." She wore a white shirt with a dark blue ladies dress, a dark-brimmed step skirt, and a pair of high-heeled shoes that creaked when they walked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman's facial features are very delicate, very beautiful, and she will dress herself up, not at all annoying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stopped and looked at the chick who followed him and shook his head. "I am very sorry, I don't accept any interviews during working hours, thank you. "," said that he once again stepped toward the gate of the city hall, the reporter named Alice is still closely behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't take up much of your time, just a few very simple questions...", she seems to realize that when Dolin wants to take care of her, she also Did not give up, directly raised his own question, "Mr. Mayor, I heard that before the voting results came out, the new party leaders already knew the results. Some people claimed that this election is just a passing, how do you view this rumor?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s footsteps, he glanced at Alice, and if he said something, “You just said, this is just a rumor.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice was not discouraged by Du Lin’s rebuttal. She was surprised and looked at her face. She suddenly smiled. “But some people believe this, you are willing to give a little excuse "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head and refused. "Sorry, I just said that I will not accept any interviews during working hours..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Dulin’s disappearance in the gate of the City Hall Alice sighed with a disappointment. The young man holding the camera behind her also held the camera in his hand and hung it in his hand. "Boss, what should I do now?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice gave him a look, "What should I do? Of course, leave here!" She said as she walked, "We need a news that can create heat, but unfortunately he is not fooled, look at There are no other younger guys, otherwise the ticket money will not be earned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice is an independent journalist in the news industry because of George The existence of the family, the reporter is only divided into two types, one is the special press reporter, and the other is an independent reporter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reporters of the feature publication have a high degree of hidden status, because the press releases of these reporters will become "price manuscripts" after reviewing political factors. And sold to the country and even other countries. Once a news hotspot has been created, the characters in the news must be famous, at least for a few days, so their influence is actually great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent journalists are different. They get news clues and then write them into press releases for local news agencies. The influence is limited to a certain region. They do not have the same status as the special press reporters, because most of the newspapers reviewing these news articles have positions. For example, Lizwa, the capital of the state, where the newspapers are basically standing on the position of the New Party. If the content of the press release is biased towards the old party, it will certainly not be adopted, and only press releases that meet the position of the new party will be published. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the newspapers on the old party’s site will basically not publish press releases on the New Party’s position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income of an independent journalist like Alice comes entirely from the news and explosions she has obtained, and she has won two hot news bonuses so far. Other news will only allow her to mix and drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interview with Du Lin in Otis is the plan that Alice has made for herself, but it seems that the plan has not been implemented yet. The city is full of miracles, and these miracles will attract people's eyes. People from other places must be very keen to learn about the changes that are taking place in the city of Otis and the people who make changes here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, before Alice came to interview Du Lin for her own topic - "The umbrella of the gang, an emerging crime capital" <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very good title, if you are equipped with the best content, you will be able to sell a good price! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you can still compete for a news award or maybe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin returned to the office and was just about to let Natalie come over and told her that she needed a spokesperson before she thought that Natalie had left. And he still sent the steam locomotive himself. It’s not good for a person to use too much, which will make him dependent. He is beckoning to Dove who is making coffee for himself. “I heard that you went to high school?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deve nodded, her family was not rich, but she was far from poverty. Supporting a daughter in high school is not a difficult choice. It’s not that easy to go to college after finishing high school, not because her academic performance is not good, but the cost of the university is a heavy expense for an ordinary family. Plus she has a brother and a younger brother, so she was "abandoned". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Dove nodded, Du Lin thought for a moment, and told him, "Untie your apron...", Dove snorted, and the white face was filled with blush, just like drinking too much. She slowed down the apron a little, folded it and placed it on the table, then waited for Dulin's next order that might make her feel ashamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a little dazed to wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you start to take over Natalie’s work for the time being, I think you have learned something during this time, and after I find the right person, you In order to be free, Du Lin did not continue to look at her, but looked at some scattered documents on the table. "These files need to be sorted by time and content. The most important one is the first one. If there is no other need to deal with it immediately. The documents are arranged in time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you need to find someone who can speak, we need a press officer..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duffy at this time breathed a sigh of relief and was a little lost at the same time. Du Lin told her that he is a person who can't be responsible for it. It is easy to eat, but it is hard to get him to pay. His marriage must be an expensive marriage, and only those who can afford the price can marry him and step into the sacred hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Dove knows that it is not that Doolin does not like himself, but that he is not willing to do something that is against his heart. He can roll sheets with Natalie's woman because he doesn't need to be responsible at all, he can't roll sheets with himself, he can't bear such responsibility. After all, he is still a good man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doff defended Du Lin’s actions in his heart, and immediately began to sort out the documents on his desk as Dulin’s request, while finishing Thinking about what you should do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin, who was reading the document, suddenly frowned and then stretched out again. This is a consortium run by an old Northern noble. To apply, they want to get a full-fledged gambling card from Doolin. He remembers Natalie and he said this. At that time, he didn't care very much. Some details had been forgotten, but when he saw the document, he realized that it was definitely not a family, or a small company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a consortium, a consortium led by a certain family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
