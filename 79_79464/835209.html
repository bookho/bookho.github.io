			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demolition is definitely a big deal. For this once peaceful and peaceful place, this may be the most influential thing ever happened. Otis once had a glory. Before the crystallization was discovered by people, Otis was the gateway to the imperial capital from north to south. It used to be the seal of the Marquis. At that time, the transportation was low and the traffic was inconvenient. Otis became a natural “channel” where merchants gathered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only after the change of the world, so this once prosperous place has gradually been forgotten and abandoned, and this is the situation today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwell looked at the announcement on the wall, and as he read, the so-called demolition he gradually understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Hall intends to take the land in the city center - originally a park, now turned into a park plus farmland. Some elderly people who are older and whose children are not around can't go to the suburbs to find a piece of land to work, can only look for it. In fact, there are some open spaces behind the front door of every household. It is almost enough to plant some vegetables in these open spaces. It is absolutely not enough to want to grow enough wheat for two or three people a year. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These old people then put their ideas on the park, they opened the park’s land into farmland, and there are still some that have not been taken care of. The ornamental vegetation has also been eradicated. It is said that the park is just a verbal statement. In everyone's mind, it is farmland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This land occupies the best position but has not played any role. The city hall was built close to the station for convenience, but now The problem is not convenient and convenient, but the city hall needs majesty and dominance. There is no doubt that the center of the city is clearly the best place, so Doolin intends to arrange the town hall to the center of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more Deville reads, the more excited the old people are. It’s obvious that if the park is dismantled, there is no place, and many people have to Going to a farther place to grow wheat is definitely an injury to these elderly people. How can the City Hall take their land? Some people begged Deville to continue reading, but some people did not leave, and looked at the last back of the old man, and Deir's eyes shifted to the notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such scenes occur in many places, much more than the cost and cost of rebuilding a new city. At present, Du Lin lacks time and accumulation, so he finally decided to try to transform the old city. The construction of the town hall is only the first step, and then a circle of real gold caves belonging to Otis will be built around the city hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for housing problems... Du Lin feels that he can refer to the federal practice, using high-rise apartment buildings to arrange these one households to occupy hundreds of square meters or even more Many residents. Of course, there will inevitably be some problems in this process, but for the general direction and to improve the happiness of all residents, the necessary sacrifice is affirmative. A city is well built and has a positive effect on increasing local per capita income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the Emperor, the per capita income is sixty or seventy, and Tener is only a dozen or twenty. This is the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, urban transformation is imperative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people who are talking about the city, and people are discussing the ideas and governance concepts of the new mayor. At the same time, some people feel the Audis. The change, at least some outsiders are willing to come here, and even willing to pay for some houses. This was not imaginable in the past, so the residents of Otis were divided into two factions. One group felt that the new mayor really wanted to change something, while the other group felt that the new mayor had recklessly damaged the tranquility of the city. It is not something that should be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these people turned the Devilla, who was inexplicably turned into an important figure of the "opposition", to the seminar, Sally appeared again In front of Dooling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Mayor, this is a little thing that boss has brought me, I hope you can accept it!", this time, Sally came to the City Hall. Looking for Thomson, I found the door directly to Doolin. She has a lot of things, and the last time she came here, she has received the above recognition and received encouragement and praise. This time, Paisley came over to pay taxes, and on the other hand, he wanted to have a relationship with Doolin Lara. By the way, he tried to test whether the tax could be operated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also added some reluctantly, "It’s all specialties in my hometown, not a valuable thing, I can see it everywhere." She saw She did not say what was inside the old party officials who had to hide their hands while covering up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at the small box she had placed on the table and wrapped it up very well. She grabbed it and grabbed it, but unexpectedly felt that the stuff in the box was much heavier than he had imagined. He also stunned for a moment, tearing off the package directly in the twitching of Seri's mouth and opening the lid of the box. There are ten golden little gold bars staggered together, no wonder it will be as much as he imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed the box aside and looked at some awkward Sally. "Help me to say hello to the leader of your organization. I am very fond of the specialties he sent." Say, what's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sai Lisong with a sigh of relief, she is afraid that Du Lin will see what is inside, that is true Trouble. What made her feel awkward was that she had just finished talking about something that was worthless. Du Lin opened the box, which was a bit less comfortable. While enjoying a sigh of relief, she also realized how much Du Lin’s appetite is. The ten-pound small gold bar is worth a lot. He actually received it? Isn't he afraid that the New Party's party whip will pull the whip to his ass? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sally does not understand the details of Du Lin, if she understands, she will definitely think this is the usual gift. What is the ten-pound small gold bullion? At the beginning, he moved ten more in the Imperial Bank’s treasury of Tener! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiles slightly with a flattering smile, "Mr. Mayor, don't know... can this special tax be lowered?", Sai Li said I quickly explained my words. "I don't mean that the tax rate you levied is too high. Just think that we can use other... cough, name?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the name, is also the boss of Sally to teach her, when her boss knows the whole process of the process and read the authorization documents, I realize that there are other tricks inside. As for whether you guessed it right or not, you may wish to arrange for Sally to try it. Sally asked, maybe there will be no change, but if you don't ask, there will be no change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty percent of the special tax is like bloodletting, stability is stable, and income can drop a lot. If you can pay less It’s even better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at her and nodded. "Of course, but these are not enough!" He glanced at the box on the table, and Seriton Understood, this is what Du Lin thinks they have given less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there is a way to save some of the tax collected, it is worthwhile to spend a little more money. She immediately expressed her hope that she could get Doolin’s advice, but Du Lin did not answer her question, but told her to tell her behind her. Boss. If you want to do this well, you must come to Otis to talk to him. It is easy to send a person who talks about this kind of thing to make a mistake and come up with contradictions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sili can only nod and say yes, then say a few compliments, then she got up and said she must return to Nano Lindes as soon as possible. Tell me the above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also has Doolin’s consideration, and the 50% gross profit tax does seem to be very scary, but it is for the legitimate industry. Just like the ordinary shops on the roadside, let alone pumping 50% of their business tax, even 5 percent may cause their income to drop sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, Du Lin understands the inside story of this business and understands the profits of these people, so he can directly get 50% of the special tax like Howthton Not afraid of these people not giving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can lower the tax rate, but one thing, the other party must meet his conditions. Building Otis can be done by two people alone, which requires a lot of people to work together and pay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this noisy day, Du Lin finally waited for a group of people that Carter had sent. The man named Du Lin met in the church in the fifth district of Irian, called Hai Te, a great boy. He is very energetic and passionate. In the private liquor market in the city of Halli, he always rushes to the front, so Carter sent him over, and he helped him to send him a ride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your accommodation problem is solved by yourself. To be honest, even I am sleeping in the office now." Du Lin took a shot of Hite's shoulder and looked at it. More than twenty other young people. Whenever his eyes swept over the faces of these young people, the young people couldn't help but stand up straight in the chest. They personally participated in the battle and saw what Du Lin promised. They regarded Du Lin as their mentor and leader, which has nothing to do with age! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the next period of time, you may want to change your identity to appear in front of people..." He laughed. "Police, does this status like it?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of young people suddenly stupid. If Du Lin took other identities, they might not be sensitive, but the identity of the police only made them a bit... stunned. They used to be the destroyers of the rules, and they became the defenders of the rules in a blink of an eye. This shift in position is indeed a bit unpredictable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
