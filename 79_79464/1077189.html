			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can choose, the two sisters of the Hill family will reject the mission because Du Lin is a jerk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where he bastards is not what he wants to get from them all the time, but he always interrupts their planning pace, so they have to One by one, using a lot of thoughts and plans to destroy, to replace another plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Du Lin just didn’t say that, he could show a little attention to these things, then the two sisters would walk to Du Lin’s side and explain for Du Lin personally. The contents of these files, they will use their fingers to point out what needs Doolin's attention in each line of text, and then gradually transfer these attentions from the file itself to their bodies. Maybe until tomorrow morning, their tasks will be completed, no one can convince their sisters in the hidden private space, at least until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to what Du Lin just said, he said that he did not go to school, but also let them go to the lawyer to talk, then they are still closed ? This stuffed a lot of things back into the stomachs of the two sisters, and there was a feeling of being very arrogant and awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has never given them this opportunity. This is the third time that Doolin interrupted their C plan, and even more so, they did not carry the D plan. Or something like the E plan, even if there is, I am afraid that it is not very useful. Because Du Lin is almost telling them that he is an illiterate, it is far more difficult to convince an illiterate than to persuade a highly educated person, because those who have no culture are more compliant, they will not be easy. It is the most troublesome to change your goals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this may be the reason why Doolin can become famous... right? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinissa’s eyes twitched, she laughed twice, and the people in the room, including herself, could hear her laughing very much. And reluctantly, "Yes... is this? Sorry, I always thought... including the information I collected from other places, I said that you are a knowledgeable person, so I...", can't edit, Di Nisa told herself that she couldn't write anymore. She didn't know what to say. She complimented Du Lin did not go to school, or was it annoyed that the materials she had collected were wrong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dinisha got into trouble, her sister immediately responded. "Mr. Doolin, in fact, there are many famous people in history." I have never been to school, but they have become very famous people like you. I believe that you, including the celebrities in the current society, must have common points. Do you say that I am right?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded with satisfaction. "Ms. Di Ni, you don't know what you said, but I feel so right, thank you for your flattery, which makes me feel a lot better."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This task can't be completed. It's not only Dinesha's thoughts, but also Dini's thoughts. They have never seen such people. You can't figure out what strange brain circuit he will use to answer your words, let alone how to deal with those messy words. This is a disaster. He is actually not friendly at all, nor a gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sisters who watched the silence, Du Lin laughed. "Hey, I said, you are not enough. I am very happy that the old man can make two The beautiful lady came to talk to me, but what I need is someone who can report to me and decide to trade with me. Obviously you are not, change someone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Sisters looked at each other, and the complicated eyes made them look at each other for almost ten seconds. Finally, sister Diisha sighed. When she looked at Du Lin again, her eyes became and It was a little different just now. This is a no-brainer. Their advantage has become a joke in front of Du Lin. It seems that Du Lin is the one who has been performing burlesque, but they are very clear that they are only funny, not Du Lin. So these plans that can save costs are all gone, and the rest is what is related to the interests of the red fruit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, we read too many documents yesterday, so some did not wake up, now we can talk frankly, what do you want? In the empire The central bank here, what do you want to get?”, this strategy of red fruit is not the best, which means that the concession of benefits in practice is the biggest failure in their work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you have a public relations department, why do you have a special career in public relations? To put it bluntly, one of the parties in the business competition wants to use less to exchange for more. Big interests, otherwise, if you directly cut the knife from the other side, you will not be able to cut the meat. Of course, the other party will cut the meat on their own body. And PR has more room for manoeuvre and more applications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pointed to Dinesha. "This is the first sentence you said after entering my study today. I am very pleased because we can finally Take your attention back from the boring little tricks back to the problem itself. But I also want to remind you, Ms. Dinisha, this question should not be for you to ask me, but for me to ask you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can you give me and what I want from me? This is why I think you are not enough. Do you want to continue talking now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the topic moved to the right track, Du Lin was like a person, full of great self-confidence and aggressiveness. He was slightly interested in leaning forward and let the two sisters perceive the high aggression of his body. He has been Mastering the initiative, now the momentum is stronger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinissa took a deep breath and calmed the violent fluctuations in her heart. She felt that her scalp had some numbness. She didn’t know why. At this time, facing the feeling of Doolin, just like facing the directors, people feel nervous and a trace of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We want to ... part of the patent, you can open a condition, if appropriate, we can give you an accurate answer immediately.", removed The flesh has left the bones, and there is not so much artisticity, but it is the most terrible battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not directly give her any conditions, but asked, "So, according to my understanding of the words you just said, can you think?" Have you given up the victory or defeat in the court, or are those that are not important?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aggressive attitude, the point of view, this is the two beauty public relations department The biggest and most troublesome situation that the Minister has encountered since her work, she did not know how to answer this question, because she could not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she answered yes, it means that the imperial central bank has given up hope of retrieving a game in court, and instead puts its hopes on insider trading, From private contact with Doolin and reach some intentions to complete their plan. This will make Du Lin's attitude harder, and the following negotiations will be more difficult, because he has already figured out the old bottom of the imperial central bank, and does not care whether it will trigger more series of conflicts because of his attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if the answer is not, then her current behavior, including those that I just said, are all butt. They came here to let Du Lin repeatedly laugh at them. That's it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diniya doesn’t wait for Dinesa to think about it and then pick up Du Lin’s words. She knows that her sister is in trouble again, Du Lin’s gas field, The tremendous pressure brought by attitude and language is pressed against Dinesha alone, so that she needs to confront these pressures and think about the answer, which will make her more wrong. Therefore, Diniya’s brain, which was not included in the “attack” by Doolin, turned faster. She immediately went on to say, “Mr. Doolin, what we are looking for now is to find out on the basis of not demeaning each other’s decent and friendship. To the conditions that are recognized by each other, let us look better on the face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
