			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should I dismiss me?", a worker reached out and threw the sweat towel around his neck on a valuable desk, with stains and sweat. The splash is everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss behind the desk was on the tip of his toes, sliding the chair with the caster back a distance and pulling the gap between them. He looked down at the expensive clothes and there was no stain on it, which made him relax a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of this dress is more than two hundred dollars. Every time you dry clean it makes him very distressed, because the professional maintenance of dry cleaning will cost a dollar. If you can avoid stains, it is best not to get contaminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only looked up at the workers at the moment, and the blond secretary who stood behind him like a wrong thing. He is the manager of the factory, and no one can enter this office without his permission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is clear that the former employee did not comply with such a rule, and he must have come in hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he does not intend to call the security guard, it will only intensify the problem. In this era, every SME manager is an expert in dealing with problems, and those who are not educated often choose to solve problems through violent means like fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After eating a loss, eating two losses, the third time will become smarter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the former employee, Zhang mouth told the secretary, "Give us two cups of coffee, shut the door by the way.", then squeeze out With a smile, I reached out and asked the former employee in front of me to sit down. "Please sit down. I don't know what happened. I don't know where the problem is. Don't be excited, let us figure things out. Then I will give you an answer." He chose the most appropriate way, and the process of narrating the problem will calm the emotional staff and then be more rational, which provides the necessary elements to solve the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the employee’s account, the manager understood what happened. Simply put, the worker was fired and the person in charge of the work arrangement did not Tell the question clearly to him, tell him directly that he was fired by the company, and he can pack things and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made the workers very angry. He worked for two years because of this company. This is not a short-term job. According to the current agreement between the workers' union and the entrepreneurs, after two years of construction, the company will give workers more benefits and better treatment. He thought that the company cleaned him up for these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after explaining it by the manager, he knew that it was not only him who was fired, but also some others. The main reason is that because of the war, many raw materials are in short supply, and the company must choose to let some workers temporarily leave their jobs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager then told the worker that he was chosen because he learned from his family’s situation that he is better off than other workers. More, he will not be living on the streets if he loses his job temporarily, and he will not have no food. The company is willing to write the best comments for him on his resume and take the initiative to help him find his next job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing these situations, the worker’s expression was much more soothing. He nodded and sighed. “You said it makes sense, sir. I know that there are many colleagues whose family situation is very bad... Although I have some reluctance in my heart, this is the best choice. I support the company’s practice. If...", at this time his face showed some The embarrassing look, "If possible, when the war is over, the company's situation is getting better, I still want to come back to work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes,” the manager said in a very firm tone. “As long as our situation improves, we will definitely hire you back. After all, you have made outstanding contributions to the company and are very skilled workers. This is for us. Production is very important." Speaking of this, after thinking about it, he took out ten dollars from his pocket and took the initiative to stand around the table and walk to the worker's side, and put the money into his pocket. "This is I can't take care of all of you for the company. You must accept it when you arrive and apologize."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worker suddenly became furious and stood up and threw the money on the ground. "You What is this? You are humiliating me. Although I am just an ordinary working class, I am also dignified..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the workers leaving On the back, the manager snorted and bent down to pick up the ten dollars on the ground, and bounced, and the crisp voice made him intoxicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and asked the secretary to find the head of the responsible worker's work, intending to teach a little experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for actually dismissing these workers is not what the manager said, purely because they have found some cheaper workers, those migrant workers. According to the current standards of the Imperial Social Services Department, the monthly salary of the Western working class is 47 and 65, which is seven less than the minimum wage of the southern workers, and 15 in some industries. Mainly because the price level in the west is lower than in the south, this standard was formulated with the assistance of the workers' union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, these two-year workers have reached the first year of service-age benefits, and if they continue to hire these workers, they must not only give them more benefits, For example, a half-year medical examination, paid holidays, etc. In terms of wages and salaries, it is increased by 5% every year. At the end of each year, a bonus is needed. The number of bonuses is determined by the company itself, at least one dollar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When factory companies use these skilled workers again, the cost will start to increase sharply, so the mobility of workers in small and micro enterprises is very strong, almost no Can work in a company for a long time. Only those skilled workers who work hard and know how to manage interpersonal relationships can become the iconic figures of “old and new” and stay in the company to enjoy various minimum standards of benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s not that all companies will do this. Some medium-sized companies and large enterprises are just the opposite of these small and micro enterprises. They are willing to improve the treatment of workers. Keep these skilled workers. The profit that a skilled worker adds to the enterprise far exceeds the wealth they get from the enterprise. This is actually a phenomenon or a problem of the enterprise itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of profit points, product manufacturing technology requirements are low, a large number of jobs are duplication of labor, this phenomenon is more common. Because new workers don't need any skills to get into the job, they may just be numb and stand by the assembly line to do the work that anyone can do. There is little difference between new and old employees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big companies are different, they have enough profits, and the products produced have certain technical thresholds, not all workers can get started as soon as they enter the factory, so They need and have enough capital to retain skilled workers. The difference between the two polarizations is, in the final analysis, still on the issue of business management. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the end, the problems of the company itself make the workers pay the bill, after all, the workers are the real vulnerable groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the end of the story, then it really ends here, but there has been a small accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
