			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Juan’s assets were frozen. The first thing that was hit was the buddy he hired. It’s not easy to survive in Irian’s. Suddenly he lost a copy of it. The work of a lifetime has made these people feel bad. No one knows when Mr. Juan’s assets can be thawed. If they find a work workshop and a bar outside, they can operate. Are they coming back or not coming back? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you come back, you must be offended, and you may have to pay a part of the penalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not coming back? If Mr. Juan is anxious to start a new job, isn’t he saying that they are going to lose their stable jobs? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a headache. It’s even more troublesome. The winter break is coming. This month’s salary has not yet been sent, which means They may have to do some temporary workers with very low pay during the two months before the winter break. In the next winter break, they may have to go hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not a way to stay here, leaving a person waiting for news here, we go to the port to see if there are any better temporary workers to do. "And it's the manager of the workshop, Rhodes. He is sixty years old this year. He has been here with Juan for a lifetime. It is also a kind of highly respected person. With his words, young people are heading towards the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The port at this time is still hot in the summer when the weather is hottest? The damp sea breeze with the autumn chill, even if you wear more clothes, you can't stop the coldness. There are not many sloppy businessmen on the empty pier. The merchants have begun to withdraw at this time, and they will come back after the spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large group of people suddenly appeared on the dock and attracted a lot of attention. Immediately, some businessmen ran over to sell their own goods. The price was almost three times lower than before. One of the parts. The return of these goods not only requires a large amount of tolls, but also squeezes the liquidity of the merchants. By the time of the spring of next year, the goods in their hands may have fallen, and the three-way toll is estimated to be one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s better to cut prices, even if you don’t make money, it’s better than losing money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you recruit people to work? The kind of salary day!", Rhodes is the oldest and has the highest status among the group. He first On behalf of everyone asked this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enthusiasm used by merchants like the tides has retreated. Many people shake their heads and leave, but some people have stayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a businessman who sold furniture and asked: "How much do you plan to spend a day on hard work?" Several workers discussed with Rhodes for a while. Given a five-day wage, the businessman shook his head. "It's too expensive. You can only give you one or two. If you are willing to do it, leave someone down. If you don't want to do it, please."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really hard to accept 20% of the burns. The money they want is actually not high. Some people leave with anger, but some people stay. Come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you need us to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businessman smiled and pointed at the pier The goods wrapped in canvas like a hill said: "Go these things to the fifth district, how to send them to your own solution, ten people in three days!", these furniture are obviously not worthwhile, compared to the front The spending power of the fifth district in the three districts is more prominent in this family's necessary display. Rhodes just glanced at him, "How is it possible? Even with a truck, it takes a day, and you don't have a truck yet." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you not do?", the businessman did not care about swearing. "If you don't do it, we will find the hard work on the dock. The price is the same. They don't have it." So much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the heavy goods like a hill, Rhodes can only sigh, three days for three days, at least Solve some people's eating problems during this time. He turned to look at the strong guys behind him. "Whoever is tight, whoever comes first, everyone will understand each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several guys are a little embarrassed And the embarrassment stood out from the crowd and talked with the merchants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon this group of people was divided into two, but Rhodes did not work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a middle-level cadre under Hu’s, and he’s still a bit worthy. He lives in the fourth district and does not miss the salary of the two months. . He was worried about the young boys, they had no savings, and they used money at home, so he stayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as he sighed and was about to leave, the left-behind guy gasped and ran over. He stopped in front of Rhodes, his hands pressed his knees, bent over, gasping, pointing to the place where he said: "There is someone looking for you, Grandpa Rhodes."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhodes’s face flashed and he hurriedly asked, “Is it a grandfather of Juan?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The guy gasped a little and straightened his back and shook his head and replied: "No, it’s Mr. 350,000!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When James knows Hu An’s assets were sold to Du Lin immediately after they were frozen, and they were sold at market prices without any discount. James indicated that he could give less, but Du Lin did not. Money has a lot of magic. When you have nothing unexpected, any money is normal and legal. But when someone wants to give you a little color to see if you are in trouble, even if you give less than one dollar, you may become an excuse. There is no data in the short sentence below the market price. You can see this short sentence. Everyone knows what this means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that Du Lin got the liquor license was to restore the brewing of the wine as soon as possible. He used to import the wine from the federal government. The method of brewing is not clear, so he has to recruit these skilled workers from Juan to his own knees. He has no time to hire new people one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhodes saw Mr. 350,000 when he was outside the door of their workshop, and Du Lin was looking through the window at the equipment, Rhodes Sri Lanka took a light footstep and walked over, but it was not so light that he could not hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there anything that Irian can sell?" Du Lin pointed to the equipment used for winemaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhodes didn’t know what Du Lin meant, but he knew he couldn’t afford to be a rich man and nodded very respectfully. “Most of these things. You can buy it, except for a few homemade things that you can't buy, but you can also find a blacksmith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded, able Just bought it, he turned back and reached out and took the initiative with Rhodes. "You are Rhodes? I heard about you." Du Lin heard that this is not a hypocrisy, he is I really heard about this guy. He was a friend of Juan. He was an apprentice in the workshop. He later took the workshop owner’s industry and made the boss very coincident with the accident. He took over the workshop and his former “colleagues”. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people were driven away by him or dismissed, but Rhodes did not. Rhodes is a very real person, and there is no such thing as a flower. If such a person starts a business, it is dead, but it is not bad. In these years, Juan completely let go of Rhodes to manage his workshop. It can be said that half of the money in his hands is actually earned by Rhodes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are big people who compliment themselves, Rhodes also feels that there is a face on his face. After he humbly said that it was the appreciation of others, he asked Du Lin’s intentions. "You mean... Mr. Juan is finished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled twice, didn't say yes, didn't accept it, but his attitude has It shows everything. “Huan mortgaged the workshop and the bar to the imperial central bank. Now his assets are frozen and they cannot redeem these workshops and bars within the stipulated date, so these things are already banking things. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Redston was flustered, and he wouldn’t do other things for a lifetime of winemaking. His son and son-in-law are also under his hands. Workers, this family will only make wine. Suddenly hearing this news is not to say that the family has to be unemployed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is very satisfied with the change in Rhodes's expression. He likes people who don't have a city, so he is very happy to make his own words clear, "I I bought a liquor license from the bank and planned to continue to make wine and sell wine. I don’t know much about this trip, so I need skilled and reliable workers. They recommended you to me. I don’t know if you would like to work for me? Salary In terms of the number given to you by Juan, it is a weekly result."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Rhodes is full of his own family unemployed, heard Du Lin This is like a swimming athlete who drowns in a line that sews clothes, and wants to climb up the line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhodes’s delight, “Of course I am willing, this is my pleasure, Mr. Doolin!”,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Rhodes's help, Du Lin quickly taught things to Rhodes. His only requirement was that the winery must be large, the output must be high, and you must get rid of the "workshop". Scale and production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing to object to Rhodes. Anyway, a barrel of wine is also brewed. One hundred barrels and ten thousand barrels are also brewed. He immediately asked people to call the workers and discuss the problem of building the factory with Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
