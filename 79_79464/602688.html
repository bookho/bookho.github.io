			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are always saying how successful people are, as if the winners were born with some great things to come to the world, but that is not the case. The so-called personality charm and shrewd mind are actually based on the recognition of money by society. We often say that a certain entrepreneur is very powerful, but it ignores that there are still ninety-nine former entrepreneurs who are struggling to go to the streets to find food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize this successful entrepreneur – the number behind the status and the money, the bigger the number, the more we will affirm him It is firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So no matter what Du Lin said, he is right in the eyes of those whose numbers don’t have many numbers, because he succeeded, we are always convinced The winner, because we have not succeeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the goal, this is the role model! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A batch of private wine was packed and bound into wooden boxes with solid wooden boards. The car is full of private wines running on the roads of the city. A bucket of low-alcohol wine falls down, but the banknotes flow out. More and more low-grade wines gather here, and more and more banknotes enter. Du Lin was in the bank's account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There I have to talk about a little anecdote here, some people have been reminding Du Lin that the Imperial Central Bank can’t stand it because it’s the bank opened by the Ogdin people. He should hide his money in the cellar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, this is a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of high-quality private wines have successfully hit the market, so the other two guys have not been very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only six people in the quiet restaurant, two attendants, two bodyguards, and two tycoons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernst is sitting at the end of the long table, elegantly and calmly dividing the steaks in the plate, the good steaks, and the inferior people. Not a thing. Cattle are cheap, but there are also expensive luxury items that are specially supplied to nobles and capitalists. These cows eat far better than some middle-class families, and in order to make the fat perfectly dispersed in the muscles, not one piece, each high-quality Wagley has a team of at least three people. Come to raise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will feed the cows to eat some expensive fruits and also eat some other quality beef for them - this will increase the amino acid content of the beef and increase the freshness of the beef. They will also regularly massage these cows to make the excess fat that may be produced and then evenly fill the meat. Of course, every cow needs to exercise. Their daily life is just like the nobles of the nobility, and they will be dealt with when they are needed to become the food in the dish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an almost perfect steak, which costs about 60 to 70 yuan per pound. If it is the top special beef, the price will be as high as hundreds. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernst is like a foodie, patiently and carefully, the outer layer is slightly burnt, and some pink beef pieces are cut from the whole. Insert a silver fork into the beef block and squeeze a pink juice out of it. He carefully leaned forward and leaned forward, stretched his neck, wrapped the beef pieces into his mouth, nodded, and encouraged the gang to chew. He looked up at the guy across the table, swallowed the beef in his mouth, and raised the knife and fork in his hand. "Don't you taste it? It's very fresh, it was slaughtered this morning."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karl's upper lip twitched twice, making him look a bit funny, his expression was serious and sensational, his eyes filled with horrible luster. He lowered his gaze and glanced at the steak with a seductive scent on the plate, then held the napkin in a ball and threw it on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand how you can eat it. Don't you know that our market share is shrinking? The daily income is constantly decreasing. We should stop the madman, at least not let him mess up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karur said that there is a recent market price reduction for snow elves and first love. The problem is that the price of each bottle is not much, but it has only dropped by 50%, but this five-year-old has made more bars more willing to promote these two kinds of private wines when selling high-alcohol. First, the quality is high-end, while the purchase price is at the low-end. On the other hand, the customer's reputation is rapidly fermenting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more bars are falling out - bars are cash cows, and bar holders don’t care what the rules are, they need profits and markets. Others don't care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernst is not very concerned about the gains and losses on private wine because of the complex background, or he can maintain his demeanor from his confidence to stand To the end. However, Karur did not. Recently, the income has been decreasing while the expenses have been decreasing. Some people have already warned him by laughing and laughing. If the contribution is to be reduced, he will consider changing someone to support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
