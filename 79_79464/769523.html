			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s way back is always pondering the words of the mayor’s adult. There is a message in his words. Some people are dissatisfied with Du Lin’s recruitment method. Brewing an event like a demonstration. As a tourist city, if such news is not a good thing, people will question the stability and security of Irian. Some tourists who plan to travel will temporarily put down their plans and choose to wait and see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either Doolin handles this matter well, or the City Hall handles it. There is no doubt that if the City Hall is to deal with it, it is very likely that both sides will criticize it. Then give a solution to the mud and solve it. But this is not what Du Lin wants. He doesn't want his workers to have a group of provincial people or other ethnic groups. He doesn't have a high degree of education. He has always been a bystander in another world, but he remembers that someone said such a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a pure team has combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the manor, Du Lin immediately arranged a job for Ellis, and he took Savi to the fifth district to find a way to investigate. Who is going to drag his hind legs. Find those who plan this action, list their lists, and don't miss any of them as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice quickly left Savi and his friends, and they all sat down and asked, "I don’t quite understand." Boss, is it a bit too much to pay attention to this matter? But it is a group of provincial people who want to work. It is almost enough to teach them a meal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head. "Oh, this is the biggest difference between the Guar and the provincial sages that I often say. The Guarts do not contend, and they accept it. The war and the following environment have caused many Guars to lose. Bold, but look at the provincial people, no matter how badly they are treated and the environment they live in. They are constantly fighting and constantly robbing. So now the social status of the provincial sage is better than that of Guart. "There are many people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They still retain the animal-like wildness, and what they did made the empire feel pain, so the empire gave them better Treatment, a better environment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This may be just There is nothing wrong with a small thing, but it is not necessarily impossible to turn into a big thing. The collapse of many forces begins with small things, if this time they make a big news and let the eyes of the entire empire focus on Irian, Do you think it is a small thing or a big thing? So the mayor said it was right, and you have to press these thorns anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On my site, I have to listen to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Totto is coming very fast, he is carrying a canvas bag. The canvas bag at the beach is particularly popular, mainly because it is more waterproof than other materials. The moisture on the beach is very heavy. The material such as cotton has a wet feeling when it is backed up. The things inside it will also have a degree of moisture. The canvas bag has no such problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out six books from his bag, each of which was packed with two hundred names, their home address, family information, etc. It was Totti’s worker who was recruited for Du Lin. Old Totti was obviously very upset and his work was very hard. After he introduced some of them to Doolin, Du Lin raised his hand and prevented him from continuing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Totti, I think I already understand, thank you very much for your help, but I have a little thing to ask.", Totti stunned. After a while, he sat back and waited for Doolin’s inquiry. Du Lin slowed down his speech as much as possible, so that Totti could not hear clearly. “Mr. Totti, during this time, there is no provincial or Others come to work, after you reject them, does anyone say something that is not so good? Or threatened you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Totto look When he got so heavy, he nodded. "There is indeed, Mr. Doolin’s conditions are really too good. Even my old man can’t help but want to go to work, let alone those young people? There are provincial people to ask about recruitment, and there are several barbarians in the north who have come. I have rejected them. There is a provincial sage named Micchi who said something very rude, I heard that they seem to want to use something. Ways to contact you directly. Why, are they..."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin waved his hand and stood up. He reached out and gave Totti a grip. "Thank you for your hard work during this time. I have left you a supervisor at the construction site." Location, your children can go to work on the job site if they like, thank you very much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Totto and Du Lin shook hands and took a face The confusion left, he did not understand why Du Lin was so interested in this issue, and even let people drive him to pick him up and send him back. He wondered if the provincial sages had contacted Doolin. If it really didn't work, it would not be impossible to give up three or five hundred places. In this way, Totti with doubts returned to the fifth district, he may not know, a storm is brewing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the provincial sages in the fifth district are very dissatisfied with Du Lin’s recruitment plan. They think that the provincial sages have far more social status and work ability than the half-dead guates. If only one or two people are dissatisfied with this, there may be no problem, but when many provincial people know Duulin's recruitment standards and are told that only the Guars can apply, the group of people who jumped up and down were angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why can only the Guar people go there to work, why can't we?", Mickey looked at the compatriots sitting around the campfire With fists, "more than the basic salary required by the workers' union, two meals that can be eaten, and even one day a week, so that the quality of the job should be open to all good people, not just the Guar. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mickey, who has worked at the dock for a long time, is familiar with the troublemaker. He responded to the workers’ union and Dulin’s presence in recruiting Discrimination, while calling on some compatriots who are equally resentful, intends to make a demonstration to protest Dulin’s discrimination against the provincial sage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told everyone that his request is not high, give himself a management job and give himself two thousand places, he can calm himself up. protest activity. From the very beginning, Mickey’s purpose was to serve his own interests. At the same time, he hoped that he could raise his position in the province of the fifth district and make himself a person like “Abigien”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people think that Abigail is shameful, but some people think that Abigail is worth learning, although he may have taken a lot of money. He also did a lot of things for everyone. Everything is divided into two sides. Abien is wrong in that he has obtained economic benefits and greedily wants fame and status, so it has caused people to be disappointed with him, so that he is cast aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t consider the question of fame, maybe Abigail is still the one who everyone praises, but everyone won’t like him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mickey slightly lost his mind for a moment, and the bonfire printed his face red, his face was somewhat distorted, "If you are not willing to be Discrimination, on the last day of the week, we went to the San Francisco’s manor outside the demonstration!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting on a side of a relatively older provincial Scratching the head, "What if the 3,500,000 Mr. does not compromise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't compromise? Then we will make trouble every day, and make him compromise!" Mickey's muscles relaxed on his face. He clap his hands. "Don't worry about this problem, those who have money are more likely to face than you can imagine. They will definitely compromise and will compromise in the first place. I hope that everyone will be able to go together this weekend. After I have found him to be in our job, everyone who goes with me has a share! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps under the temptation of a three-year, well-paid job, some people who are still hesitant blindly nodded under the group consciousness. They never seem to think about things that might not be possible. Mickey thinks things too simple, and there are some things that people can do, not just a shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mickey and a few well-connected people left after the meeting, they have other things to say, small circles, so no one else here And are not eligible to participate. When there was no one, Mickey checked around and made sure that there was no one around him. He lowered his voice. "Brothers, want to make big money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mickey's friends are all playing at the door of his family from childhood, because there is no culture, learning is not good, leaving the school to hang out early, now can only be regarded as the bottom of society. Some of them have mixed gangs, and some have done robbery. When they were young, Mickey did not do much. After leaving the dock some time ago, he realized that if there is no other way to quickly accumulate the first funds, he may always be a bottom of society, the garbage of those rich people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he thought of a plan, a plan that was risky, but would definitely be rich after success - kidnapping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His purpose is Mr. 350,000. The reason why the goal is set to 350,000 is mainly because Du Lin is a Guar. In this Ogildin-led empire, the Guarts are gualts and are always inferior. Even if Mr. 350,000 has an accident, people may pay attention to it for a while, but they will not pay attention after a while. The intensity of the arrest of the empire will not be too great. Although Mr. 350,000 has money, many Oging people can see him unhappy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His idea was to use the demonstrations to get negotiating power, and then they would be able to enter the estate of Mr. 350,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
