			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be sure to find out who is behind us in the back." Du Lin thought for a moment and said: "I will immediately put down some unimportant work, I have a few suggestions for investigating the clues of these people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, the power to take out so many pistols in one breath is definitely not a small one. Forces, and I think these people are most likely not Guri people, people from other places. If there is a gang in Guri that can take out so many weapons in one breath, it is impossible that the gangs are still in the middle of the battle. They have the strength to unify the underground world of Guri. But this is only my suggestion, not to say that Guri City does not need to check, just check it carefully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Secondly, I remember that I asked you to make a mark on the power cabin. Did you do it?” When Doolin bought the truck, he asked Ellis to engrave some marks on the seams of the power cabin. Trucks, other parts of vehicles, are consumables, often In other words, except the power compartment will not be replaced. The purpose of this is to be able to visually distinguish between your own car and someone else's car in some cases, and now it is just right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha’s side nodded, and Du Lin continued: “Let’s take a look at the places where you buy trucks and go to the surrounding cities. If you find our car, don't alarm the other party, let's talk about the man's hand first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Third, our The truck is full of cargo, I believe that as long as those trucks are driving on the road, they will leave traces of the wheels. Take the hands and go to the scene, follow the wheel traces and see where the two cars have gone." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fourth, the value of more than 30,000 pieces of goods, the other party may not be the first time, but the time will not be long. People stare Around the market, see where other people are shipping, find them, follow them and see who they are!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin patted the palm of his hand "Move it up, do it now, if you don't have enough people, hire someone from the street! I will see two other guys. I hope they can be smarter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not long after Dufo’s departure, Du Lin’s departure, he needs to explain the situation to the two partners, hope They are not stupid and can't even see the true and false. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first stop of Dooling was Ernst's home. The reason why Ernst chose Ernst is that this guy's main business is not private wine, but another kind of more illegal things, of course, the profits are even bigger. More importantly, Ernst is a wise man. He is better than Carroll's temper and can think about it. This is the key. As long as Ernst can believe that Doolin is not black and black, then when two people go to persuade Karur, whether they believe in it or not, they must believe the words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he is facing two other more powerful opponents, if you don’t want to be kicked out by Duolin and Ernst, even if it’s really black Black, he must also recognize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernst was very surprised and welcome to Doolin’s visit. To be honest, I have never had the opportunity to make money without worrying about it. He doesn't need to have any troubles. Everything is handed over to Doolin's people to work, and then he waits for dividends every week. In the past, he could not see the profit of private liquor because the sales range of private liquor was too narrow and the amount of sales was too small. It was a means of hiding his real business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, he really is a bit reluctant to make a profit. Not only more than before, but also saves trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when he stood at the door of the villa and saw Du Lin coming out of the car, he immediately opened his arms and walked down the steps and greeted him. "I Dear friends, welcome you!", he and Du Lin hugged a bit and immediately separated, leading Du Lin toward the villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villa of Ernst is built in the center of the city, slightly close to the edge. It is said that he has contact with the mayor and other big people in the city, especially The mayor, from time to time, will come here to sit down. Some people say that Ernst started out with his sister, who is one of the mayor's favorite mistresses. It is also said that Ernst’s ancestors were also nobles and had some connections with the mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the truth, in general, Ernst’s family and mayor have a relationship that cannot be separated, and it is precisely because of this relationship that he is qualified to be in the city. The center has built a villa with a separate garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two entered the villa, the decoration of the villa is very simple, and very angry, it seems that I have invited a very good designer. After the two entered the living room, the butler sent the tea and some fruit cakes and left. Ernst also smiled and asked why Du Lin suddenly visited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may not believe it when you say it!" Du Lin tried to make his tone full and true. "The goods we sent to Guri were robbed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernst snorted after listening, and then he laughed. "This joke is really interesting. I remembered it. I will use this joke next time I have a chance." Du Lin’s serious expression became weaker and weaker until it disappeared. Ernst frowned and asked, "Isn't it true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders. "Unfortunately, this is true. "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esterton took a sigh of relief, and the goods sent to Guri were worth 30,000 pieces, of which 14,000 were him and cards. Ruhr's, in which he occupied the majority, almost eight or nine thousand. Excluding the cost, the profit is around 4,000. This is because Du Lin has set the price and profit set by the private liquor market plan of other cities with low price and high quality. This move is very effective, and its own private liquor has a high profit. If the initiative to reduce profits will indeed have a huge impact on the mature market. From the previous trade volume and income, this move is very effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four thousand pieces of profit and 5,000 pieces of capital, close to 10,000 pieces of loss! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it has not been placed in Ernst’s heart, and it has not made him feel bad. He frowned tightly and asked in a deep voice: "How many people have died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin said this number, the expression was uncontrollable and became a bit weird. "The rest will not be yours?", when he got a positive reply, I laughed once. "I believe, really. No one will be stupid enough to black out for the risk of turning your face for this money. Do you have any ideas or countermeasures?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get your trust first, and then find out who is behind the ghosts!", this sentence Du Lin said murderous, reflecting his most real attitude at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a good sign, because once the news spreads, more people will put their ideas on Du Lin’s team. As long as you can get enough people and have enough weapons, you can say that the looting of the private transport team is almost a standard. Dooling can't find those people in a short time and then get rid of them. Then, if they expand outwards and transport private wine, they will become dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand pieces is enough for many people to risk the death to do something they can't bear the consequences, let alone 30,000 here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have any plans?", Ernst took an apple from the table and took a bite, full of juice as he chewed from Splash between the lips and teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and said: "I have a plan!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two talked For a while, I left the villa together and went to the villa on the outskirts of Karur. Persuading Karur obviously did not convince Ernst that it was so easy. The old man of Karur was stubborn. If it wasn’t for Doolin to come with Ernst, it would be very likely that the old man would turn his face with Du Lin. This is actually not related to the loss of thousands of pieces. For these three people, thousands of pieces are not too much money. What really affects is the question of trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today you can eat black and eat up a batch of goods, maybe tomorrow you are going to swallow my entire person. In the shadows outside the light, there is no goodness to speak of. If Karur has a strong strength, he can be an enemy. Maybe he has the intention to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Du Lin and Ernst are two people, no matter who is stronger than him, he can only believe Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what should I do next? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course find those people, and then blood to blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Big Three" is discussing how to make the enemy pay the price, the mayor met with Heidler, just in the mayor's office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the police, some people are always inexplicably passing by, with hesitant colors, seeing someone stand up and telling the secret, the park was stripped The leather car washes left the people outside the police station with a hesitant color disappearing without a trace. Some people say that the disappearance of these people is related to the car wash workers' experience. Some people are warning these people who are about to become leakers and manage their mouths. Whether this is true or not, the mayor is when he is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he met with Heidler and wanted to know if he was a man behind him, was Heidler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
