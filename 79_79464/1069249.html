			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You scared my wife!", Jackson looked at his wife's shoulder and looked at Du Lin sitting at the table, his eyes were a bit fierce. No one wants to be violently disturbed in such a time, and it is still his home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin heard a look at Jackson’s wife and saw that the hand held by Jackson was shaking slightly, and Du Lin owed a debt. I am very sorry, Ms., I am here in a less friendly way. I apologize for my actions!" He smiled at Jackson’s wife. "This is just a very common meeting. I will not be with Mr. Jackson. Any conflicts and conflicts broke out. By the way, can I add a pair of cutlery to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson was surprised that Du Lin actually was his wife. Apologizing for this, Du Lin recognized the bastard as soon as he sat down. It’s not a strange thing to know Du Lin. The strange thing is that Du Lin can’t recognize Du Lin. This guy often appears in newspapers. He is young, rich, and has a high status. This makes it impossible for people who see him and know him not to take him. Remember firmly. But he apologized, and this seems to be different from the rumor that Du Lin’s arrogance, he is said to be a very rude guy, and there has never been an apology in the dictionary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know where a rumor came from. It’s said that Du Lin was pointed at the head with a gun. He not only did not retreat but also let the man shoot. As a result, it is not necessary to continue to say that Du Lin’s ability to jump around in front of people is enough to explain everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson patted his wife’s back and said softly to her, “Add a tableware for Mr. Doolin. It seems that we have to stay here for dinner. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson who came back to the world quickly calmed down. He didn't believe that people like Du Lin would go to his home and do it to him. What kind of thing is more likely to hurt him, because Du Lin is not so stupid. The reason why he did this is to want to psychologically give himself a process of short-term fear, shocking himself. Mr. Jackson, who knew this, quickly got relieved. When he took his wife to pick up the tableware, he asked, "What do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I will come over and visit you, and then say something else. You know that when I came back today, I heard people say that there are some people who are carrying me sneaking..." Du Lin closed his mouth, Jackson’s wife. Coming back soon, she placed a plate with a Phnom Penh in front of Doolin and put a silver knife and fork on him. Du Lin said a thank you, and then continued, "I prefer the contest of going straight, like this trick that secretly sneaked on me behind me, I hate it, Mr. Jackson."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that it is necessary for me to have a deeper understanding of what the group of people sneak up and say, how to deal with my law-abiding imperial citizen." He said with a smile. "Well, what's the matter?" When I finished the meal, I felt so hungry when I saw such a hearty dinner. When I went out, I didn’t eat anything.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the lead in picking up the knife and fork Tearing a roast chicken on the table, Mr. Jackson looked at his wife with some helplessness, and they both picked up the knife and fork and started. Du Lin, who had a meal, was very satisfied. There was a saying that was very good. The dishes on other people's tables were very popular. Many people would feel this way. It seems that the dishes made by others are better than the ones in their own home. At least Du Lin felt that this table dish was very delicious, and there was a very warm taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After eating and drinking, Mr. Jackson invited Du Lin to the study room on the second floor and asked his wife to bring a pot of coffee. They might need to talk. Last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s simple cleansing and rubbing his hands, he sat in a chair—there was no sofa in Mr. Jackson’s study, only a few chairs and foot piers, Doolin Looking for a seat, it feels good. After a while, Jackson’s wife came in with a coffee pot and two coffee cups, and each of them got a cup. Du Lin stood up and took the coffee tray and asked it under the nose. Then he set aside the small round table. "It smells very fragrant, thank you very much for your hospitality, madam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a meal, Jackson’s wife had no fear of Du Lin, and her face showed a smile. She even thought that Du Lin was a very good boy. Young, looks good, very capable and very knowledgeable. After the little unpleasantness at the beginning, Du Lin’s funny conversation and wise performance at the table made Jackson’s wife see a rumor. A completely different dulin, there is also a little like this young guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the view of Mrs. Jackson, a child is alone in a place far away from home, surrounded by predators who do not spit bones, do not show tough Some of the dregs that have long been swallowed up are not left. She forgave Du Lin, then put away the tray and smiled and left. "Let's talk about it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the study, don't forget to close the door of his wife, Jackson. Shaking his head with a wry smile, the most successful speculation in his life was to marry his wife, and he was proud of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a sip of coffee and praised the taste of the coffee. Then the previous topic continued. "I want to know what you said in the morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Jackson first stared at Du Lin, and looked down at the coffee in his hand. "Why do you think I will say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin laughs Two times, gave Jackson an answer that I couldn’t think of, "Because I am a good person!", when Jackson shocked Du Lin's skin thickness is simply shocking, Du Lin added, "Don't laugh, because Among the group of people, you are the weakest party and the one who needs the most help. Mr. Jackson, I know most of the things you have done before, I know your person and know your family. So I know that you I need help, just that I can provide you with the help you need.", when it comes to Dullington, "Exactly, I need help, you are the one who can help me."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Jackson The former coffee seemed to be hiding an elf. He slowly stirred the coffee with a spoon. After a while, he looked up and looked at Doolin. "What do you want to know?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his legs, hands and fingers clasped on his legs, elegant and polite smile, "All!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Mr. Jackson is also faced with some complicated problems. If these problems are not handled well, they will become a problem. With the tobacco industry entering a profiteering period in the past two years, the Imperial Taxation Administration has submitted a new proposal to raise the starting point and rate of tax collection for another 19 products or industries in the tobacco industry. Social consultation and hearing procedures, there is news that the tax reform will be completed by the end of this year, and the tobacco industry's tax revenue will be directly increased from 15% to 55%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the SAT has made such a request is because the federal government relied heavily on dumping in order to avoid the return of tariff rights to the hands of the empire and the bilateral trade tariffs returned to normal. Commodities going to the Empire have experienced a wave of closures, so they began to limit some tariffs back to normal. This made the federal cigarettes in the empire less and less, and with the recovery and improvement of the imperial economy, a large number of rural people began to gather in the city, and the demand for cigarettes began to skyrocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, many tobacco companies went bankrupt because of federal cigarette dumping, and there were not many tobacco companies in the empire. This small group of tobacco companies are holding the entire empire’s tobacco market. They have gained too much profit. After the money is withdrawn from circulation, if these tobacco companies cannot continue to expand their business area, they will add more jobs and Re-investing this part of the money into the economic circulation system is definitely not good news for the empire's economic system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
