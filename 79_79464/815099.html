			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Jerez patted his cheek and woke up from his sleep, and he pushed the girl who squeezed himself on a bed from a narrow bed. Go on. With a bang, the girl woke up in a painful cry. She looked up a little and looked up. I don’t know if I fell down when I was rolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerez sat up and took five dollars from the clothes left by the bed and left it on the woman, which was an overnight fee. It is. The technology of Monter's girls is very good, but the competitiveness here is too great, and the price is just a little cheaper than some other places. This is still Jerez's choice. If he is not so taboo, two or three dollars can find a girl to spend the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that girls earn less, in fact they actually make money during the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bedroom is small, very ordinary, and Jerez is doing smuggling business. Naturally, it is impossible to use the money exchanged for life for the purchase of the industry. It is not a shrewd investment behavior, it is purely looking for death, and it is too much money. In case something goes wrong, all his industries will be frozen, and the money for investing in home ownership will be finished. He never did such an investment, and all the money was in the Imperial Commercial Bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial banks are the banks that the general chamber of commerce came out of, which is far worse than the central bank. Commercial banks are a little better, that is, they never Open the customer's personal information. When you sit down at the counter in the bank and say that you want to open an account, the counter salesperson will give an account and then set a password or submit a token to leave. The salesperson does not ask for any information during the entire process, which guarantees the safety of these funds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, commercial banks do not have as many rules as the Imperial Bank, regardless of whether the account has access in recent years or whether the owner of the account is finished. Anyway, as long as someone can provide a password or a token, they will act in accordance with the rules and regulations. Unlike the central bank, if the head of the household dies, if there is no heir, or if the heir does not know the account, if there is no access during a certain period of time, the account will be cancelled and the money in the account will be transferred to a special account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bosses who put their money in the imperial central bank have to go to jail in case of a mistake, they may wait ten or more years after they have served their sentences. Freely exchanged money has become the bank's money. If you want to get back the money, you can't say how difficult it is to fight the lawsuit. After providing all the evidence, the central bank will also take the money out, but the time, energy, financial resources and contacts consumed here are not worth it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the reason why commercial banks can stand out from the crowd, at least they have done the "think for the customer" article. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has spent a lot of money in the past few years, there are seven or eight hundred thousand, but he doesn’t think it’s enough. He plans to wash his hands after one million. Got a little pleasant place to marry and have a happy life. In order to accomplish this as much as possible, he really did not have the goods he dared to ship in the past few years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washed a face, went to the debris warehouse in the backyard, and watched the five Guarts hanging on the beam, he was sober . He took the slap to wake these people up, and then took a whip from a basin filled with sea water. The whip is made of long wooden strips with wide heads, and the edges and corners are tied together. When a whip is down, it will cause several blood marks on the body. Adding this whip to soak the sea water, the salt is sucked in, causing pain and pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it still unwilling to speak?", his glanced eyes swept over the faces of five people. "As long as you say where the shipment comes from." What is the name of the principal behind you, I will let you go, give you a sum of money, go where you want to go." He raised the whip in his hand and slammed it in the nearest On the body of the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more I can't judge the details of these people, Jerez is actually more panic. The days of bloody knives have gone too far. He naturally knows that these people do not say what they want, or because they have a very strict organization behind them, so that they dare not say that even if they face death, they dare not say it. Either this group of people are mad and are extremists. He has seen both of them. It is because he has seen it, so he is more flustered and wants to dig out what is behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time left for him is not much. Once the other party discovers the problem, it is very likely that it is the thunder. He knows that the most important thing he should do at this time is to leave Monterey with his brothers and find a place again. But he is not reconciled. He also hates what he wants to do at the time. He has to get these people into his own hands. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result got a big trouble back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many large organizations and extremist organizations are raising money through smuggling, and he is just a small fight compared to those big monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who was beaten by him snorted and rolled his eyes, saying nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that they don’t want to say it, nor that they really have any great faith to be dedicated, but they don’t dare to say it, and Du Lin has promised them, and will save them whenever possible. If they said that they should not say, Du Lin did not say the consequences, but everyone knows the end of betrayal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of slowly dying in painful suffering, it’s better to die a little bit better, at least not only not with family, but also with a generous pension. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of their hatred made Jerez’s heart tremble slightly. He pulled a long, half-footed knife from his ankle. “I’m patient. Exhausted, the next time you open the answer, either answer the answer or die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes look back and forth on the faces of five people, someone looks calmly With him, someone is glaring at him, but some people are avoiding his gaze! His eyes lit up and went to the front of the fourth person who was hanging and looked at him. The young man was only eighteen or nineteen years old, younger than everyone else. His eyes were a little dodging, and Jerez laughed. Death is indeed the best way to force people to change their will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He admits that some people can face the face of death, but not everyone is like this, his tip is already aligned with the one that can be used as his child. The young man’s chest was gently plunged in. A trace of blood slowly flowed from the wound along the edge of the sharp knife and dripped on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to say it?", the strength of Jerez’s hand has increased a bit, the tip of the knife has gone in about a centimeter, and the speed of blood flow is also more Soon. The muscles and expressions on the big boy's face were madly twisted and twitched. He bit his lip and tears swarmed out of his eyes. He shook his head hard, and Jerez chuckled and increased his strength. More blades pierced the muscles of the boy, and he became more and more scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He twitched and pleaded: "Please..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerez is not at all As he moved, the blade went deep again. He looked up at the big boy and met his gaze. "I can already feel the beating of the heart. Hey, maybe next time, or next time the next tip will pierce you. Heart, even if you want to say it is too late.", but when he finished this sentence, he took out the sharp knife and let the guards solve the boy from the beam. "Let's talk about it alone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dragged the boy's arm and dragged him out of the warehouse. The rest of the four faces were extremely ugly, but they seemed to see a moment of ease from their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want their companions not to say, but there is another idea in their hearts that they are not willing to admit. If he can say that it is the best, then they will No need to face other tortures, or even death. This is a very contradictory emotion, expectation, and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no sound coming from outside. After about ten minutes, Jerez’s eyes twitched and walked back. He wiped the blood that had been sprayed on his face, and his heart had been falling down, and he was about to fall into the abyss. He is not afraid of rushing with those smuggling gangs, nor is he afraid of confronting the traffickers who make private wine, but he is afraid of the rich. When the young man told him that his boss was a very rich and rich man, Jerez had already felt the fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knife in his hand still has blood beads. He looks at the four young people who are hung up, and the fierce eyes are shining with fierce light. . He took a deep breath and whispered a sigh, then walked behind the first person, licking his hair and cutting his neck with a sharp knife in his hand... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jerez returned to the house, all his men were packing up. Although I don’t understand why I suddenly left Monter, a place that has already been managed, but in the past few years they have been used to obey Jerez’s orders. Jerez is not only fierce, but also very embarrassing. Everything was very convincing to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned slightly. "There is no need to bring clothes, and buy them later. Weapons, books, contacts, and other valuable things are carried. Ster, let's drive the truck, we don't have much time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although everyone is convinced of Jerez, they also want to know why they left suddenly. Judging from Jerez's behavior, he did not intend to come back here again. This meant that they had abandoned the site and market that had been spent for more than two years. This is indeed very difficult to accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerez can only smile with these questions: "We have caused a big problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s face suddenly became unhealthy. The “big trouble” from Jerez’s mouth is definitely a big trouble. They speeded up and took their personal belongings out of the door. East's trucks haven't come yet, they need to wait for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
