			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andorra’s news of delisting from the west soon spread to the entire west. Andorra’s reputation in the west is not bad, and it’s usually low-key in social situations. His understanding is also limited to the knowledge of others. But in general, the mine owners who operate in the wilderness of the west, even if they have not spoken to Andorra, are also heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, Andorra is dead, and is said to have been hanged on the whistle tower outside the mine. This has caused many people to have an inexplicable enemy. anger. Doolin’s approach has somewhat undermined the rules of the Western world. No matter how much he wants to get the mine in Andorra, he always has to maintain his own eating. Not to mention hiring those horses to wash the mines in Andorra. It is not impossible for him to use his own hands, but can he not appear on his own, and he claims to be responsible for this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a rule that has been stipulated in the western world of red fruit, so that some people blush, but also feel that Du Lin should be so indistinct The people are going out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the west, not the east coast, not the south, and his set is not very useful here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second day of the death of Andorra, Mr. Jack gave a call to Du Lin, Andorra introduced him to Du Lin, but now Du Lin killed Andorra, and no matter whether his middleman is obligated to preside over justice, he must stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, ask what happened, not just to be fair, but also to maintain his own and the face of the organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't think that your temper is the same as before, is it the price is not close, or is he arrogant not looking at your eyes when he speaks?" Mr. Jack spoke about this with a joking tone. He didn't want to make a bigger contradiction with Du Lin. He called to maintain his image, even if Du Lin gave him a very absurd. For reasons, he can take it out to block some people's mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that I don’t talk to Andorra, but that Dulin does give a reason for “sufficient”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not surprised that Mr. Jack will contact himself. He can actually contact Mr. Jack, but he can’t take the initiative in his own hands. Mr. Jack may ask Andorra to compensate Duolin for a loss, or sell the mine to Doolin at a low price, which is not what Du Lin wants. He really realized this when he was chatting with Mr. Federley. He could use money to get most of what he wanted in the West, but he couldn't get people's fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear in emotion actually represents a very bad state. A person is feared by others not because of how great he is, but how awful he is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is the set that is used in the civilized world. People need to maintain their own image and make themselves look not only rich but also very kind, otherwise why Are people happy to hold and participate in charity evenings? Isn't it just to show that you use wealth to help the poor, to reflect your good social virtues, and then to use armed forces to arm yourself, so that others can easily hurt themselves? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the West, these things are useless. The good reputation of goodness will only attract disasters. Those horses are afraid to touch the big names who have bad names, but the big names with good names can still test the bottom line. So here, bad names are more useful than good names. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;瞧, it’s very useful, it’s only two days before your notoriety has been passed back to Otis, which is much more useful than spending money to get status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Mr. Jack’s question, Du Lin told him the truth, “The Mr. Andorra you introduced to me intends to swallow me with the belt meat, in order to avoid some The problem of continuous fermentation was finally lost, so I used the easiest way to solve this problem. By the way, I would like to ask, is this the 'integrity user' that you introduced to me?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin gave Mr. Jack a word in a word, he would not doubt Doolin, because Dooling did not need him to doubt. Comparing the identity, status, and wealth of Du Lin and Andorra, Andorra is not a powerful figure at all. Du Lin does not need to do such a thing to lower his grades, so it must be An Dao. There was a problem there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jack has heard of some rules of the Western world. At that time, he also thought that this might just be a good "advocacy" of some westerners in their hometown. Let people be afraid of the West, and people from the West. I didn't expect that everything was true. What he didn't think was that his client had a problem. It was absolutely unforgivable to want to murder Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Jack immediately made a save. "I am very sorry, Mr. Doolin, I will announce it personally. As a middleman, I am very derelict. This makes Both of us have had some negative effects. I will deal with the next problem in this matter, and I will definitely produce a result that will satisfy you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"No, I will handle this matter personally, and you don't need to worry that this will affect the cooperation and friendship between our two parties. It is just that I use this matter to open up the situation in the west. People here should learn something, at least They have to know what awe is!", Du Lin looked at a few people standing by the wall, and then said something to Mr. Jack, hanging up in Mr. Jack’s repeated apologies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Du Lin said that he would handle it himself, he believed that Mr. Jack would do something, at least to show his attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the few people on the wall, a gray-haired old woman, a well-preserved woman in her forties, looks only thirty How many years old, there are four young people. The largest is only 23 to 4 years old, and the youngest is only 14 to 5 years old. They dare to stand in the wall and do not dare to move. These people are the family of Andorra, and his family also lives in the west. There are indeed many places in the west that are not as good as the South and the East Coast. For those who have already lived here, this is the best choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin asked Dudu to bring these people back at night, and there are still some documents that they need to sign, such as the free transfer agreement of the mine, and Transfer agreements for other industries and property. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andorra was going to do what he was doing now, and now Du Lin gave him the original way, in his own way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are several documents here, who are the two ladies?", Federer’s lawyer immediately took the documents on the table and left. In the past, explain the content and nature of these documents. Du Lin's feet were on the head of Andorra's favorite white lion, but that Andorra did not touch the baby, but now it has become the foot of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two women of the two grades are the wives of Andorra. Like many elderly people, Andorra is also the senior of that. The priest, he firmly believes that the gods enshrined in the gods can bless him and his family to live peacefully on this land. Tusiism itself is a male-respected religious institution, arguing that a husband can marry multiple women as wives, and many people have joined the Tushenism because of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth mentioning that many mine owners and rich people in the west are people of Tushenism. The potential of the Tushenism here is very large, like This younger woman is a believer cultivated by the Tushen. In this way, they use a loyal follower to be placed in the position of a person in the west, perhaps for money, perhaps for power. In short, the gods seem to have only those old witches who love to eat horses. Relationship is actually a hidden organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
