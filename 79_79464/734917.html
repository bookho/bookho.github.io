			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to the farm’s cellar, Buddha has already found an old locksmith, a Guar, now with Du Lin and fellow villagers. Seeing that only the Guars are trustworthy, the trials of the gods and the first kings are like a sword hanging on the heads of the Guars. No one dares to bear the fate of being judged to betray their compatriots, at least not enough to guarantee them. In the case of life safety, they are absolutely impossible to sell any compatriots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old locksmith has studied the night with two keyholes and a key around the iron box. He is covered with scars and the old man is holding another hand. Put the key, a key that is different. There was a hint of excitement on his face, just like showing off the two keys together. "Respected Mr. Doolin, you see, this is my research.", old lock The craftsman used the fashionable words of "research results" to illustrate his inner excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his knowledge of the locks, how can he not see the extraordinary things about this box? This is also his advantage. He did not ask where the box came from, nor did he consider whether it was legal to open the box. He was smart enough to circumvent things that he should not know to ensure his safety. Every surviving old man is a thick book of experience, and their rich life experience is indeed worth learning for young people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin carefully observed the two keys on his palm, one for Schubert, one for the old locksmith himself. But the old locksmith made the key and the key that Schubert gave was completely different. There is no tooth on the key of the old locksmith, just like a small metal piece stuck in front of a metal stick. In Du Lin's doubtful eyes, the old locksmith gently inserted the key he had made into the keyhole, then forced it slowly but slowly, and after several times, he pulled the key out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin discovered that the front of the key was not a complete piece of iron, but rather a dozen or so narrow iron bars. Large iron pieces formed. At this point, some of the iron pieces have been bent, and some of them are only partially curved. The old locksmith used a knives to draw a mark on those curved places, and then the excess parts that were cut off were covered after the knocking was neat. I didn't know anything about a thin layer. After heating, these narrow small iron bars became one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a very hard wax, we are often used to make prototypes for key release.", the old blacksmith explained, insert the key again After repeating it several times in the keyhole, he placed the last adjusted key together with the key Schubert took out and placed it in front of Dooling, "Respected Mr. Doolin, Do you see any difference between the two keys now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin carefully identified the two keys, and even took them together and carefully distinguished them. From the point of view of the tooth marks, the tooth marks of the two keys were almost exactly the same. Du Lin stunned the key to the old blacksmith and patted him on the shoulder. "Thank you for your help, which saves us a lot of things and solves our lack of time...", talking about him After a moment of indulging, "I will give you enough rewards for you and your family to use for a long time, and I hope that you can close this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The old locksmith took a deep bow and didn't have any verbal thanks, but Du Lin and everyone believed that he would not betray the people here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s time is running out. This is not his claim to himself or a joke. In fact, it’s calculated according to time, and this evening’s Tern’s The escort should arrive at Orodo, but now the escort has been robbed and it is naturally impossible to arrive on time. At the latest tomorrow, the Orodo side will send people to greet the search. In less than five days, the Imperial Central Bank of the city of Tener should receive news of the disappearance of the escort car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the guard force of the bank will inevitably be enhanced, and the emergency squad of the Imperial Central Bank will start to operate. They will search for any clues to find the car. The missing escort car. Any process of committing crimes cannot be completely cleaned up. As long as there is a little bit of evidence sufficient for judgment, it will be more difficult to get started with the vault. Therefore, Du Lin needs to complete the robbery plan for the vault in five days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very crucial five days, every minute and every second needs to be carefully arranged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being, let the old locksmith deal with the damn box, and Du Lin called everyone else together and found the information he had visited on the spot yesterday. They all told everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is absolutely no chance of winning the storm!", Du Lin directly vetoed the original plan A, he laid a floor plan of the bank hall with his own impression On the table, and marked some things to be aware of, "According to my observation yesterday, there are a total of twelve cabinet receptions in the bank. These receptions have a direct access to the underground vault sorting station. I deposited the cash directly into the underground vault." Then he took a pen and put a fork on a square. "This is the only passage to the underground vault. It is guarded by a total of four gun guards. Their vigilance is very high. At least, they are much higher than them." Du Lin looked at Schubert and his eyes were focused on him, making him a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Entering this elevator requires a key to open the iron door outside the elevator. This key is in the hands of the duty manager, and the keys will not be taken home, nor will they be placed on the body. They will hang behind the manager's room after they run out. On a hook, all the people in the bank can see the key through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the glass, which eliminates the possibility of stealing. It can be said that the measures of the Central Bank are perfectly arranged, maybe they used to Other places have been robbed, and all of them are particularly dedicated in this regard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin guessed it right, the Imperial Central Bank as the biggest economy of the Yaoxing Empire Body, being robbed is not a matter of twice. They are willing to use a building worth millions of buildings and harsh rules to guard against a deposit of only one million, and will not let their own territory be abused by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the pen on the table, the atmosphere is a bit dignified, I thought it might not have a great central bank, I didn’t think there was such a perfect building system and system. System, which makes everyone feel heavy about the next action, this is not a simple task! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked around in a circle and suddenly smiled. "What happened? I just said that the storm is difficult, but I have not said that we have no way. "Isn't it?", everyone's eyes were concentrated on Doolin's body for a moment, and the old locksmith on the side was like a blind man, trying to open the damn box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although there is no way to attack, but I already have another solution, as long as I don’t have any problems, I can definitely complete our unconsciously. This robbery plan... No, not robbery, but collection. Of course, this requires Schubert's help, in order to make you worry-free, all Buddha...", Du Lin shouted, and the Buddha immediately straightened. On the back, Du Linnu said, "You go to take Schubert's family to a safe place, and then send them to other cities after the event is over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Dudu nodded and turned away. Schubert had some whitish faces, but in this environment, he had no reason and guts to oppose it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jos, from today on, you are the third team leader, bringing people to find a few reliable tailors, and the work on hand must be good." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Savi, take your team member and stare at Prando. Before we finish, let him tell me if there is any change. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
