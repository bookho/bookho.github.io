			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This auction is only a participant who is not the host. Of course, Stan Ein thinks he can handle the inquiries of these people, but Doolin still let him I chose a more professional auctioneer, charging by the hour and having a commission. Of course, under the care of acquaintances, there is definitely no commission, but the cost can not be discounted. The cost of one thousand blocks per hour is indeed a high standard in the industry, but the host is really good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 148 delegates sitting on the floor starting from the first place in the auction began the killing of the red fruit, and there was no temptation at all. Class, the first person's opening is 10 million, directly let some ready to call out, even the person holding the brand raised the hand has received the hand back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, every time the first bidder of the same kind of auction is always able to take advantage of it, as long as you call out an amazing price, other participants will have a wonderful idea. They will feel that these powerful people will be sent out first, and then the price will fall. But the fact is often the opposite. In the auction of similar products of the same kind, the first ones are often lower than the average transaction price, but people can't remember the lesson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next three calls, the price stayed at around 10 million, and then the price started to rise sharply, as most bidders found that although it seems to have four A strong person has already got something to leave, but the rest is less, and the competitive environment is even worse. Everyone wants to settle this matter as soon as possible, and the price continues to stir up to a maximum of 22 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last raft fell, the little yellow hair that hosted the auction was excited and even the voice began to shake. More than 200 million auctions were only seen in his life. More importantly, he presided over the auction and will be one of his most important capitals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the break, he even assured Du Lin that in the future, as long as Du Lin’s auction, he would definitely help the host free of charge, not a penny, including The commission for this one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auctioneer is actually similar to lawyers and more special industry practitioners, and is very concerned about a qualification. If an auctioneer-sponsored auction auctioned more than 30% of the auction and had a certain number of auctions, he basically said goodbye to the auctioneer industry. But if you can host an auction with a total amount of more than 200 million, it will be a huge opportunity for him. In the future, his commission will increase by more than one grade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the auction, fifteen photographers were invited by Du Lin to enter the seventh floor conference hall of the Empire State Building. The next step was delivery and other issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like the amount of 200 million is huge, in fact, the cash delivery part is 50-60 million, and the remaining 100 million will pass other ways. To deliver, including mortgages and loans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifteen shooters are basically real capitalists. They are more aware of how to play with capital games. These people are also the people Du Lin needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they entered the conference room and saw Du Lin, they were a little surprised, and some of them used Du Lin as a waiter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Du Lin’s self-introduction, these people were temporarily honest, and then Du Lin needed to tell them about the new gameplay – they used thousands In order to get tickets for this game, it is natural to carefully listen to Du Lin’s gameplay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The distillation method we use can easily solve the high cost of materials such as Dragon Blood, and the wine made from raw materials without dragon blood. Pure distilled spirits can be obtained by distillation. I will arrange for people to demonstrate for you and guide them. After that, you can make your own wine and sell it to the market." Du Lin faces these The capitalists talked timidly, they listened very carefully, and spent so much money is not for this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone raised a small question, "Mr. Doolin, as far as I know the owner of the patent is Mr. Clark, then you and Mr. Clark..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled. "Clark is a good friend of mine. I will make all the decisions in the future by Mr. Clark. I have any questions. I can come to me.", he said, he nodded and gestured to the guy to close his mouth. He went on to say, "I believe that everyone has spent a lot of money to get authorization to get a higher return, but the chaotic market. It will expose us to the risk of different sizes. I think we have the obligation and the obligation to unite into a group and order the chaotic order!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The winners have expressed their approval. This is what they hope. The purpose of using low-alcohol distillation to purify the spirits is to release sufficient profit margins to fight an unequal war with other producers. After eliminating those miscellaneous brewers, at least 80% of the entire empire's brewing industry will be fully controlled by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no exaggeration to say that 80% of the annual consumption of more than one billion drinks will become the food in the dishes of these people. The forces represented by each person can at least get more than 670 million shares, except for various channels. And sales, their profitability will exceed 20 million a year. So they did not hesitate to shout out the daunting price to seize this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have an idea..." After a brief communication, people have already thought that Du Lin deserves to be valued. What he said is more worthy of attention. Thoughts. Du Lin raised his hand and pointed out a finger casually. "In a year, through reasonable and legitimate competition and other means, as much as possible to squeeze the brewing workshops and manufacturers that do not belong to our circle, I I hope that at this time next year...", his finger clicked on the table, and the crisp voice was like being on the heart of these people, letting them involuntarily straighten up, "the empire is all over the country, winemaking The scale of the workshop is now 20% or even less!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of those capitalists suddenly showed red or green luster, competitors The less, the more shares you represent, and the empire's economic recovery, people have more money in their pockets and need more enjoyment. This is a world with unlimited possibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it has been suggested that if someone steals this very simple way of purifying to produce spirits, the person who raises the question is suddenly looked at by fifteen eyes. He smiled awkwardly and closed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it is to protect their legitimate rights and interests, let them disappear through legal and illegal means, this is a market of more than one billion a year, dare to stretch their claws? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the claws will be smashed, but even the masters of the claws will be destroyed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After negotiating all this, Du Lin has received more than 80 million transfers, and more than 110 million will be in the next five years. It is paid out year after year, and will generate a point of interest that is one point higher than the bank loan interest rate, which is 7.98 percent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these money, Doolin returned to the city of Otis, and he needed the money not to build the city of Otis, but to have a huge The plan, which requires a lot of money, may even say that the funds are not enough to support his plan, so he needs more money to flow into his pocket. This plan will definitely not be alone, and there will be more people involved. He calls this plan a "pineapple pie". Why is it not because of the "apple pie"? He doesn't like apples. He likes to eat. pineapple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will invite those who can become helpers in the future to join the plan, such as the top of the new party, such as Magus, and those big capitalists, such as John, Colliers and the like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The return of this plan is about a thousand times or more, so he doesn’t care how many people join the plan, but he is afraid that too few people will join. , has an adverse effect on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, all he needs to do is silently prepare, and then shock the world again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day of his return to Otis, he attended a opening ceremony, and the warehouse area built by Mr. Jack was completed. Mr. Jack and the "poker" are very smart. They don't run the business that may be risky, or their ideas are stable. The construction of the warehouse area is always a blessing. The maintenance of the warehouse area only requires some maintenance costs and monthly labor on a quarterly basis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plus Doolin guarantees that the city of Otis will not exceed two warehouse areas, which is enough to guarantee Mr. Jack and his organization behind the next 30 years in Otis Income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was pleased to go to the appointment, participated in the ribbon-cutting ceremony that was circulated from the Federation, and also said a few words, giving Mr. Jack a lot of face. After the break, Du Lin pulled Mr. Jack into the corner and found a place where no one had talked privately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two went to the temporary stacking area behind the warehouse area, the empty place could not hide people, the wind can also completely silence their words, Du Lin looked Looking around, I said, "I want to talk directly to the Queen or the King. Do you have any idea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jack frowned, his facial expression Still very stiff and uncoordinated, it was very uncomfortable to watch, just like what was covered on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am taking the liberty, is there any important thing? If you can, it is best for me to transfer to two adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took out the cigarette case, took out a cigarette, and the cigarette butt licked against the cigarette case. In the last two weeks, he found that the tobacco in the cigarettes is not as tight as it used to be, and may be related to Rani’s proposal to increase tobacco taxes. Almost all cities throughout the empire have begun economic construction, attracting a large number of people from the countryside to enter the city. There is no place in the city for them to grow their own tobacco leaves, and with the increase in wages, cigarette sales have begun to rise significantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
