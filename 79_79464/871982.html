			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart beat when Chester was on the train gave him a feeling of being uncomfortable, even if he was sitting in the first class of the neat train that had just appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long period of investigation, inquiry, grooming and design for about a year and a half, the Imperial Railways Department finally launched the first class service across the board. The reason why First Class appears so slowly is because the two titles of First Class and Second Class have triggered protests from some social thought activists who believe that launching this service on a steam locomotive is a restoration of class concept. In order to artificially increase the behavior of the social class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This view has to be said to be very wonderful. What is even more amazing is that this view has an unbelievable audience, especially the provincial sage group has called for it to have been eliminated. Today, after the concept of class hierarchy, this dangerous thought cannot be restored and the contradictions between different fields in society can be increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the issue of first class has been discussed and repeated, and there have been no more than ten hearings. The ultimate court of the empire considered the purpose of setting up first class. It is set up for the passengers to enjoy better treatment on the road. It has nothing to do with the social class level. Anyone can spend the first class without spending money, no matter what race or occupation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is to say, the tramp and the donkey must not be able to buy the first class ticket even if they have money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Chester’s heart was hard to settle down, and the death of Andy’s brother cast a shadow on him, just like before Claus died. Knowing who is doing it to himself, Chester does not know who is working for the Anton brothers, what is the purpose, what is the motivation, he knows nothing. He even once suspected that the death of Andy brothers might be related to the death of Abel. After all, the brothers only did this in the recent period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Chester frightened. If it is for this reason, then those hands-on people will not be able to do it to him. After all, he Played a very disgraceful role, not only to seize Abel's industry, but also to send him back to God, whether the killers will choose themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after he handled all the things in anxiety, he packed up and sold Abel’s dozens and twenty years of accumulation and went to Otis. train. He believes that within Dolin's control, if anyone wants to kill himself, he must first consider Doolin's opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first class service has just been launched, with only 12 separate cabins in one compartment, ensuring the privacy and privacy of each passenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knock on the door awoke Chester. After he whispered a question, the sweet voice of the crew came from outside the door. He opened a slit and saw A young girl stood in the aisle with a variety of drinks in the cart. The second ban on alcohol issued by the empire seems to be meaningless to the crew system, just as it is not known at all. In addition to the high spirits, there is a little lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., what kind of drink do you need?", a ticket worth six dollars provides a light meal and two free drinks. Drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chester felt nervous, and he glanced at the drink on the cart, a bit stunned. "Give me a drink that will relax me. Thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flight attendant quickly picked up a bottle and poured a glass of wine for him, and placed it on the saucer at his hand. "Please slow down." If you have any need, you can press the green button on your left hand side and wish you a pleasant trip."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chester once again thanked and closed the hatch, he picked up The wine took a sip, and the spicy liquid made him want to spit out when he rolled in his mouth, but he swallowed, the flame rushed into the stomach along the throat, and stimulated in the stomach. After that, the heat flow was completely opened and he was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took only three hours from Nano Lindes to Otis, and he slept for a while, waking up in the train The radio is telling all passengers that the city of Otis is here. He held his forehead and rubbed his head. The eyebrows were already screwed together. I don't know if it was an illusion. He felt a little pain in his stomach. He checked the suitcase and picked it up and got off the bus under the guidance of the flight attendants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood on the platform and quickly left after recognizing the direction. The girl who poured the wine for him had been staring at him in the window until I couldn’t see him before I recovered my gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fast pace keeps the whole body moving, and Chester licks his stomach from time to time. He always feels that the stomach is getting more and more uncomfortable. He guesses that Not because there is no meal. These days have been in the process of mental tension, often busy to forget to eat, until the feeling of hungry is strong attack. He lifted his wrist and looked at the time. There was still a time away from the time he and Du Lin had agreed. He found a small restaurant on the side of the road and asked for a local speciality. The ground beef was steamed with wheat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came here two times ago, he felt that the city of Otis was really a country. Only the countryman would use the steaming method to deal with the wheat kernel, and he also felt that it was not so delicious. After returning to Nano Lindes, he was most impressed by the city of Otis, except for the young mayor, who was steamed with wheat. The beef and broth are completely covered with steamed wheat kernels. There is also a goose egg yolk on the top layer. After stirring, the mellow taste combines with the unique taste of beef, which is unforgettable for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While eating and thinking about some of the things to talk about when meeting Du Lin, he decided to give up more benefits to win in advance. The Andy brothers are dead, and Abel is dead. He knows that he can't afford a city's public transportation rights, so there must be trade-offs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Abel had a very broad connection, so he could. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andy brothers can do it because they are hot enough that others won’t be tempted to provoke these two guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he can't do it alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t tried it. He has been doing things for Abel before, when the big guys will meet him and listen to him. But when Abel died, he discovered that he thought he was his own network, and no one wanted to see him. At this time, he realized that he was not a big man at all. He was just a small person who couldn’t be small. He didn’t even have the qualifications of those people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now his only idea is to abandon more income, hold Duolin’s thigh tightly, and then find a remote place to live a few years later. Abundance of life until the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly a stream of heat in his nose, he quickly raised his face and reached out to touch the liquid flowing out of his nostrils, scarlet blood made him a little surprised . He pushed the plate and dropped a piece of money. He pulled out his handkerchief and stuffed his nostrils. He also needed to cover the excess handcuffs with one hand and left the restaurant a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about ten minutes, I waited for a while in the town hall door before I stepped onto the floor. He took the handcuffs outside the door of Doolin's office, and the nosebleed stopped, but he felt the blood clotting in his nose, which made him feel uncomfortable. At the same time, the abdominal pain was more intense, and he began to wonder if he had eaten or drank something unclean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his memory, when he was playing outside with his friends, because he was too thirsty, drinking a little river water caused his stomach to hurt for two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath, wiped out the dry blood stains outside the nostrils, took a deep breath and took a shot, patted his cheek and arranged it. The tie knocked on the door of the Doolin office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment he opened the door, his face appeared. Like a sincere smile, he first greeted Du Lin and then sat in the chair opposite Du Lin, "Mr. Mayor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words Before he finished, he was interrupted by Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that your boss is dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chester stunned, The brains boiled instantly, and countless excuses flashed in front of him. He finally decided to tell the truth. "This is indeed the case. This is a very painful news. At that time, I happened to be doing things for Mr. Abel outside." The pity and grief are as real as the actors trained in the opera, and even the eyes are red. "Now I took over the company of Mr. Abel, so I thought of asking you to see the city public we discussed last time. The traffic problem may need to be revised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin put down the pen, he leaned back on the chair, clasped his hands and fingers on his legs," How to change?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I intend...", he suddenly looked up and took out his handkerchief to hold his nostrils, and he took a breath at that moment. A thing with a solid touch slides down his nose into the eyes of his throat, and the heat flows again. Emerge, "I am very sorry, I am rude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The death of Mr. Abel has dealt a serious blow to me, and my body has recently been uncomfortable... "He continued to talk about the business: "On the basis of the original, I decided not to subsidize the city hall, I don't want a penny, and I also hope that the city hall can buy shares. I flipped through the information of several famous developed cities in the empire." The public transportation systems of these cities are in the hands of the city hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think this is very beneficial for the next operation, on the one hand, the city hall We can supervise our work, and there are no artificial obstacles in coordination, which is conducive to the healthy development of public transport companies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
