			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a meeting after three years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin got off the bus and saw Albert standing at the door of the villa to greet him. When he stepped on the ground with both feet, Albert quickly I greeted it, oh, hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are "owners" around the villa. The people arranged by Doolin, he always guesses everyone with the most malicious, and then let others use loyalty. Torn the label that Du Lin gave them. Before he was fully trusted by Doolin, those who were not born and died for him were suspected. So he arranged a whole set of Albert's team to "protect" his safety. He also warned him that he knew that Dulin could become a nightmare for many people, not because he was stupid because he was in his hands. The knife is sharp enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the unrelated people in the villa were cleaned up today, and Du Lin held a lazy waist to let Albert get up. He calmly looked straight into Albert's eyes, the latter's eyes had a trace of suspicion, and then gradually stabilized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, go in and say." He took the lead and walked inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villa is very luxuriously equipped, not only has a huge swimming pool, but also two small fountains and a tennis court, and some on the left side for outdoor use. The activity paved with a green rubber floor. Said to be a villa, in fact, a huge garden and area than the manor, the level of luxury is not weaker than some small estates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the villa, Doolin arranged for Natiya to rest, and he went to the study with Dufo and Albert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the door closed, Doolin went to the chair where the master of the study sat down, and Albert sat on the chair outside the table. He flipped through the two documents placed on the table, which were placed here to let him see and then let him look. He is not his former, and Albert is not the former Albert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the chairman of a large group of companies, his improvement over the past few years has surpassed people's imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People, everyone, are individuals with endless potential, and no one knows how much potential they have. When Albert came here to preside over the work, he would never do anything. He was a salesman who ran the business. Of course, he also worked for Doolin for a while and opened a service company for the rich. That kind of small company is a lot different from a group company whose market value has exceeded 1.5 billion federal shields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Dooling did not look at the wrong person. He did not live up to this opportunity and finally made the entire group operate very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading the two documents, Doolin leaned back, and the chair of this chair leaned back after being stressed, making people sit more Comfortable. He clasped his hands and fingers and pressed them against his waist. He looked at Albert and asked, "You already know my plan, are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alber The headline is that Du Lin called him through a secret line and told him about the plan. This time, Doolin and a group of capitalists from the empire are preparing to harvest the economic achievements of the Federation for 20 years. If necessary, the federal economic and financial level should be reversed for at least ten years. At first, Albert felt a bit of a fantasy when he heard the plan. He was already the chairman of the group company. He was the master of 10,000 people except the anonymous majority shareholders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more things you touch in this society, the more he feels a person, or a few people, even if several consortiums want to block a country’s economy. Finance is almost impossible! Even if these people have more money, their funds can't be compared to a country. Maybe the operation is good, so that a country's economy and finance will fall into a small turmoil in a short time, but harvesting economic results..., a little knight novel It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Doolin...", Albert organized the language. "Please forgive me for taking the liberty. There is a problem that is bothering me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded, he continued. "When you sent me, I told me what to do, I think I was during this time. Although there are some immature performances in the work, I am finally able to pass your entrustment. I passed the exam." Du Lin nodded again. What Albert did is not just a simple pass. Of course, this has a certain relationship with Doolin's plan for how to do it. But if he is not this material, he will not teach him. He is not just passing. Should be a B. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not A, that’s because he’s not perfect on some things, not the best of Dulin’s ideals, so much that Doolin’s To help him build momentum on the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now the group company is growing faster and faster, and the stock price is getting higher and higher. According to the incomplete statistics of our financial appraisers, once the bilateral currency relationship is lifted, The federation will usher in a new development, and the stocks of our major subsidiaries will also rise rapidly, with joint construction being the most. Our economic appraisers believe that in a month or so, the group's market value will break through to 2 billion to 2 billion federal shields..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his hand at this time and prevented him from continuing. "You want to ask me, since we are so rich, why do we have to do something very dangerous and risky?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbor has a special look, he is what it means. Although he does not want to disobey Doolin, but such a huge group of companies, or a consortium that has been promoted to a new life, why ruin a consortium as a cost to try something that is absolutely impossible to succeed? This is obviously very uneconomical and he cannot understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do people live in this world for the rest of their lives? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is power, the second is wealth, now wealth is for him, and Du Lin is at your fingertips, no, they are already super rich, Arber The special-election member succeeded and entered the federal parliament. Now he is already a public figure, not only has money, but also the right, even the local mayor sees him to be polite. With such a foundation, why should he still toss, he does not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ideal is priceless, Albert." Du Lin’s face showed a hint of embarrassment. "Nothing is more valuable than ideal, especially The value of this ideal goes far beyond people's perception of wealth and power. I know that you have a lot of places that you don't understand, it doesn't matter, we still have time for you to gradually understand, this world, this country, It's more fragile than you think. It also makes you understand that the wealth you see, in my eyes, is just a pile of waste paper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He stood up with a handrail. "Okay, I am tired, do your thing during this time, don't let me down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alber Specially followed up and stood up. "I have already arranged the room..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!", Du Lin smiled and smiled. Head, "I have a place to live in the Federation, and I am not very convenient to appear here often. Keep the phone open during this time, don't happen any Don't want to see things, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert stunned and then bowed his head. "Yes, I know, Mr. Doolin." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin made people call Nadia, who was preparing to take a break, and left in the car. Even the driver stayed and switched to his own. Originally, Doolin was planning to rest here, but a brief conversation with Albert made him discover that this guy seems to have his own ideas. This is not a good sign. This is not an empire. There is no servant who is willing to die for him. His safety must be first. In addition to the people he brought on the face, Savi also sneaked a team with more than 100 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin didn't dare to bring too many people to come. He was a bit "notorious". If there were too many people, he might be closely monitored. Smuggling is actually not safe. Most of the snakeheads have collusion with the official forces. Like the snakeheads on the east coast of the empire, every time they bring people into or out of the country, they will pre-greet the Navy and Du Lin and tell them. I brought someone from where I came from, or where I plan to bring some people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground world has an order of the underground world. Many people in the underground world think it is a shame to collude with the official, but look at the big gangs and Some of the forces are purely playing their own? Is the singer of the multi-city underground power of the singer of the singer of the singer of the singer, and the people of the city hall? Which gang can expand as big as their permission? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert’s vague attitude made Du Lin suspicious. This is not good news, but it is also good news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt a trace of egg pain, why these people never understood, what they have is what Du Lin gave them, but they want Do things that violate Dorian’s will, do they not know that they have to pay for anything? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the window sill on the second floor of the villa, looking at the two cars leaving, Albert regained his gaze. He went to the sofa and sat down with his hands inserted. The line was pushed backwards and the whole person looked a bit decadent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has become accustomed to the life of the Federation, he is not used to fear, he has become accustomed to being respected by people who call him "Mr. Albert" or " "Mr. Member", he is accustomed to the extravagant high society life, used to push and exchange in the spotlight, and used to feel the sense of accomplishment of a business empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it’s possible to go with the wind anytime, anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should he do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also very confused. The things he has in his hands, the shares he owns are not his own. Those anonymous shareholders are really powerful people. At the time, Albert suspected that these people were also the pieces arranged by Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the road in the future? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
