			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to arrange Xiun, Du Lin did not have any mature ideas, in his opinion, just find a job for Xien Gan, but definitely not Let Xiuen enter his core circle. Give him a meal, it is to see how much friendship between the two people in the past, when Xiu En wants to use Dooling to pull down the high-rise of Tnel, and Du Lin also used the Zun The tiger skin of the Prohibition Bureau of Investigation almost annexed the private liquor market in half of the city of Tener City. By the way, some private wines detained in the warehouse were sold out and sold for a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For anyone in the early days of their career, even a penny is useful, not to mention the income from this unprofitable sale. Far above a penny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that Xiu’en is down, he takes the initiative to open his mouth and Du Lin doesn’t mind pulling him, but it’s not necessarily good to say how good he is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indulge in a moment, Du Lin said, "So, I can help you find something to do locally, if you are willing to do something yourself, I also I can support you.", Honestly, the appearance of Xiun at this time can not bring more benefits to Du Lin. First of all, he lost his previous work. This is the biggest disadvantage. He did not have the talent to make Du. Lin is tempted. Moreover, the fellowships have begun to wash their whites. After nearly a year of whitewashing, the fellowships have been completely divided with crimes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, there has never been any violent violation of a relationship with a fellow countryman. This is an ordinary fellowship used to build feelings and The unofficial social organization of personal connections has no harm to society. Du Lin’s distributors have also stopped criminal activities. They are not directly involved in any business. They just send a certain item to a place to let others sell it, and for some sensitive goods such as drinks. They also handled the contraband transportation permit and thoroughly washed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a step in Doolin’s big plan. He does not have a deep foundation in this society, although some people will call him "Du Lin." The head of the group and the like. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; washed in Turin interest groups will not make any obvious things against the law, so take advantage of the value of the repair grace becomes infinitely lower, stay It may not be useful, it is better to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiu Yan obviously did not consider that Du Lin would make such a decision. He would like to ask to stay with Du Lin, but he opened his mouth and did not say it. He chose to obey Du Lin's arrangement. Even if it seems that Doolin is not much different from the past, Xiu En still understands that this is a werewolf. In the criminal group headed by Du Lin, there may be hundreds of murders suspected. He is worthless now. In the event of Dorian’s vigilance, maybe one day will become the headline news in the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending away Xiun, an unexpected person called him, Sophia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sound, Sofia’s tone has some... It’s not like it’s strange, it’s like being weak, which makes Doolin worry about her. Sophia is a very important role in the agent system. It can be said that in the early days of the establishment of the agent system, this woman gave the whole system too much courage and confidence. The black widow’s name, the East Coast, is almost universally known and lays the foundation for Doolin’s smuggling empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds like a bad situation. Can you tell me what happened?" Du Lin asked Duff to pour a glass of wine for himself. With the shoulders and cheeks gripping the receiver, I walked into the yard, carrying a phone and holding a glass of wine in one hand. I found a chair to sit down, ordered a cigarette, and he had some unpredictable feelings. These hunches were quickly fulfilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia smiled twice, and soon the laughter was interrupted by a severe cough. She breathed with a whistle and heard that she was very sick. The only thing that is gratifying is that her mental state is not bad at this time. "I am sick. It may be that there are too many outings in the winter. You know, the winter on the East Coast is not comfortable at all. It has not been good until now. The doctor told me that I had pneumonia. Of course, you don't need to worry about me. I have used special medicine. The doctor said that I recovered well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East East The coast is not really a good place. Even if the damp and cold air is wearing thick clothes, you can feel the cold chills rushing into the body along the gaps in the clothes. Most people on the East Coast choose to go to the South in the winter, or stay in the room as little as possible. In the past two years, the development of the East Coast has been good. Even if there are many businesses in the winter, people with such faces as Sofia will inevitably be invited to participate in various banquet receptions and even as middlemen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The age of the person is large, and some things that are not valued on weekdays will gradually become a problem. She catches a cold and then starts to have a fever, and With a short period of horror. The hospital's diagnosis is severe pneumonia, and intervention has begun, but the effect is not obvious. In the past few days, her condition seems to be aggravating. The hospital recommended that she use the latest developed special effects drugs, but this drug has not obtained more verification data, and it has certain side effects and dangers. Sophia has a hunch that it may not last long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of hunch is very magical. Many people will feel this way when they are dying. They want to struggle but they are unable to struggle. They can only watch their lives go by bit by heart. She also has this kind of Feeling, so she called Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say this, I believe the hospital will save my life as much as possible in order to clean my pocket. They always do, will not give up Any rich man will not pity any poor man." The old woman was still in a mood to make a joke at this time, but Du Lin could hear the sadness hidden in the words, and his mood became worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People trust him and admire him, even if the old woman may not have much time, give him a call, he needs to do something," Tell me, Sofia, anything, as long as I can do it, this is my promise to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia has been keeping a smile, laughter is old and Some lonely. Before she met Du Lin, she lived very hard. Many of the Guarts were not very good. The heavy pressure of life made them need to do more hard work or even destructive work to support their families. Some things hurt the foundation, it is very difficult to make up, no one knows when something happens, everything will break out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I may not be able to go to this year's annual meeting. I am very sorry. If I allow my body, I will try to rush. Although I may not be able to go, But my daughter will take me to attend the annual meeting, this is the only thing I hope you can promise." Sophia coughed a few times, the whistle was heavier when coughing, and there seemed to be a medical staff’s stop, but it was She refused. "I understand her. She has many young people's ideas and her own pursuits. If she does something wrong, I hope that you can accommodate her once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't dare to ask for more, would you promise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia is worried that if the hospital does not go through, the hospital will open her The special medicine doesn't work, and everything she has now will soon vanish. Even if Du Lin takes care of her children, she can't stop people's glimpse of the wealth she left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way is to let her daughter continue to serve Du Lin, the only way to be able to keep what it has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not hesitate and directly agreed. "I will, if this is what you want, then I will do that."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
