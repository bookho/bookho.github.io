			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A separate interrogation room is located in the office building of the Regional Police Station. Du Lin’s interrogation alerted many police officers. As long as they had no jobs in their hands, they were almost crowded outside the door of the interrogation room, listening to the interrogation process inside. Everyone is very curious about the trial of Du Lin, a "big man" with a different status and status. Such big people are rarely able to be "live" to be interrogated. They are not dying of various accidents, or ending their lives in various ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, not long ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police officers summed up the truth, the more complicated the background and the communication, once they entered the police station because of certain things, if they could not go out in the first place, Basically, you don't have to go out. They know too many secrets, and these secrets are destined to be inaccessible to ordinary people, so only death is used to protect those secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not the same, his background is quite simple, and the only thing that is circulating is that Du Lin is a Heidele person who specializes in doing some dirty work for Heidler. Heidler is not a local, nor a native of the state. In addition to his race and other reasons, his hands and feet are not enough to reach the police station, and there is no way for a detainee to commit suicide. As for the accuracy of the news, it is not in the collection of information. On the contrary, when they spread the secrets they know, they often add fuel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know this person?", the deputy director of the police station, a middle-aged person who looks sick, his face is abnormally grayish white. Even in the cold autumn, there are still some sweat on the forehead and the side. His arms trembled so much that the photos he raised were constantly shaking. "This family has disappeared, and now their industry has become your site. Do you have anything to say about this?"林 <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at it, was a man in the family of three of the farm, he nodded, very calmly said: "I know him, he took his farm Sold to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Director... His name is Steven, a very common name, and there is a lack of presence in the police station. His physical condition has not been very good, and he is almost at home all year round. Fortunately, the director of Prando is fairly generous to the "self". Every month's salary and "subsidy" are distributed to the sick person, so that he can use enough money even if he does not work. To support the family and see a doctor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rarely comes to the police station, and only when he investigates some major cases, will he appear in the interrogation room of the police station. It has been rumored that this is a very powerful policeman. He has a clever head and a keen eye for observation. Few criminals can escape his trials and investigations. As for this rumor is not true, no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steven put the photo down, picked up the handkerchief and wiped the sweat from the side. "You killed him and his family...", Du Lin Slightly looked up, looking at the deputy director, the deputy director did not fear and did not shrink any more to meet his gaze, "You buy his farm in order to buy, and then after the formalities, you killed this home Man, snatched money that is no longer yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and shook his head. "If you have evidence to prove this directly, I Maybe it's really impossible to refute, but before that, it's all your assumptions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steven also laughed, he changed a topic, "You are very calm, really, I have been a policeman since the age of fourteen, and now it has been thirty years... thirty-one years, I have seen many criminals, violent, calm, crazy, There are metamorphosis, but they all have one thing in common, that is, there is enough age and social experience. I don’t want to say this. The world has forced them into such a situation, but I am very curious about what kind of environment has raised people like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stable, calm, bold You don't seem to care if I can find the evidence, and I'm sure I can't find any clues...", when he said it, he took the pen and recorded some information on the desktop book. "To tell the truth, I It is already certain that you are the murderer. A normal young person is facing an allegation of deliberate murder, even if he is really innocent, he will also show a series of psychological reactions such as nervousness, because they do not know that they will What to face, but you are calm, calm and a little scary!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think that as early as a while, you seem to have done everything well. I also confirmed that I was able to elute my own crimes, so you know that you will not have something, so calm, is that true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders "If I say yes, then this sentence Will it be one of the evidences against me? Sorry, I don't understand what you are saying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steven puts down his pen and looks at his head Sitting on the side of Prando, smiled and said: "The very awkward boy, also very smart, I believe these allegations should be true...", he picked up the right hand side of the table corner placed about one inch thick The file contains evidence of allegations of crimes committed by Du Lin and his fellow villagers. "But if we want to plead guilty, it may take a long time and it will be very difficult. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steven said it was straightforward and did not evade Doolin. According to imperial law, the involvement of the suspect’s lawyer must be after the first trial. This is to prevent lawyers from obtaining or changing some information through certain channels. Then explain it to the suspect and let him lie at the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four years ago, an outstanding actor was accused of cruelly killing his wife and his wife’s parents. After he was arrested, he refused to confess any one with the case. The content of the relationship, repeated emphasis on the need to be accompanied by a lawyer, will open. The first time he met with a lawyer was two months later. The lawyer who was outside the activity had a long time to get through all the relationships, and then he explained how he should face the trial when he met, so that he finally came to the end. The actor, with a series of evidence, was acquitted in court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For two months, the lawyer forged a real "mania" and "paranoia" mental illness certificate, of course, the first diagnosis and treatment The time was one year before the incident. He also used money to buy, not necessarily intimidate or use power to make all witnesses who testified in court unify the calibre - the actor's wife "in fact" has long been derailed, and her father has been drinking alcohol all the year round and often threatens the actor to kill him. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With so much evidence and half of the jury jury and the “help” of the judge, he regained his freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although people know what is going on, he succeeded in drilling a legal loophole, and the Imperial Parliament proposed amendments to the Defence Act. In the motion, the lawyer’s involvement in the case must be after the end of a trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are loopholes like seemingly targeted laws and regulations. As Kevin said, the more detailed the terms, the more vulnerabilities. This time, the loopholes are in the police department. How to interrogate, how strong the trial is, the police inside the police station have the final say. They used to need lawyers to buy passers-by. Now they need lawyers to buy the police first. They are the criminals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you throw away other factors, the first trial is really important. After the criminals are arrested, they must be in a state of unbalanced state of mind. Since they can be arrested, the police have obtained certain evidence, but it is not important to grasp the evidence. The guy sitting in the interrogated position is definitely not. know. Under such circumstances, it is highly probable to say something that should not be said, and these words will be used as the most direct and most favorable testimony for the final trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Doolin, Steven looked at Du Lin and sat down until now. He has discovered the difference between Doolin and others. He is too calm, and when he enters the door, he looks like a suspect who is going to be interrogated, just like going through a transition. Therefore, he decided to test Prando, Prando's silence made Steven understand that this case may have other internal conditions, so he decided to temporarily "abandon" this trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then as if he had gone through the game, he kept coming up with some evidence to accuse Du Lin of a possible criminal act that was calm and rational in Doolin. The answer evaded his responsibility. The more this, Steven thinks that there is a problem with this trial, and he has some doubts in his heart. What role should he play now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a question worth pondering. Living in this city, Steven has seen too many dark things, he never thought of himself. It is the party that upholds justice and justice, even if he has a badge that represents fairness and justice. Seriously, when he was serious, he was confused when he was confused. His body was very bad. He didn't want to die under a bullet instead of dying in a hospital bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen too much because he has ruined his life's descendants with a sense of justice, so he rationally chose the most appropriate way, confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said to Prando, this case is not easy to judge, which shows his serious attitude and also for his subsequent confusion. Ample paving. After the trial, Steven's notebook was filled with three pages of text material, but if you carefully read it line by line, it was written in some fart, without any substantive things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than an hour of trials came to an end, Steven completed his work in accordance with the process, quietly sighed. He will go to the hospital early in the morning to get the medicine. He doesn't want to waste his time for this case he can't do. When he closed the notebook, Du Lin also stood up. He went to the interrogation desk and looked at Steven, who was still sitting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inexplicably, this gave Steven a feeling of pressure. He looked at Du Lin cautiously, and Du Lin looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there any interest in working for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin opened his mouth, the nervous atmosphere suddenly Dissipated, but also made Steven a little dumbfounded, he shook his head in a dumb smile. "I am sorry, I have no idea of ​​changing jobs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
