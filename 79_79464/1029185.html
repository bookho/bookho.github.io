			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s remarks made everyone in the room relieved, and the problem was not terrible. The terrible thing was that no one was willing to take it and solve the problem. . At the same time, they are also very clear. If there is no accident, after the establishment of this small group, Du Lin’s authority must be greater than those of the people present, because he will solve a lot of troubles, so of course, in order to give him a gift. In return, everyone will let him master more power and voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fair thing, and this must be praised by all successful capitalists because they understand the concept of giving and returning. Someone who needs to be criticized is some unqualified politicians who always ask for it and never pay attention to it. This is very bad. Therefore, cooperation with businessmen, especially successful businessmen, is actually a very simple matter, a bargaining process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this problem has been solved, and more problems have been extended. For example, Ms. Sandra has something to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't mind if I insert a sentence?", she smiled and looked at other people, everyone was very gentleman's nod and said it didn't mind, Sandra I just looked at Du Lin with a smile. "Mr. Du Lin, I have a question to ask you. We all know that Mr. Mennon has implemented the 'Three Guarantees Policy' in the west, and this policy is very popular with locals. In particular, many local miners and families have purchased such policy benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Once Mr. Mennon is temporarily unable to hold any position due to physical discomfort, and the successor may not Will recognize the policy benefits he has already implemented, do you consider that the Westerners will stand up against the state government and even against all the businessmen?”, Sandra’s expression gradually became serious, “because these policies are Mr. Mennon signed with us together with the working class, Mr. Mennon is gone, and those people are very likely to bring fire to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We How should ? Solve this problem then "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Cassandra raised this issue very practical, but also a focus we are very concerned about. When their plan was to stop the implementation of the three-guarantee policy, Mr. Mennon was kicked out as a scapegoat to let the angry western farmer tear the pieces into the dog. But now there are changes in the plan. Mr. Mennon will leave the market first. Once Mr. Mennon leaves the market, they mean that they have become scapegoats for Mr. Mennon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angry flame burns not Mr. Mennon, but these capitalists. Capitalists are always exploiting workers, stealing money from their pockets in the pockets of ordinary people, legally or illegally, but the capitalists are equally inseparable from this group of people. If they can't solve this trouble, then they may not let Du Lin implement the plan for the time being, at least until they find a proper way, so that Mr. Mennon can take a responsible exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-guarantee policy was originally a double-edged sword. It always hurts a talent line. If they are not willing to be victims, who will become a victim? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is... Du Lin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that Ms. Sandra said is also the next question I want to say that is not in the topic of this gathering, that is, the three guarantee policy As Ms. Sandra said, Mr. Mennon will leave a mess after leaving, but please don't worry, I will take over the mess.” Du Lin took this sentence and even before and He was stunned by the angry Henry, because it was not part of ventilation, he did not know that Du Lin would say it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that Doolin is crazy, everyone recognizes the three guarantees policy because these policies can bring more benefits to everyone, more legitimate and reasonable exploitation of workers, and Reduce many of your responsibilities. But everyone knows that this is a dynamite barrel. If it happens, it will explode. The blood of the person holding the dynamite barrel is blurred. Why is Du Lin, a smart person who has already got everyone’s approval, will be very stupid? The dynamite bucket is in your arms? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at their surprised expressions very cozy, he liked the pleasure of crushing these arrogances on the IQ and strategy level, he wrapped his mouth, Shrugged his shoulders and said with a smile: "Maybe I am stupid?", he laughed when he finished, and he was a little ridiculous in front of these foggy big men. He laughed after he laughed a few times. Pleasure, continue to explain, "I will set up a company, Xema Insurance Company, yes, register with my last name, I will fully take over all individuals and collectives who have purchased the three-guarantee policy benefits. I have already said that, As an imperial person, I have some sense of social responsibility that may be redundant. I want to take some responsibility. This is what I have to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the heart of other people’s minds. They only started thinking about it at this time. Is there any huge interest in it? Otherwise, Dolin has multiple titles. The young man will take the explosives barrel desperately? But let them think about how to think about it, it is impossible to know what Du Lin is thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will donate no less than 10 million for this Xema Insurance Company. I think this is a profitable project, so I sincerely invite all of you here to join my plan. Of course, the company name will not Change, 52% of the absolute controlling interest will not change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms. Gentlemen, this will be an unprecedented opportunity, the miracle of the future The door is open to you, and this commitment is limited to this gathering."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quickest response here is Henry, because Henry’s to Dulin’s Knowing the most profound one, he watched it with his own eyes. He listened to Doolin when he was not rich. He pushed a trust group that monopolized the whole industry from the top of the mountain to the abyss. He knew that Du Lin was definitely not the kind of person who could suffer. People. But at the same time, he also had some doubts about Doolin's statement, because Mr. Roel has just proved that only a small amount of means is needed, and he can get huge compensation through fraudulent insurance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Profit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negative profit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negative profitability is also a profit. At least some of the evaluation agencies in Xie Lisi Street can often see the word, and it has succeeded in getting many people who don’t understand. when. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very itchy in his heart, he is sure that Dulin’s willingness to actively participate in the business will definitely make money – as long as anyone who has studied Doolin knows this, he has never Do not make a loss-making business, even if it seems that there is a loss, but in the long run will inevitably bring profits. But knowing that it is known, this is like a man who won ninety-nine games at the gambling table. He told you that he can make the last game, even if you believe it, but there is still an uncontrollable thought in the heart. The seaweed dances like a seaweed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In case, lose? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be seeking psychological comfort, or it may be that Doolin wants to cheer for himself. Henry licked his lips and asked: "Mr. Doolin, you... can make sure Is it profitable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked like Henry as a child with intellectual disabilities, and Henry felt that he had asked a very stupid person. The problem. If you can ensure profitability, with his current status and status, he is not qualified enough to meet Du Lin, let alone face to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Du Lin still answered him very lovingly. "The bigger the income, the greater the risk. I am not sure if I can guarantee my profit, but I will try my best to work in this direction." Della, "How? This is how I solve this problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, no one asked Du Lin about the Sigma Insurance Company. Things have happened. They never put their own money and money that is not their own into an unfamiliar field because of impulsiveness or emotional influence. Even if they hide the Jinshan Yinhai, they will not. By their status, the resources they have are not only their personal, but also the company, all shareholders, including money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have no right to invest in a possible field with the company’s money, and the board cannot approve such absurd decisions. As for their own money, it is more cost-effective to buy stocks of the company. At least the equity in their own hands is more, and the weight is more important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have no problem, if you can promise, this is of course the best solution.", Sandra regained her gaze and stared at her hand. The diamond ring on the eye doesn't turn around, I don't know what to think about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and looked at everyone again, "So who still has a problem?", waiting for about five minutes, no one is talking, he I continued to say: "Since everyone has reached an agreement, should we consider between us..." He reached out and drew a circle in front of him. "What should I call such a party?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the beginning of the formation of interest groups. Compared with the things just mentioned, everyone is more interested in this aspect and speaks one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of Doolin’s initiative, this small group no longer has any names such as committees and associations that seem to have too much desire. Instead, they use a very Unremarkable name - West Country Club. The name looks very earthy, in fact, it is very suitable for the evil taste of the ladies and gentlemen here. Wrapping a powerful interest group with a vulgar name is a very interesting thing in itself, and it is also low-key enough to be less noticeable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one would think that a small organization called the "Western Country Club" would be an organization that controls the entire western business, economy, trade, and even politics. Everyone is very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
