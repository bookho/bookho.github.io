			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People are dead?", the person answering the phone repeated a sentence in surprise, then hung up the phone, he hesitated and knocked on Tynel The study of the mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter is closing his eyes at this time, full of brains how to spend this crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that Vivienne will definitely ask the Governor to intervene, with the contacts and relationships of the Governor, and his own struggle for ten years. . There is no doubt about this. At the age of Peter, he became more and more aware that being a politician, the cheapest and most precious thing is friendship. The reason why friendship is cheap is because weigh the pros and cons when necessary, and it is not difficult to decide to sell more political interests. And everyone can find a lot of reasons for their betrayal and betrayal behavior, such as "I am thinking for you", or "I am doing this for you" is a grand excuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friendship is precious, and the friendship that can be maintained for decades in such a cruel and realistic political arena shows that the value of this friendship itself has exceeded the political Value, such friendship needs to be maintained, and it is necessary to constantly irrigate fresh rain and dew. The energy and benefits invested in it cannot be calculated at all. The purpose of doing this is to harvest itself, perhaps a promise, perhaps a guarantee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a variety of attacks in the next period, including from the inside of the old party, from the new party, and even from public opinion. He must be prepared and ready to do everything, otherwise he will really lose everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his eyes, and the tired look flashed from his eyes. If Wei Wei is not too tight, he will not be able to come up with such an approach and let people perform it. If it is not for the woman who is not willing to maintain the last decent, he will never do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" he asked, yelling at the temple and making a yawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steward lowered his head and stood at the door. "The driver died. In the morning, they found that the driver was sleeping, and wanted to wake him up, but found him." The neck was broken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter frowned, the driver was absolutely his own, including his friends who told him that the driver did not explain anything. I didn't expect to die overnight. Who will move, is the Governor? Perhaps this is possible, this may be the first step for Vivienne's revenge on herself. Killing the driver is to make her feel the determination and strong desire for her revenge. This woman is too naive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Peter felt that he could not let the freedom of things develop, and he should take the initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, let other people do it.", Peter squeezed his fist, and he didn’t know when he had a layer of oil and sweat. Something tired is not good. He picked up the face towel on the table and wiped his hand, then said: "As long as I can pass this level, I promise that they will do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In addition to arranging people to try to murder his wife Vivian, Peter also prepared a series of follow-up plans. If it wasn't for Vivi's life, it would be necessary for these follow-up plans to be implemented. Because these plans are implemented, they are destined to continue to stand in the old party. All the connections and relationships that he has operated for more than a decade will become waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no way, he has been forced to this step, considering the time of two days, if it is not the death of the driver that prompted him to make up his mind, maybe he still I have to wait a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler’s face was abruptly retired, and before leaving, he was very formal, and as a contact, he knew that something big would happen. After leaving the room, he changed into a casual suit, took the bus to a remote street, and found a telephone booth to dial a number. When the other party was connected, no one spoke. It was about thirty seconds after silence. He hung up the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other end of the phone, a middle-aged Chinese character with a sly smile on his face, he walked back to the side of the house and clap his hands and shouted One sentence "worked", a group of equally powerful guys got out of each room. They put on more convenient clothes, carrying huge travel bags, and then went out to take four different cars and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as half a month ago, they had already negotiated conditions with two intermediaries and Peter. They killed everyone in the Governor’s House, including the over-reported Governor and his daughter Vivian. After the event, they would give them one million in cash and arrange a new federal identity for them to become a person. The rich man who is envied by man has lived a happy life ever since. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many dangerous things for those who are bloody, aren’t they just spending the rest of their lives for the rest of their lives? As long as you give money, these guys who dare to do anything for money will not care about their own lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them gathered around the Governor's Mansion. One of the guys climbed the roof of a residential building on the side of the Governor's Mansion. He found a good place to take out a rifle that was obviously transformed. And also installed an expensive lens set. After fiddling and changing several sets of lenses, I finally found the one he was satisfied with. He picked up a mirror and took photos of an alley opposite him. Several companions dressed in electric circuit maintenance workers walked out of the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They went outside the Governor’s Gate and climbed onto the poles that connected the Governor’s Circuit...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At this time, Buddha has returned to Turner. He already knows all the passing of the matter. Perhaps he has had such a speculation, so he did not seem surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do?" Keina asked as he licked the ribs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes to eat this thing too much, the meat is tied with ribs and aponeurosis, there are some fat, biting up, not stuffing, there will be The strong flavour of the stock blasted in the mouth as it chewed. Every time I think of Turner's grilled beef ribs, he can't help but swallow a few mouthfuls of water. Looking at the three full beef ribs in the plate, Kina raised his hand and shook. "Boss, come back three!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With one of his own plates and the other three, he suddenly felt that two people were not a person of the world at all. He put down the half of the beef ribs and wiped the greasy mouth and said: "When you know that the first king led many generals to stand outside the kingdom of Sabis, what did he say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an allusion to the Guar people. The Sabine Kingdom suffered a drought more than a thousand years ago. In order to pass on the damage and get enough food to appease the domestic famine. Unrest, the king of the Kingdom of Sabis acquiesced to the soldiers under his command, and the citizens entered the territory of the Guate Kingdom without looting the war. Not only did they snatch many foods and animals, but they also killed many good Guart citizens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the king learned of the extraordinary anger, he immediately pulled out the long sword at the waist, and read the war in the direction of Wang Duo pointing to the Kingdom of Sabis. The declaration, and led the fearless soldiers, from the border to the king of Sabis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment when the soldiers came to the city, he stood in front of tens of thousands of troops and said loudly: "Love can't turn hatred, benevolence can't save the undead, death can only With death to exchange, hatred only uses blood to calm down, my soldiers, take the head of King Sabis to my feet, and burn the whole kingdom with angry flames!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an epic war – this was the case for the Guars, and the head of King Sabis was cut into two pieces, tied together with hemp rope and then dedicated to the first king of the bloody battle. The first king went down to the horse and lifted his foot to crush the head of King Sabis. From then on, he had a population of 1.8 million, and the Kingdom of Sabis, which had been established for more than 100 years, was destroyed. All Sabis people have become slaves, or corpses, which is also the prelude to the unification of the entire Western world by the Guarts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kinna smiled. "Do you still do it? If I do, his head may not be able to keep it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha sighed. "I am coming, there are some things to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the evening at the City Hall Peter didn't go home immediately. At the meeting, he already felt that the officials under his hand began to move closer to the members. Whenever they had any questions that they needed to express their views, they would first look at the attitude of Mr. This made Peter very unhappy. He has not been taken down by people. This group of people has already begun to find a way out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he can’t say anything, he can only suffocate his stomach. So he wants to relax and doesn't want to go home right away. After today, it is either smooth sailing or ruining his own future and destiny. On the last night, he allowed himself to indulge himself, only once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put on a casual suit and found a bar. At this time, no one in the dim light recognized that this guy was the highest chief executive in the city. While drinking alcohol, he looked at the two women who were sweating and hot enough to be unwilling to take off their clothes. He didn't know that when he looked at the women, some people were watching him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are never two kinds of people in the bar, one is to entertain and entertain, the other is to find opportunities to make money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people will make money through some kind of body fluid exchange, but some people use knives to make money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter changed a hundred pieces of change when he entered the door. This is enough for some people to pay attention to him. He also ordered the best wine, which is obviously The best goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a girl with a heavy makeup went to Peter’s side, and the body fell directly on him like no bones supported. “Please give me a drink? "The girl licked her lips and made a movement that she thought was the most tempting." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
