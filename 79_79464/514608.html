			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the sentry box at Maixiang Garden, a casual wear The young police officer looked back at a group of people who came out of Wood Villa and retracted their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was asked by Prando to stay here, and if he saw the massive transfer of Wood’s people, he immediately reported it to the police station and reported it to Prang. many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young police officer did not face the horror and nervousness of the gang war. It was a kind of excitement and yearning for young people. He is also a young man. He also has the instigation and uneasiness of young people. He also yearns to do something through his own strength. He is not much different from the gangs who wander around the streets and do nothing. If there is, it may be that his family is in good condition. At least he will have a decent job after leaving school, and he does not need to run around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police are indeed a decent job, but not necessarily a job that will satisfy young people. This job is suitable for the elderly to care for the elderly, but not suitable for the world is still full of curiosity, young people who are full of fantasy about their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three... No, four cars quickly drove out of the wheat garden, and the young police officers looked at the one full of people. The car slammed the fist with force. He immediately pushed the unlocked bicycle and prepared to catch up. The old police officer who partnered with him held down his arm and struggled for a moment without struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old policeman shook his head and persuaded: "Listen to me, don't go, you are a policeman, more dangerous than others."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young policeman said in reverse: "Because I am a policeman, I must go. You tell the Secretary that Wood may take someone to revenge, I I have already kept up.", he said that he opened the hand of the old policeman and rushed out on his bicycle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old policeman called a few words behind him, and he did not return his head, leaving only his back and the name that was still echoing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ekato! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old policeman shook his head and could only push another bicycle in the direction of the police station, slamming the pedals of the bicycle, hoping to hurry up. Go back to that safe place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news quickly returned to the Tnell City Police Department, and Prando also knew the news. In the face of Wood's revenge, he was able to make few choices. Either take everyone to stop this battle of revenge - maybe he can let Wood leave, but this is only temporary, and today, Wood will still take people to Queen Street to find Du Lin. And there is another risk in it. If Du Lin runs away because of his interference, the account will be counted on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wood grabs Doolin or how it’s okay, once Doolin slips completely, Wood, who has nowhere to vent, will definitely aim at Yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never thought that his police chief was sacred and inviolable. Even the Imperial Prime Minister was assassinated for two times. He was a small local police station. The Secretary, why dare to say that he is not afraid of any threat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for pretending to know nothing, there will be trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gang wars have always been very sensitive words, especially for those politicians who want to be sing and dance in the sphere of their rule. Thriving. If something happens to wake them up, these politicians who are always smiling will not be smiling. As the main person in charge of the security of the city of Tener, he was inevitably the first to be questioned, and may be dismissed from the investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a possibility of offending the tycoon, threatened by the tycoon, while the other side is losing his official hat and the chair under the butt, he only thought for a moment, A decision was made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to intervene in this matter, not to say what to mediate, it is also appropriate to restrain. Whenever he asked, he didn't have much responsibility. After all, he tried his best, but the equipment of the Tenel City Police Department was backward. The police officers were old. He made the best effort but still did not have any Method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing does not blame him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of this, he immediately asked his secretary to inform the police officers in the police station, wearing equipment and police equipment, ready to dispatch. Speaking of this, he remembered another headache. Two police officers who patrolled at night during the night disappeared inexplicably. The family members of the missing police officers came to the police station for several days before they were told to move and went back to wait for the news. I don't know if these two dead ghosts were sinned, or they did something unspeakable and ran away, but left the mess to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the police officers who were able to attend the event were ready to be dispatched, a 30-year-old sheriff asked: "Secretary, are we riding a bicycle and starting to drive?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando’s eyes glimpsed, “Of course it’s gone!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some old police officers who are nervous about hearing this sentence suddenly Relaxed and walked over? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the 11th Street to Queen Street, it takes about fifteen minutes to walk faster, and it’s not too much to go slowly for half an hour. From the police station to get the news until now, Wood people are probably already in Queen Street? When they walked over, I am afraid that the battle will be finished, the bodies are all cold, and when they go, they will be out of work, and by the way, they will be the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As these people think, four cars packed with people parked downstairs in the Doolin industry, looking at the lifeless house, Wood The eyelids jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure they are all inside?", he glanced at Robben who pushed the door down from the driver's seat. "But I think there should be no one inside." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roben is also looking at the corner building, through the huge glass windows on the first floor, you can see the newly renovated furnishings, but Can't see a person. The curtains were pulled on the second and third floors, and the situation inside could not be seen. He was hesitant and looked around. At this time, a man with a high-necked trench coat and a domed felt hat, wrapped himself out of the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is people still inside?" Robben asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man nodded, sucking the last cigarette, throwing the cigarette butt on the ground, lifting his foot and grinding it. "I saw Du Lin with my own eyes." I haven’t come out yet, they are still there.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roben looked at Wood, Wood waved, didn’t even say anything, two The hand on the first floor of the window directly led by the hand of the stick, opened the door from the inside. At least twenty people rushed in, one by one, not a stick, a mountain knife, and two people holding a pistol in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
