			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, thank you very much... yes, I will check this out as soon as possible, ok, goodbye...", Mason hangs up after the call Looking up at the small police officer who was wronged at the door, the small police officer was a policewoman. The blond hair and black eyes made her have a different temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone also said Mason’s strange words in private, saying that his assistant to the director is not just an assistant. The gods testify that the assistant is really just the director. Assistant, her enthusiasm is full of enthusiasm, to treat the work seriously, treat the superiors with modesty and courtesy, all the strange words to her are malicious, malicious slander, this Mason can testify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he called, the assistant knocked on the door and was driven out by him. This call is very important. Du Lin has told him that he is going to fight for the election. After the members or the mayor, Mason has a new impetus and is actively putting it into action. He had very effective communication with some local entrepreneurs and revealed the fact that he was going to participate in the election, which made him very busy during this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tnel City is a very remote place, there are not many companies that can get the most out of it, most of them are related to the transportation industry, and some Light industry enterprises. These companies include more than 80% of local jobs. It can be said that their positions stand for the position of the entire Tener City voters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capitalism never needs to personally end, it can interfere with the results of the campaign, only need to release a wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason still has a great chance of winning in this general election. He served as the director of the two police stations in Tener. The first was investigated by the state. Directly designated by the bureau. After the Golden Robbery, the state government was dissatisfied with the stagnation of this case by the city of Tener, and it was aware that the Tenel Regional Police Department may have a major duty crime. Even the then director, Prando, died in the fire. Explain the seriousness, so the investigation team was sent to sort out the police station from top to bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not check, I don’t know, I’m scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the director to the lowest level patrol, more than 70% of the entire police station colluded with the then director, Prando, and formed A division of labor clearly organizes the hierarchical black police group. They continually search the city's wealth by collecting various black money and security fees, and provide protection for certain gangs and forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigation team immediately applied for reinforcements to the state government, and then all the police officers were included in the investigation. In the end, the vast majority of police officers were sent to prison for alleged crimes, waiting for them for these years. They sent in kind greetings to the "good friends" who have not yet come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this big review, some police officers also performed very well. For example, some young people who entered the police system, such as Mason, are precisely because they still Very young, and this sense of blood and justice, they were not included in the black police organization by Prando, but also made the face of the then mayor Peter a little better, at least the Tenel Regional Police Department was not all bad. Finish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor has directly appointed a new director in order to implant a nail in the jurisdiction of the old party. The director is trying to show his ability. Constantly challenging Peter's nerves, and finally after Peter was stabbed to death, Mason successfully took over the work of the local police chief because of the lack of work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly transferred mayor has no absolute control over the city after the end of the first term, and does not want to launch a political struggle, so the current Officials, this also allowed Mason to successfully take the second job. Now, it’s not that easy to get rid of Mason. The police department is involved in all aspects of society. It’s not just about catching people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruling class that Prando was able to squeeze into the city was not only Peter’s appreciation, but he himself also had great power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Mason wants to stand for election. When he releases the wind, many capitalists start to contact him and promise to build momentum for him. Compared with Mason, a local official who can meet the needs of the transfer of interests, other similar members and mayors are all fed up with white-eyed wolves. If they give them more money, they will only think that this is appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most striking feature of the old party’s rule, with a complete chain of interest, extracted from the bottom, and intercepted through layers of transmission. Finally, I entered the old party committee and used it for all aspects of the development of the old party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this kind of rule has many drawbacks, many people like this system, because as long as you give enough money, as long as you know one or two The key people, then it is not impossible to live in a society. This is easier than the New Party’s free competition. At least they don’t need to consider the issue of losing money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Mason was beckoning to the assistant. "The phone call was very important. Is there anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female assistant has some small grievances but no performance. When she came out, she nodded and pointed to the door and said, "There are two young people outside, saying that it is your younger brother. I don't know them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mason glanced and stood up. He heard that Du Lin had to pay a little attention to Du Lin’s current situation after he married the Timamont family, so that he had a feeling that those capitalists are willing to support him. There must be Du Lin’s influence to play a role. After all, although there are not many people who can get the hand of the Timamont family, there is only one, but even one is the most amazing one, the Imperial Prime Minister! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many people who know Mason’s relationship with Doolin, but there are definitely a lot of them. I really want to know what I can do. When Du Lin designed to play tricks, Also with Mason played a "six parents do not recognize" drama, and many people know about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect Du Lin to get engaged, but actually went to Turner. He wanted to understand the next moment. He must go home to see Mr. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go see it...", Mason said, pushing the door of the office, just to see Du Lin and Dudu together. Smoking on the window sill, two young little policemen are staring at them, these people are too arrogant, actually ran to the police station to smoke, and Du Lin ... is definitely not a good person, must be fixed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the consensus of all the people in the city of Tener. It has been going on for many years, but people still remember that there was a time when the whole city of Tener was Under a cloud, Doolin's rise is accompanied by countless bloodshed and death, which is a wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only a little more than a slap, but also a special cross! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come you?", Mason laughed and walked over and hugged Doolin, then took Du Lin into his office and let The two new little police officers are a little confused, and some secrets are not secret to a certain level of people, but for the lower class, the secret is always a secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged. "If I don't come back, Mr. Xema will go to Otis to swear at me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you have to get engaged?", after closing the door of the office, Mason took two from the music box on the table to Du Lin and Dudu, and he also took a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the land in his hand and was a high-end goods. The high-end land is from the origin, that is, the king of the dying province of Yawang Dynasty. As for the fungus produced by the mycelium transplanted to other places, the taste of the land is not pure enough. It is a pity that the production of the fungus hyphae in the place of origin has not been able to go up. The group of people who are too lazy to eat the oysters guard the "wild" selling point, passively harvesting a wave every year, and then waiting for the harvest season of the coming year, is true Lying down to make money, but it also makes the locals more lazy, but also exclusive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s hand was thrown at the Buddha, and he gently opened his mouth with a hand on the cigarette holder, and he took it back and sucked it up. One bit, I tweeted. "You are corrupt, Mason, even this kind of high-end goods are placed on the table, are you afraid of being reported? Now check the crimes of the duty is very strict, be careful to be locked in."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason listened to his eyebrows and snorted. "Who asked me to have a rich brother?", Doolin wants to make sure that Mason won't lose money because of money. The position was also closed, and he gave Mason enough support. The money thing may be just a symbol and a string of numbers for Du Lin, and there is no longer any practical significance. Every month, he will remit money to his family, more or less, but it is definitely enough for them to live and to a certain extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who has the ability, he will give more, and he wants to eat and die, and he will give less. Going to the point where he is today, in addition to trying to complete his ultimate pursuit, the family is left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and shook his head, then glanced at the office renovation, and finally stared at Mason’s face. “What I asked you to do, How are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason took a sip of his face, his face relaxed a little, he went to the table and sat back, after seven or eight About 90 seconds later, I said, "I have contacted most of the local celebrities. They said they would support me, but I am not sure if they are telling the truth." He sighed. "You know, after all, this is the site of the old party. If there is no strong person behind me to support me, it is still difficult to pass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said To be honest, it is absolutely impossible to run for the non-party or new party on the old party's territory. If he joins the old party, then his goal can only be placed on the members of the party. The mayor is also impossible. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
