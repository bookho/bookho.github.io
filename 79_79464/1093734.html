For the operation of the country, the financial mechanism, and the economic construction, these officials have a more acute sense of smell than ordinary people. The collapse of a small export company means that more small and micro enterprises are facing all the problems that the failed company has experienced. In the case of a sudden increase in cost growth income, it is very difficult to maintain it. There are always some expenses that entrepreneurs can't afford, such as staff salaries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the re-adjustment of tariffs between the federal and the empire also made these SMEs exporting by dumping difficult, and their goods were canceled. Under the empire market is no longer competitive, such as some companies that produce lighters. They used to unscrupulously dump their goods to the empire, occupying the empire's market with a large amount of trade and cheaper prices. But with the restoration of tariffs, the prices of their goods in the empire are no longer so attractive, and the empire's own products are more popular with the market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are certainly shadows in bright places. Everything has always been divided into positive and negative sides, with both good and bad sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deputy minister of the Ministry of Finance said immediately, "This is not in conflict with our previous plan, gentlemen, let go of the relationship with the Imperial Star exchange rate. And opening up a bigger market is our most important plan now. Before we did these things, we have already understood that the financial and economic markets within the Federation will inevitably face a certain degree of impact, including the collapse of some enterprises. This is the inevitable pain that we have to bear from the past. We have been cultivating the empire’s power for more than 20 years. We have used the empire’s market to raise a large number of outstanding enterprises. Under the natural competition elimination mechanism of the market, some people have obtained Success, then there must be someone who needs to face failure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just that these people are unfortunately one of the losers, a rigid business philosophy I don’t know the idea of ​​change, what makes them face failure is not the change of national policy, they are themselves. They can’t change the direction of business operation in time, change existing business projects and Mind, they will inevitably be eliminated by the market. Let us focus on those successful companies. In the past two decades, the Federation has produced more than 130 outstanding and excellent multinational large trading companies. I want to trade. The problems that the ministers are worried about are actually not a problem in themselves. Do we not do these things, will these companies not go bankrupt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, we are not formulating new policies, pushing the market to face the world faster. They will be struggling in the face of losing competitiveness. In the end, they will go bankrupt and be forced to liquidate. We all understand that the market is cruel, we They can sympathize with their experiences, but they cannot change our existing policies because of their current situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The members of the Joint Council and the Speakers The situation has shown optimism, let us focus on those successful companies, they do not need special support to be able to gain a foothold in international trade, and continue to grow themselves, this is what we need The object of concern. As for the small businesses, I don’t think we need to pay too much attention.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main federal policies and plans are now to promote the federal shield In the course of becoming an international currency, the Ministry of Trade had talked about entrepreneurs of many multinational companies in the past week. They proposed an idea that is required in foreign trade. Business firm federal shield as a settlement currency. It seems that this is a very stupid thing, adding to the trade process, those foreign import and export companies need to take the federal shield to trade with the federal merchants. But on the other hand, the federal shield's accelerated expansion of the international scope has a very good effect on their ultimate goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people are used to leaving some federal shields in their pockets, they are used to using the federal shield for settlement currency in international trade, the Commonwealth of the Union and the Commonwealth The international influence of the shield will be rapidly improved and eventually become the mainstream settlement currency. By that time, the entire world market had to comply with federally established business rules and, in some cases, pay for federal economic development. The influence and benefits brought by it far exceed the wave of the collapse of some small enterprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second minister of the Ministry of Trade smiled and nodded. In fact, he is also very aware that the closure of small and micro enterprises at this stage is a self-regulation of the market mechanism. The profitability of large enterprises began to increase, the income of small enterprises began to decrease, and the transfer of profits caused these “disabled” enterprises to be eliminated, using their post-bankruptcy nutrients and vacant markets to encourage “sound” enterprises to strengthen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But... there is always some concern. Once the wave of bankruptcy is formed, it may cause some problems in the society, the unemployment rate will increase, and the number of idle property personnel will increase. The problem of law and order will eventually evolve into more complicated social problems in a short period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vice Minister of Finance continued, "I will inform you first that next month, the central bank will continue to cut interest rates to stimulate the market and issue some other financial policies. To activate the activity of the federal financial market, I hope that everyone can cooperate as much as possible while detecting market volatility..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the second minister did not say that after the discussion at the Supreme Council's highest meeting, he decided to issue a new batch of federal shields. Simply put, he printed the banknotes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the international currency market, the Federal Shield is now popular among investors from all over the world. It has been determined that there will be no ups and downs in a short period of time. A stable and firm posture continues to rise. Rising prices will strengthen investor confidence, which will make the amount of currency in circulation less. In order to spread the influence of the Federal Shield as soon as possible, the Joint Parliament made such a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, printing a batch of currency will reduce the price of the federal shield, but this is definitely within the acceptable range, the domestic think tank thinks this move Will allow the federal shield's exchange rate to decline in a short period of time, and will also release a clear signal that the general federal shield is insufficient, which will further stimulate investors' confidence in the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news is indeed not suitable for premature disclosure. For the federal financial economy, the Ministry of Finance has always had great confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams is the sole shareholder of a small import and export trading company, and his product has only one thing - a blanket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past ten years, he has made a lot of money, enough for him to live in the villa area of ​​Shangcheng District, driving high-end luxury cars, and getting in and out of some needs. Qualified high-end venues, even with his family, have enjoyed everything. To this day, he can't forget his factory working overtime to add crazy manufacturing blankets and then package dumping into the empire. The dealers on the empire sent him several telegrams every day, urging him to transport the goods as soon as possible to deal with the crazy market. He is a part of the dumping army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many such people around him. It is definitely a glory era worthy of everyone’s recollection. Countless people use all the mortgages they own, holding It’s really a golden age when the money goes to start a simple factory and then profit from the empire’s madness. No matter what is produced, in short, as long as you sell to the empire, you must make money. If you dare to gamble, you will definitely win. Until now, it is still something people talk about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, his cheap blankets won the favor of the low-income people of the empire, and a blanket of two stars had a gross profit of about 35 percent, which made He became a successful person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But recently his good days have come to an end. Even if the federal government gave him a tax rebate and subsidy policy, after the tariff was restored, his product sales price in the Imperial Terminal has risen to three and two, and the gross profit is only 10%. In other words, he basically does not make money by selling things, but earns meager profits by tax rebates and subsidies. In the market where the empire has recovered, the competitiveness is very poor. Compared with the blankets produced by the two 49-point empire, their blanket sales are worrying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dealer has called him more than once to cut the volume of purchases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he sat in the bank’s credit department office and looked at a loan document in front of him. He wanted to mortgage the villa he had lived for more than eight years. Exchange the bank for a loan to maintain current production and operations. He didn't know where the road was, and he didn't know how to change. More than once, the City Hall has brought these small entrepreneurs to a meeting, telling them to transform, to be flexible, to keep up with the pace and policies of the times. But he is the chairman of a small business. He is not an economist. He knows what those words and words mean, but he doesn't know how to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that can be done now is to maintain your own business, maybe the market will have a good day, I heard that several areas have just ended the war, there are very Big market space, maybe he can work hard in this regard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he picked up his pen and signed his name, the manager sitting opposite him was like a smile, "Mr. Williams, Your loan will be credited to your account within three hours. You have six months to control the money. If you are unable to return the loan principal and interest after six months, follow the terms of our contract. We may collect your house and auction it, good luck!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams shook a smile and shook hands with the department manager. The other party gave him a business card and said something that made him unhappy. For example, if he still needs it, he can contact the manager directly, which will save them a lot of steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bitch is raised, this is cursing me! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams had a smile on his face but his heart was dark, and he had to show a smile to make him feel bad. Watching Williams' departure manager smiled and shook his head. Recently, many SMEs began to seek loans to maintain the normal operation of the company, but have to say that the effect is not good, there are already a few small Enterprises lost their collateral because they did not have the loan principal and interest. In addition to continuing to obtain more financial support from banks in the same way as selling, they simply cannot alleviate the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
