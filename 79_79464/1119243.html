			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think?", Magus squinted at Doolin and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He appreciates this young man very much. From the age of forty, everyone respects him or fears him, but Du Lin is an exception. No visitor will ever sleep in his home. Even if there are important things that are said to be two or three days in the middle of the night or even later, these people will leave very actively and will not add any trouble to Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Du Lin is not like this. He came after lunch, and asked about the etiquette. After all, he is about to face the royal family. If you make a rude move, it will make him very faceless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person has to make hundreds of amazing things to make most people admire him, look at him, but just do something indecent Things, soon most people will laugh at him. This is unfair because fairness is not in the hands of the weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief introduction to the court etiquette..., no later, then Du Lin casually took a book and sat in Magus’s study. Then, looking at Magus, he heard the grunt, and Du Lin actually fell asleep on the sofa. He couldn't forget that at that moment he had a sense of ignorance. He didn't know if he should politely call Du Lin and tell him that he accidentally fell asleep in his study. If he is very sleepy, there are still some rooms in the villa that have not been used for decades but can be cleaned every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or... regardless of him, let him sleep here for a while? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading books can all fall asleep, should he be tired during this time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, Magus was dumbfounded, how many people in the entire empire and even the whole world wanted to chat with him in this study, but this bastard actually I fell asleep here. Magus smiled and shook his head, and clipped the book he was looking at, and quietly left the study. Then he woke up Du Lin, who was sleeping and mouting. He never heard that Du Lin would mout on his sleep, and of course he wouldn't ask about it. It made him feel very interesting, and then Du Lin laughed at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in essence, Magus still quite appreciates Doolin, not everyone can sleep in the face of the first person of the Empire, and then fall asleep It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is definitely one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin seems to have forgotten the shackles of the recent time. He caressed the half-wall covered by the mottled shadow, the moss in the bricks and many The ancient traces indicate what kind of years the wall has survived. It is a pity that it is really just a wall, and it is no longer a representative of some kind of honor and power. People don't use the walls of the palace to describe a circle, and it won't be anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and said with a smile, "I have fulfilled a wish...", watching Magus show his appearance, Du Lin chuckled. Two sounds, "In fact, there is nothing. When I was a child, I always felt that the palace was far away from myself. Now that I grow up, I really discovered that it is really far away from me, even if I can touch it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus chewed on this sentence, and he immediately woke up and kept the meter without saying anything. He understood what Du Lin said. When he was a child, he thought that the most powerful person in the world was the emperor who lived in the palace. Now he grows up, no longer simple. He realizes that he wants exactly what he does not have here. Although it is only a feeling, it is full of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two entered the palace one after the other, the soldiers did not stop them, let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the palace, Du Lin was a little disappointed. It is accurate to say that this palace does not have the grandeur of his dream, more magnificent, like... ... what the nouveau riche used to display. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is quietly behind Margots, but Magus can clearly feel that before he comes in, no matter what Du Lin has. Feeling, he is looking forward to it. But since he came in, he became calmer, which made him curious. Is it not luxurious and honorable, or is he sublimated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus is an old man who always keeps curiosity. When a person has curiosity, he will have enough awe, he can’t help but ask One sentence, "Do you think it is normal here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded, "more than I thought!", Magus exposed When he had an unexpected expression, he smiled and said, "I thought I could feel a top-down oppression when I walked in, and I couldn’t suppress the awe and fear, but I didn’t actually feel it. The palace that I saw was just an external manifestation of productivity, and honestly it was very vulgar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
