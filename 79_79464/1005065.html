			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Mines have great dominance among the mine owners in the west. This dominance comes from the product of “capital collaboration”, simply speaking After a new company has demanded metal ore, they will send their own demand to the West Mine. The West Mine will refer to the other party’s request and give a “guidance” recommendation. The supply and demand sides reached a deal. Of course, these companies can also contact the mines over the West Mine and get enough metal ore from their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this kind of behavior is a very disgusting behavior in business, whether it is the mine owner in the west or the demand side outside the west, it will all be the same. Follow the rules of “capital collaboration”. These rules are not explicitly presented in front of people by writing records, but these rules do exist, and the person who knows knows that this way can also be regarded as a kind of capital power to its own unique nature. Maintenance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing the West Mine, will you buy ore from the mine owners in the west? There is certainly no problem. The West Mine will not be strong enough to be able to constrain the spontaneous trading behavior, but the West Mine will be able to restrain its members and no longer provide a pound of raw ore to the blacklisted companies. They can Other metal smelters buy metal ingots, but in the west, they don't get any pounds of ore. The blacklisted mine owners will also enjoy the same treatment, and the West Mine will no longer recommend their ore to the outside world, and they will be permanently frozen by the West Mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a kind of self-issuance of the industry. Some economists believe that this "capital cooperation" means is one of the important characteristics of industry self-protection. Prefaced trade behavior can play a significant role in stabilizing the relationship between the market and the supply and demand sides, and such behavior is not only between the mine owners in the west, but in almost all industries involving trade behaviors. law. People will defend it spontaneously and will not blindly destroy it, because the benefits of destruction are far less than the benefits of maintenance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin is obviously a saboteur, and the behavior he has shown has made the members of the Western Mining Association feel a great threat. Building a building can take a long time, cost a lot, and consume a lot of manpower. But to destroy a building, it can take a few minutes. He opened a bad head for the mine owners in the west, so the all-round boycott of Du Lin became the main task of the West Mine, and Du Lin was also in the first place on the blacklist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such circumstances, Mr. Hendry is actually planning to sell his mine to Doolin, even if it is a waste mine that will not produce any more. It is also a somewhat shocking news. Does he want to challenge too? What about the nerves of the executives of the West Mine? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But obviously, everyone’s brain circuit is not here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much is he willing to pay? Does he know the actual situation?" The small miner who first asked this question couldn’t help but ask, he was very Concerned about this news, because his mining industry has entered the countdown stage, he must choose a retreat for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hendley looked around again to make sure that no one who did not belong to them was close to here, and whispered: "Mr. Doolin is more rumored than There are so many gentlemen, I can't believe that the rumors imposed on him are true. This must be from the smearing of some people with hidden evil minds. Of course, I explained my in a slightly artistic way. In the case of Mine No. 3, Mr. Doolin is very generous and willing to invest 700,000 yuan to buy mine, and pay a fee for the equipment and related personnel on the mine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When the words came out, the people around them showed their surprised faces. The value of a waste mine in the west is probably...not worth it. It is not necessary for anyone to buy this kind of non-mine, because according to the current laws in the west, the area of ​​one square kilometer needs to solve at least 55 people's employment problems. Any mining area will not be only one square kilometer. If the privatized land area is too small, maybe the blank land next to it will be bought, and then everyone will dig faster than anyone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing has not happened, even today, as long as you don’t pay attention, this will happen. The deposit is deep under the ground, and the ghost knows how long and how wide the complete mine is. There will always be some leaking people trying to dig down outside the land that has been discovered and privatized. The risk is much lower than that of my own exploration. Even if it fails, it is nothing more than wasting some time and some slaves. The equipment is not dead. It is determined that no deposits will be extended. This group of cheap gold diggers will leave immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to buy a scrap mine with 700,000 yuan and buy equipment, and Du Lin will pay at least one million dollars for the transaction. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a waste mine in exchange for one million dollars..., this sale is obviously very cost-effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you afraid of the executives interfering with this matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hendley laughed. "I have reported this to the executives, they There is no comment on this, which means they don't care, or support my behavior!", he said that he is still somewhat proud, "That is a waste mine, gentlemen, there can be no more than stone and mud." Something worthwhile, no matter what the purpose of Mr. Doolin, at least I earned, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people around him have expressed their thoughts Look, it looks like the West Mine is not disgusted with Du Lin’s purchase of waste mines? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, they are not clear. When Mr. Hendry reported this incident, the West Mine immediately organized two exploration teams in Mr. Hendry. Repeated exploration in the No. 3 mine was no less than fifteen times, ensuring that no new veins could appear on the land. This agreed with Hendry’s request and even offered the transaction from the West Mine. The official trading channel is carried out. Of course, Du Lin needs to pay another 7 percent of the fee as a commission for the West Mine to host the transaction. This is the rule of the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who pays, who pays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the committee’s executive committee, they also discussed this matter. Most people’s moods are stable and calm, and they are willing to buy waste mines. The purpose, they don't want to know, they just want to watch Du Lin eat a loss, which will let Du Lin know that this is the west, his set of codes of conduct outside, can't play in the west. As for Du Lin’s purchase, he found that he was cheated and wouldn’t make any trouble. The West Mine wouldn’t worry too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, here is the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Monday morning, Du Lin signed a contract with Mr. Hengdeli under the witness of three executive members of the Western Mining Association. The third mine became completely In the industry of Doolin, Du Lin paid 1.18 million for this and bought all the property and slaves in the entire mining area, excluding the mine protection team. After the two exchanged the signed contract, the matter was confirmed. Du Lin declined Mr. Hendry and the executive of the Western Mining Association and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When sitting in the car, Buddha is still asking Du Lin, why spend more than one million to buy a production mine, Du Lin Just smiled, because some things even explained to the Buddha, he may not "understand." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Du Lin suddenly changed from a wicked person to a big gold lord who loved everyone. In just ten days, he took seven mining areas in one breath and became one of the few people with the most property rights in the western part of the mining area. People are praising Mr. Du Lin's vision, his sense of smell and his investment. But in the back, Du Lin has already equated with the idiot. The mines he purchased are basically waste mines. Even if several of them are still being produced, the forecast time for the production of new production reports is also Within one year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squandered a lot of money to solve the worries of the seven mine owners, and even some people took the initiative to run to the door to sell their own veins, but it looks like Du Lin’s funds Already used, he no longer buys minerals everywhere, but quietly calms down to run those industries, hoping that he will not hate his wrong investment after a while. Of course, this is enough for him to take an important life course, not all investments can bring huge returns. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people in the west discuss the attack and Doolin buys minerals everywhere, on the Science Island off the coast of Irian, one can say It was the product of the inter-era, and even Du Lin, who was called "Fat Wild Duck" by the Westerners, personally rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, there are a lot of western-specific ducks in the west near some water sources. These ducks fly, but they are not migratory birds. The fat that will be eaten every winter before coming, then make a hole near the water source, and use the geothermal heat and water temperature to pass the winter. In the fall, the wild ducks will be very fat for hibernation, so fat that they can't fly, even humans can catch them as soon as they run faster. People call this duck "stupid". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lab, Stan’s faintly dressed in a gray anti-static suit stood next to a remodeled TV set, he was slightly lifted Chin, look at the light bulb on the ceiling with the inherent arrogance and pride of a researcher. "Mr. Du Lin, please allow me to introduce you to this inter-generational product, the limited signal connection decoder, after our long... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, ok, yes. We have solved The problem of encryption and decoding is to access the decoder through the electronic signal pulse, and then convert the decoded signal into an image signal, which is played through the instrument." Stan Ein nodded to the other colleague, and A scientific researcher wearing a gray anti-static suit was the same for an instrument. Soon Du Lin’s TV set that only flashed snowflake spots suddenly appeared in a picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
