			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animals still know the gangs, and they are in trouble to seek support through roaring. People who are full of wisdom know how to help themselves out of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbulent public opinion will make the Cape family retreat. At this time, some people need to stand up and escort the Cape family. These people who have been drawn into the water, It is the goal of Magus - the friends of the nobility will only have nobles, because the old aristocrats in the north simply look down on other people who are born, and even the southern aristocrats look down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the "Aristocratic Territory" that was still covered in snow in the north, the old Cape family pulled their brothers and sisters together and discussed the matter. Du Lin directly tore the face and put the things that should have been quietly settled into the court, and made it to the bright side of the empire, which really caused great passiveness to the Cape family. Because they have done these things, even if these things are not their authorization, it is the decision made by Soro who does not know where to die, they also need to be responsible for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because everyone is part of the family and is an inseparable whole, they need to clean up the mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gentlemen, ladies, I think we should talk about how we solve this problem!", Mr. Old Cape coughed a few times, he The body is getting worse and worse, like the nobles of his generation, the age of the retirement is basically the same, the youngest is more than fifty or sixty years old, the older one has been lying in the colder land to the north, forever Accompanied by their emperors of all ages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor told him that he must be completely out of the complicated family affairs before the summer arrives, otherwise he may not be 75 years old. This is too cruel for an old man who is seventy-three years old. He shouldn't know how long he can live. At least he will be a happy day every day, because there is still tomorrow to look forward to. So he did intend to step down as soon as possible, but did not expect that such a thing happened, the mess left by Soro directly affected the power of Polly and his brothers to compete for the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can’t say that Polly has lost this. This is unfair to Polly, unfair to his brother, and will leave a huge family. Hidden dangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heirs who are not convinced of oral success will definitely look for a chance to fight again, regardless of winning or losing, the strength of the family will be greatly weakened. So old Cape needs to put this matter on the Presbyterian Church inside the family to discuss how to face it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is leaning the family resources to help Polly fight back to a fair environment, or to give Polly a task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Cape’s younger brother, who is also the loser of the heirs, sits on the left side of Mr. Old Cape. He looks more old, and the brown age spots on his face are connected. The loser always makes himself difficult when he is quiet and lonely. It is normal for him to age more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the brothers and sisters sitting around the round table and coughed. "The glory of the family is not tolerable. This is our grandfather at our adulthood." I have always kept in mind today. If there is no Cape family, there will be no seats here." The old man buckled the chest emblem with a finger like a dry branch and slammed it on the table. Above, "This is us, that is all of us, I will not tolerate anyone to let it be tainted by the dust!" He turned to Mr. Old Cape, "Homeowner, this is my attitude!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s words have a great resonance in this room. The older the person is, the more stubborn it is. It’s really because these people are stubborn people in their lifetime. ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stubbornness of the old people is their insistence on one's most loved and precious things for an era! It is not stubborn, it is an era that left them with traces of their unwillingness to erase! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years of change have brought too much new things to the world, and they have cherished the past they have. Many old people nod their heads, or they whispered, and finally everyone reached an agreement on the preliminary opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First fight with Doolin... Well, the more the family needs to compromise, the more it is. The world is so helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think that there is nothing in the world that can break through the clouds. When you stand on top of the clouds, there will be a great power to remind you. There is something called gravitation that is binding your strength. Even if you fly into the universe, it is still locked in a box called the universe. So compromise is very necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Solo's grandson dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's still in the dungeon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news of the Cape family formed a lawyer group was spread, as if the most anticipated movie of the year was officially started, in this cold The imperial capital of the city, ushered in a "tour season" before the spring. Many rich people, lawyers, prosecutors and people from all walks of life came to the Imperial Capital. They wanted to get to know and participate in the trial of this case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that on the day the number of seats is confirmed, the number of the auditing seats will be collected. In some places, one seat has been fired to a high price of one hundred. The people who are hurting the eggs are crazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of this incident is absolutely explosive. Even the federal side has come to many media stations in the capital, to get first-hand anytime, anywhere. Information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Du Lin, who is far away from the west, must not be harassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at the intensive reporter outside the window, loosened the deformed blinds he had pulled, and sat back on the sofa. Sitting in the opposite part of the Workers' Union, the president of the Workers’ Union, smiled, because he could not meet Du Lin’s request, and Du Lin was the first to know that in addition to the city of Otis, there was no place for workers’ unions to penetrate. --west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s initial plan was to get enough workers through the resume registration system already implemented by the workers’ union. The resume registration system of the workers' union is a new information management method that is extended by the city's citizenship file system. They record every worker's information registered in the workers' union, no longer. Just like before, just a name plus a contact and salary requirement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What these workers will do, what kind of technology they have, what they are not willing to do, what causes them to leave their last job and hope to get a copy next time What kind of work is recorded inside, it is convenient to use the workers to select workers. After the implementation of this set of information methods, the working class and capitalists were greatly supported. After all, both parties were very satisfied with this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers found the job they wanted, and they also had the rewards they wanted. The capitalists also got a lot of skilled workers, so that their business soon entered. On the right track. If they did not take into account some of the gaps between Doolin and the workers' union, they all wanted to rank Du Lin as an honorary member of the Workers' Union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here, Du Lin actually couldn't find the workers he wanted. It can be said that the workers' union here is just a facade, a fig leaf that can't help in the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the explanation of the president of the branch, Du Lin gradually came to understand that these simple local people in the west are very "hosted", that is, the kind of metal fragments that can be sprayed The "master" of a dead lion. Therefore, the work of the workers’ union here is not going well. The problem of irreconciliation easily attracts the opposition of some registered workers. In order to avoid creating more troubles, the workers’ union here has basically stopped the formal work. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guild internally sent those who were not to be seen to the west, let them raise their own funds here, just like the previous Otis That way, even worse than the previous Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way, Mr. President, I will pay for the activities as an activity fund. You will go for my activities. I have to find one in every city in the west. There will be no less than 50,000 working groups. I will gradually roll out the green industry in the west in this year. This will create a lot of jobs and labor shortages. You will solve this for me. I will pay for your commission. "During the thoughts in Du Lin's mind, "a person is very rich, one year!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the club are almost finished after listening, two Twelve cities, each with 50,000 people, this is more than one million people. A person is pumping a lot, this is more than 100,000! With this money, who is still stepping on the horse here as the president? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately slaps his chest and promises. "Don't worry, Mr. Doolin, the workers' union will always be your most loyal friend!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said with a smile, "The word loyalty should not be used between friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent away the club president Then Du Lin’s mind could not help but emerge a person, that is, the monk Kevin. Kevin talked to him for a while before he left the city of Otis, about where he was going. At that time, Kevin asked a question that made Du Lin difficult to answer. He asked Du Lin: Why do you have the most Guars in your hands, and no one else, because you have racial discrimination, refuse these people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Du Lin smiled and did not immediately answer his question. Then Kevin said that Du Lin suddenly realized that he might have gone the wrong way, but now It’s still time to come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
