			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether the Navy will choose to reconcile with the Ministry of Defense in the future, Thomas’s power and status will increase, and the benefits to Doolin will increase. The more someone else wants to deal with him, the more he has to consider the chain reaction that may occur after him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas was a little excited when Du Lin’s sentence was awkward. He nodded hard. “I know what I should do, it’s not for myself, but also for You, my friend!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, that's it." Du Lin took the plate from the Buddha, and there were eight-petal apples on the plate. The cuts seem to be neat and tidy, compared to another polygon apple that is suddenly covered with a layer of post-modern abstract art. From the visual point of view, it adds more appetite. Du Lin took a piece, Thomas took a piece, he put the plate on the bed. "Next, I will talk about some things that I need you to help. In fact, you don't have to be nervous, there is no fight." The killing is purely driving around the car."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need for a pass to enter and exit the city in military control, but the problem is that this pass is not necessarily Can do it. He was first listed as a suspect, and the Western Military Region could not give him the pass to let him leave freely. He is likely to leave or return in the near future. He needs to have such a pass, otherwise many things may come out. problem. In the eyes of Dooling, Thomas is now the pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that he has pulled the doorman down, he is still thinking about how to involve these things to more people, who knows that the doorman is actively jumping It’s down. Although he did not say anything to the two soldiers just now, it was enough to make the doorman burnt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matthew is dead, yes, and Doolin knows who is the hand. He glanced at the apple, and the murderer used him to kill Matthew's hands and cut the apple for himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Killing Matthew is not the result of Du Lin’s deliberate choice, or whoever goes to talk to Mennon about him, then the person who goes will To die, this is the life that the Mennon himself has taken. Through some small means, Du Lin has already entered the Mennon Pit. It is not necessarily true that the investigators of the Western Military Region have determined that the people are killed by the Mennon, but it is still possible for them to harass the Mennon for a period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, Doolin needs to solve two problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question, the name of the Freedom Front, launched a public opinion to detonate the huge bomb in the West, and let the entire empire know that after the empire entered the new era more than two decades later, there are still slaves and slave owners in the western part of the empire. Such relations and classes, as well as many civilians from other countries, became slaves in the west and lived a miserable life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the imperial people who have just emerged from the era of decaying royal rule, they have not forgotten the pain exerted on them by the empire in the past, active or forced to become slaves of the nobility. Everything that they have is aristocratic. The nobility has all the powers of the slaves, including the power to take away their lives at will. And those slave owners, who are more cruel and bloody to slaves, use fear to control these slaves, all of which have not yet gone out of people’s memory, and remain in the depths of people’s memories, and Doolin wants to wake them up. memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without the intervention of the Western Military Region, it may take some days for Du Lin to pull out the big bomb, but now he must do it in advance. In case the people of the Freedom Front were killed by the military, his next plan would be finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second question, split off the West Mine, this is the cooperation between him and Hengdeli, want to break the current West Mine will be west The dominance of the mining industry will make the West Mine fall from the high clouds, let people see the ugliness and evil of the West Mine, and how much "profit" they have taken from the hands of the mine owners. In fact, the front is to say to people outside the West. Those who do not live in the West will involuntarily stand on the commanding heights of morality to condemn others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only these mine owners and mining companies living in the west will consider the most realistic issue - the interests, and make a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After solving these two problems, the west will be flat, and many of Doolin’s plans can be promoted in an orderly manner. As for the doorman... In fact, the doorman was not put in the mind by Du Lin. It was destined to be a loser. His short-sighted eyes were not enough to support him to a higher position. Du Lin was already digging him. The foundation has been around for a long time, but he has not felt it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s “Organic Vegetables” program builds farms in the western enclosures and then cultivates them in a way that people are fools. Many people think that Doolin has problems with his brain. But who can think that when one-third or even one-half of the people in the west have become employees of Doolin, these people in the west are listening to the doormen, or listening to him. Doolin's words? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they have a hard time choosing one of the two people to rely on, Du Lin will give them the opportunity to make a decision because he has a plan to establish the first insurance company in the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is an insurance company, not a local policy that is implemented in an official manner, and there is a very big difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is going to do commercial insurance, and will sign a very thick agreement with each policyholder, and list a lot of them. The terms of the insurance payment are required. Regardless of whether the final insurance company has paid the terms, the impact on the western overall will not be great, because this is a commercial behavior, at most people will curse insurance companies a few words, or curse their insurance brokers, then silently Accept the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the doorman is doomed to fail is not to say that his three-guarantee policy is not good, and he is not completely whimsical. He just mistakenly used political behavior instead of commercial behavior to promote the three-guarantee policy. The reason why the policy is policy is that the government endorses these policies when the policy is born. There is no accident, no disputes, one is one. Second, there is no room for remorse or negotiation. Any act that violates the original content of the policy can be seen as a failure of the policy and an official shamelessness, and the influence may spread to the entire empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a business act, it is a political scandal and a political scandal that officially defrauds civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the doorman is destined to fail, even if he stays for a year, it will not last for two or three years, unless he can insist on pushing himself from beginning to end. The policy, to achieve 100% compensation, then he can not insist on how long, because he will go bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the doorman also did a good thing, because under his impetus, the western people have accepted the special service of "insurance", now the insurance From policy to business services, there are enough basics. To speak, Du Lin should also thank the door farmers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s message is fed back to the command post and the commander’s commander is also a look of pain. The commander is just a lieutenant colonel, even if he wants To resist the fact that Thomas can't do it, the two are far too far. Then the news was fed back to the Western Military Region. The generals stationed in the military area gave a non-command opinion after a slap in the face. As long as they did not mess up, they would go with them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was temporarily relieved, but the door peasant fell deeper and deeper, because Du Lin could stay out of it, and his part of the problem became a problem for the peasant. The question now is whether the peasant has the motivation to kill Matthew. ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still plenty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Dulin’s testimony to the military lies! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military investigated a phone call before Matthew died. The other contact was Du Lin, and the two officers also got testimony from Doolin. Doolin’s testimony was that Matthew called him at night to ask about the private settlement of the differences between the West Mine and Du Lin. Du Lin said that he had not said such things with Matthew, and even did not consider how to solve this. The matter, of course, must be solved through legal means. After all, the empire is a country ruled by law with a sound legal structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin then asked Matthew where he got the news. Matthew said that he was from the Mennon, and Du Lin said that he did not have a Mennon. After talking about these things, the two men hang up the phone after saying a few words. Then Du Lin claimed that he then called the mayor's office and the phone was connected. The records and information obtained from the telegraph office also indicated that there was a phone call from the hospital's senior ward to the city hall at night. And this call is also connected. The talk time lasted about two minutes. Du Lin told Mennon about Matthew's call to him, asking why the farmer used his name to incite conflicts of opposition, and then the doorman did not say anything to hang up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here the officer specifically stressed the question, he asked Du Lin whether he could confirm that the person answering the phone was a doorman, and Du Lin’s answer was uncertain. Because the sound in the telephone receiver has a certain degree of distortion, and secondly he did not call the doorman, so he is not sure if the other party is a doorman. But Doolin added that someone who can answer his phone in the mayor's office, if not a doorman, is also a person who has a relationship with Mennon and is very close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about seven minutes, Matthew was assassinated at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the testimony of both Du Lin and Mennon, the military reached a conclusion that the doormen might arbitrarily provoke the opposition between Du Lin and the West Mine. However, Matthew did not settle down and contacted Du Lin, so that both sides found out that this is actually a doorman. Then Du Lin called to the doorman to verify, in order to avoid more uncontrollable possibilities, he sent someone to kill Matthew. This is also in line with Matthew's performance when he left the City Hall twice. It must have been a very excessive lie of the doorman's fabrication, which made Matthew and the West Mine feel unbearable, so that Matthew would contact Du Lin privately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
