			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to know that the agreement we signed is not counted!", Mr. Sail ordered a cigarette, and his private doctor had already asked him to ban Things like tobacco and alcohol, including all the things you can enjoy, are not allowed to be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is afraid of death, but before the death has come, even if you understand some profound truth, you can't stop people from flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus was silent for a while before he said, "That was a lot of years ago, and the agreement is only valid for fifteen years."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not something I am thinking about, Magus, now I need it, I have to do something to save the current situation. I helped you at the beginning, now you should Help me.” Mr. Sail’s tone is very firm. “If I fail, I will expose all the insides, the moment before I die. You can talk to them, then you discuss, I wait. Your reply!", waiting for Magus to answer, Mr. Sail hangs up the phone. There was no reluctance on his face, and there was a little smugness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the songs that were popular more than 20 years ago and walked to the window, looking at the spring of recovery outside the window, the tender green star point made the whole world Become a business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war twenty years ago was not just an ordinary war. In the view of many high-rise towers and even top-level people, the federal state-owned people chose to use the method of exporting war to temporarily solve some troubles in order to solve the increasingly fierce conflicts and contradictions in the social class, and then broke out the most famous north and south of the northern continent. The war, the federal invasion of the empire, a week of the empire's southern borders fell completely, and even the resistance could not be done. A large number of recruited soldiers died in the battlefield of the southern meat grinder. There are some battlefields today, and some dark red soils can be seen. It is said that these were dyed by the blood at that time and have not faded so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war has had a profound impact on both countries. The Federation has solved the internal contradictions by exporting wars, and the Empire has lost millions. Even more fighters later recovered all the territories conquered by the federation, and with this as an opportunity, Magus led the new party to a strong position, ended the feudal rule of the Yaoxing Empire for thousands of years, completed a new life, and entered a new era. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are not clear, in fact, before the outbreak of the Civil War, Mr. Sail, the founding father of the federal state, met with the young New Party leader Magus, and they were quietly Mimi signed a series of 15-year agreements. The agreement is full of too many terrible things, it can never be exposed, and this agreement has become a sword in the hands of Mr. Sail, used to force Magus to agree to his conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His condition is actually very simple... let the empire launch a war, just like it was twenty years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several independent cities led by the city hall of Saint-Louis City to launch an independent referendum. Mr. Sail knew that this is definitely not Saint-Louis really wants independence. As a federal heart city, even if the referendum is passed, they are really independent, but can they dare to announce this result? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t dare, just block all communication and trade, they can trap these cities and return them to the arms of the Federation. This is the last fatal blow of these consortia. They want Mr. Sail, the federal government, and the citizens of the whole federation to know their determination. They need to start negotiations and sit at the negotiating table to solve the current problems. However, Mr. Sail is not willing to do this. There is no doubt that he is very clear about the ideas of these consortia. They are trying to avoid being killed and then waiting for the opportunity to re-emerge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stupid joint parliament has already done it once and again, and the concessions have made these consortia grow stronger, if you use the power directly from the beginning These people are completely evaporated, so there will be no troubles afterwards. Decentralization, separatism, all this is because of the first time without determination and the last step of the realization. Now, after so many years of dog-like battles, Mr. Sail has to calm down these people before they die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will not open the negotiation process, he will watch Saint-Louis enter the referendum, and even expect them to declare the referendum through independence. If you don't push yourself to a desperate situation, the others will not have the courage to put the knife in your hand into your body, and then kill the person standing behind you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temporary regime has now weakened the strength of these consortiums to the utmost extent, but there is still something wrong with wanting to completely destroy them. It can be said that it is the recognition of the whole people, and it can be said that it is the indifference of the whole people. Mr. Sail does not want to compromise with these people, so he needs some help from external forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is more powerful than the war of aggression to unite the Union. At that time, those who are independent in the interior and engaged in division will become All federal sinners do not even need any means, they will go to extinction. As for everything that has been sacrificed for this, it is worthwhile. For this country to move toward true unity, it is forgiven for us to give up some people’s interests and even life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Mr. Sail will not say that this is to build the national family, mainly because his family can continue for a long time and hold power. No one knows this country better than him, and only he and other nationals can make this country go further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Empire, Magus walked through the streets into an underground space, dim lighting can only illuminate the ground, in a dark room , a conference table, matt's desktop did not reflect any light. There are some high-back chairs around the conference table, and the chairs are full of people. I can't see their appearance here, it's dark, only to see a vague outline. When Magus enters the room, the "young man" sitting in the first place is ridiculed with a young voice. "Every time You are the latest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus smiled. He sat in his chair and looked at the shadows around him. Everyone arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This room is very wonderfully designed. It is said that the great figures of the Imperial Academy Art Branch participated in the design. The theme drawings are said to come from the collection of religions in the theocracy era. The light became controllable in this room, and everyone only showed the lower body, but the wonderful appearance of the other people could not see a dark outline. As for what kind of means was used to build this room, Magus didn't know, but he was curious but didn't want to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man sitting in the first position is leaning his legs, and some rusty copper rings on his hands look more serious than the last rust, at this time he In the hands of the hand is playing a gold coin, which is the most commonly used currency of the Empire during the feudal rule, the Yaoxing Empire gold coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Magus overthrew the feudal dynasty, almost all the imperial gold coins were cast into gold bricks in the treasury, and some were given to the imperial central bank in exchange for those businessmen. Some of their support is used as a "margin" for early issuance of currency. It is rare to see such gold coins on the market, each one is very expensive. Its current price has exceeded its price as a currency, and it can be regarded as a young antique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus took off his hat and placed it on the table in front of him. He loosened his scarf and coughed twice. "Gentlemen, I started today." This meeting is that Mr. Sail hopes that we can fulfill the seventeen agreements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The agreement has expired.", speaking is sitting in Magus The shadow opposite, this person is wearing a dark gray white striped trousers, a little stylish, but the sound is a bit old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
