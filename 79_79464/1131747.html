			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just got rid of Mr. Knight and the disabled child Henry, they met six major production companies, by the way, starting this year, "mental retardation "It will also be a standard for the review of imperial disabled people. This will undoubtedly benefit many provincial sages. After all, the words of the provincial sages are not inconspicuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only dirty, lazy, stupid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six major companies have always wanted to talk to Du Lin after talking about the cooperation with the TV station. This is also the cooperation that the six major film companies attach great importance to. And a chance to turn over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once it can be proved that the benefits of TV on demand are not weaker than the box office of the cinema, it is very likely to have a very strong impact on the future film industry. The right to speak and the initiative will return to the producers from the hands of the cinema, and they can ask for more "reasonable" demands to protect their own interests, rather than knowing that the theater has been stealing At the box office, they are unable to do anything in violation of the contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits involved in this year are more than 10 million yuan, and these companies are not allowed to do so. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the entertainment market of the empire is getting bigger and bigger, the evaluation agency of Xie Lisi Street believes that within five years, the entertainment industry of the entire empire, especially the size of the film industry will reach More than two billion yuan. In the past, a film of 300,000 can be called a big production, but a few years later, a film of one million is eligible to say that it is a big production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presidents of the six major production companies have looked at Henry, who is talking to his girlfriend in the near future. Henry seems to have noticed the gaze here. Lifted the glass in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See no, that is the president of the six major production companies, our relationship is very good, so your movie will not have any problems at all, rest assured "Henry once again stroked some worried little girlfriends," and I also pulled Du Lin, he is my good friend, will not let me suffer!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry didn't know why the presidents of the six major production companies would look at him together. In fact, even if he knew it, he might not be angry because it was a fact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has just invested a million in one of the six major production companies, entrusting the other party to include everything including scripts, directors, and actors. He is only responsible for providing money and the heroine, and requests that it be released at the latest next year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before contacting Henry, the six major studios did not realize that the money was so good, which indirectly promoted the recent events in the film industry. New noun - packaged service. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the agents waving their project books brought a lot of money from the nouveau riche, and made the film circle at the end of the year very lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growing market means more and more benefits, the previous six major studios have to surrender to the theater side, putting nearly half or even more More money is handed over. They have also considered running their own theaters, but this investment is definitely not something that can be played by themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire empire has so far included more than 1,100 new cinemas, double the number three years ago, which also reflects the economy of the empire. After the take-off, more bonuses were released to every imperial citizen, so that they could spend money to enjoy the spiritual needs after eating and drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the six major companies want to join forces to suppress these theaters, they must build another 1,100 theaters and continue to build more theaters, at least In more than 3,000, it is possible to fully occupy the market and expel other theaters. But the problem is that they can't afford so much money, can't afford the construction and follow-up maintenance of so many theaters, they can only be controlled by the theater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Du Lin’s on-demand can effectively solve these problems, they can use the TV station’s on-demand to expand their income, and then go step by step. The line market, which is related to their income problems for many years to come, must be on the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Doolin, I don’t know when the cable group in the TV group can be spread all over the city?", the president of the Blue Bay Film Company asked everyone Both are very concerned about the issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most criticized place of TV stations is that they are laying too slow. So far, only the lines of major first-tier cities and some second-tier cities have been completed. As for other Basically, it is only in the plan on paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin considered this question and then replied, "It may take a year or two, we have accelerated the speed of laying, but I hope you can understand that some cities obviously have some inexplicable resistance to some new things. Not all cities welcome such new things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several presidents looked at the president of Blue Bay Studios after a glance On the body, the 40-year-old gentleman smiled on the surface, but his heart was groaning. He smiled slightly, and Zhang waited for a few seconds before he spoke. "We have an idea..." He said that he stopped here. After watching Du Lin’s expression closely, Du Lin nodded and gestured to him. He continued. “You know that the people we make movies can meet people in many different places. Maybe we can help in this matter. Busy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is more fluent and his ideas are clearer. "We can help the TV group to lay the lines of the city below, then change hands. Renting to the TV Group, the cost of laying and maintaining the line itself is borne by us..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words have not been fully finished, Doolin interrupted with apology His words, "Sorry, the TV Group's business is not my own responsibility. You can contact Ms. Nasha and Ms. Freina for these things. They should be interested in this." In fact, it is obvious that it is rejected. However, there are many kinds of refusals. At least such refusal will not make people lose face and maintain each other's decent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can understand that professional things are the most correct choice for professional people to do.", Blue Bay president nodded, although failed. They don't feel bad either. This is to try it out. What if it succeeds? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people talked about the development and performance of Kinsale in the film and television circle this year. Du Lin talked with them for a while and changed another place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the engagement ceremony began, Du Lin would go back and forth in one small circle, and those who said something unrelated to this engagement ceremony might involve business. Even things about people's livelihood are things related to money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Magus saved him in time, and the royal family came. As one of the protagonists in the engagement ceremony, Doolin must be with Magus. Go and meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the royal family has become a symbol, a mascot, the royal family is at least the royal family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I didn’t expect was that Du Lin, who came from the royal family, knew that the book he was going to send on the princess’s birthday was a young man with an egg book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal lady’s birthday with an egg book as a birthday present, but also discovered by the princess’s brother, the other party can keep the instrument is very educated Performance, of course, this also let Du Lin know the young man who talked with him, His Royal Highness the Three Emperors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are seven children, five men and two women today. If the financial problems of the royal family are becoming more serious, the old emperor who may have lost power will always be a man. Until the palace is full. Even if this is the case, the emperor, who had only two children thirty years ago, added five immediate members to the royal family after losing power. In the days of power, the only thing that can kill time is to fight in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Doolin, we met again..." After the three emperors and Du Lin shook hands, they glanced at Magus. "Last time I After the sister’s birthday party, she also asked about your contact information. In fact, I personally think that perhaps choosing the royal family is the most correct choice!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the words, the three emperors smiled slightly toward Magus. "I am very sorry, first of all, I don't mean anything to disparage the Mamont family. I just stated a fact from the position of a brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin faintly felt that the three emperors and Magus had a somewhat inexplicable smell of gunpowder, and he thought it was normal. Magus forced the emperor to lose his power. It was not only the emperor who took the loss, but the entire royal family suffered huge losses, and their descendants, descendants of future generations, continued infinitely backward, all People suffer huge losses because of Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inheritance of the throne is not representative of the change of power, which is really painful for the royal family members, and he does have reasons to be hostile to Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The royal family is honored, and the age of His Royal Highness is too small. I believe that there will be more suitable for the princess in her life.", Du Lin added a sentence, the three emperors like to provoke Magus, but if you pull yourself into it, it is not worthwhile, he is very timely "opening", and then let people invite the three emperors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
