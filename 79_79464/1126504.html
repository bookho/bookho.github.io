			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at the door of the villa, and he shook his shoulders to make the clothes more comfortable. After spitting a cigarette, I put the cigarette in my mouth and took a roll of money from my pocket. I dropped a few pieces on the floor and said in a slightly vague voice, "I have to stay here overnight, I don't want to When I saw you, I took the money to buy some wine and then found some skilled women. Don’t let me see you again, understand?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread Money is a denomination of twenty denominations. Although it is a zero banknote, it is already a great denomination for most ordinary people. Many people have two pieces of money in their pockets, at most five denominations, and a coin. Who can, and who can carry a roll of twenty denominations in their pockets? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gust of cool wind blew, blowing away the heat of the day, but the wind blew on Walt's face, but let him burn in anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fully understands what Du Lin is saying, the bastard actually said this, and the last sensibility was also blown away by the wind mixed with banknotes. After copying his fist, he called Du Lin. "You bastard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin leaned back and shunned the punch, but he did not counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a high-end community. Although there is no strict access control system, the property is very good for the owners and the response is very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About thirty seconds, Dooling "missed" was hit by a punch, but when Walter wanted to continue the attack, suddenly back There was a sharp pain in the last time, and it was so painful that he could not continue to stand, fell to the side of the road, twisted and twitched, and his face became blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Doolin, we need to check your physical condition...", then the doctors stationed in the community looked extremely nervous at Du Lin, when they When the "Enthusiastic Neighbors" alarm was received, it was said that when someone attacked Doolin, the entire security team ran like crazy. Others may not know how powerful Du Lin is, but those who have worked in the gray industry themselves are very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd, awesome, the well-deserved underground emperor of Nano Lindes, who is also the mayor, ruled Nano Lindes for more than 20 years, each line The industry is under his control. On the surface he controls the nano Lindes in the sun. In the dark he has an underground world that rules Nano Lindes. No one dares to violate his orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what about such a powerful person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he secretly created the chips circulating in Otis, Du Lin discovered that the entire interest group was uprooted overnight. The official saying is that some of the officials, including the mayor, were urgently transferred to other cities to take office, but those in the gray industry understand that those people are finished, and one night in the nano-Lindes for twenty years. The great forces of the combination of righteousness and evilness are uprooted overnight, one does not stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin is having something here..., they will be numb when they think of the scalp here, they must not live, whether it is Du Lin or Du Lin That group of people will have their lives, they can only hope that Du Lin can be beaten enough, don't worry about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, it seems that Du Lin is not a big problem. Only when they arrived at the scene did they punch a fist, and the attackers did not use guns or daggers. This is the only good news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several security fierce look at Walter who is scratching his back on the ground, can’t wait to take the bastard away and find a place where no one is directly buried. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin waved his hand and put together his clothes. He had a friendly and tolerant smile on his face, and looked at Walter lying on the ground. I licked my lips. "I was attacked by this person. I am bothered to help you to call me. Such a villain has given him the results he deserves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No trouble "No trouble!", the security captain and the property manager both panted from the distance. After the phone was connected, the security captain arranged for the security guard to protect Du Lin and found the manager of the property. In fact, in the city of Otis and even most cities, most of the companies and companies that have a relationship with property and property have been engaged in some black or gray industries, which has almost become an unspoken rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in some very high-end residential properties - also known as service companies - are all of these phenomena, and the problems of personnel are more serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service for power is never a slogan. Sometimes when a property owner needs to deal with some less serious dirty work, these properties can play a certain degree. effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and shook hands with the security captain and the manager, thanking them for their protective attitude towards the owners, then turned and left. Although he left, these security guards will not let Walter who created a great "surprise" for them. At least before the police came, Walter would enjoy it very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will not stop here, and Du Lin will have to bring Walter to court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general assault crime can be light and heavy. If there is no serious consequence, no huge economic loss, the understanding of the attacked person, court Release is possible. But if you sue him to death, three or five years or more may not be possible. When Walter enters the prison, he will understand how sweet the free air is, but he may never be able to fill his lungs with sweet air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin returned to the villa, Natiya immediately greeted her. She saw the whole passage behind the window. At this time, the only thing she cares about is Du. Is Lin injured? As for Walt, she didn’t realize that she didn’t care so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are hurt!", Natiyah supported Du Lin, gnashing her teeth. "I saw that the bastard hit you." She is like It was to treat Du Lin as hard as a patient, which made Du Lin laugh and laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Walt’s guy who has not experienced life-and-death battles, why can he hurt him? This is just for witnesses’ testimony to Walter’s sentencing. It is helpful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was helped to sit on the sofa, and Natiya took off his coat without saying anything, but wanted to see where he was beaten. Not being wrapped up, Du Lin took off his shirt and revealed his strong body. Although there are no particularly obvious edges and lines, it can be very strong. He always has sports. In order to ensure his health and body shape, people will not like a sick official. They prefer those enthusiastic and energetic officials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the left rib of Doolin, there is some redness, not serious. Even if Du Lin is playing, it can't be really a bit of a fight by an angry person, at least for a while, and some redness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya suddenly panicked, and there was no preparation for the contusion in the medical bag at home. She picked up the phone and called Melissa, who is in the girlfriend’s house. A phone call, let her come back immediately, and by the way, buy some medicine for bruises from the pharmacy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He won’t harass you again in the future." Du Lin kept holding Natiya and didn’t know where to put it and looked at her. I will let him disappear for a while. If he eats the food in the prison, it might be a good place. At least some people will understand that they should be in awe of the world. If you don’t want to, of course, I can Forgive him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natiya was a bit shy, and her hand was pressed by Du Lin. I could hear these words. The woman’s anxious face was a little bit annoying and fleeting. "He hurts you, he should go to jail." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Melissa came back in a hurry, her girlfriend’s home was not far from here, and the girl rushed into the house with a woven bag from the pharmacy. I saw Du Lin’s red fruit sitting on the sofa, and for a moment she forgot what she wanted to say. Her attention was concentrated on Du Lin’s body, and her face gradually became a bit red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, she came back, "Mom, what happened?", she was sitting a little uneasy next to Natiya, with a spray in her hand. The bag of the agent was placed on the coffee table. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natiya asked Du Lin to spray the potion while talking about what happened just now, which made Melissa very angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt’s betrayal of the family seriously hurts his father’s image in this girl’s mind, as Melissa said to Walter before, In this family, Natiya has always been silently paying, Walter does nothing, but also betrays the family, hurts them, even in front of her face and the woman fooling around. The hatred of the man in her heart even made her ignore the relationship between the father and the daughter and has evolved into a more extreme emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps she has also respected Walter very much, but in Walt’s years of leisure and deception, she has her prestige, status and affection. The consumption is dry and only leaves hatred and disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sitting for a while and hearing about Walter’s ending, Melissa quickly left the living room and returned to the room. She was somewhat uncomfortable with the atmosphere. Always give her a feeling of not being able to come up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The departure of her daughter gave Natiya a sigh of relief. Now that things are done, it seems awkward. She doesn’t know what to do to disperse. This inexplicable embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a minute or two of silence, Du Lin suddenly said, "I want to apologize for what you have just done outside, something you don't know." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? What?", Natiya suddenly returned to the spirit, she looked at Du Lin and looked at other places, "No. No need to apologize, you have done so much for us, you should thank and apologize that I am right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
