			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many literary and artistic works, especially film and television works, there are always some pictures that are familiar to each other. Most of these pictures are the main character who cuts a piece of raw beef into his mouth with a dagger, or starts to take the warhead without any auxiliary measures. It also includes cutting off the meat that may rot on his body, or poisonous meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the purpose of these lens bridges is to tell the audience that in the movie you are currently watching, the male lead or the heroine is definitely a steel tough guy, that kind of The role of the knife is unrelenting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naturally, when these characters are used by the enemy, they are becoming more and more hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one cares about the role of the sly character on the screen in order to keep himself alive and cut off his legs and hands to kill the Quartet in real life. How about, will not cry because of a broken knee on the knee, the audience only care about their appearance on the screen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much is Maggs’s tax reform in the new party camp can let people know how determined he is about the tax reform. If someone else makes a knife to let others cooperate, it may bring a rebound soon, but it will be chilling to let others slash and let others cooperate. At least he shows that I don’t even care about my own life. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the personal confirmation of Maggs, the Police General Administration and the National Security Council quickly transferred a group of elite forces to cooperate with the State Administration of Taxation to form The special investigation team based on Nepal began to investigate the seven major casinos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is a lot of material at hand - a photo of Chap himself to entertain guests to participate in cash gambling, Rani believes that it is imperative to control Chap, From him, he dug up the good luck casino and even the seven major casinos may have tax evasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, Chap rushed to the Imperial Capital by car. He didn’t know what happened between this short night. The main purpose of his visit to the emperor was In order to see the top management of the Securities Association, ask if the process of listing the Good Luck Casino can advance speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding, Du Lin has not realized the current situation in the casino and is able to get out as quickly as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He met Mr. Clark at the club on the outskirts of the Imperial City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark is a very common name. There are thousands of Mr. Clarke in the entire empire, but Mr. Clark, whom Chap meets, is not ordinary. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the top executive of the Securities Association. The full name of the Securities Association is the Securities and Financial Management Committee, which has a stock securities management office and an Imperial Financial Research Office. Wait for some offices that are closely related to the financial industry. Originally, Mr. Clark was the highest-ranking person in the Equity Securities Management Office. Later, with the outbreak of the Century Fraud, he himself had a huge opportunity while encountering the most dangerous professional crisis in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Minister of Finance asked Clark to resolve the impact of fraud and fraud as soon as possible, and appointed amp to be responsible for the comprehensive investigation, in the process of Ampu On several occasions, Du Lin’s horses were caught, but they were all very cleverly avoided by Du Lin, and they used unconventional means to create a wide range of demonstrations in the Imperial City, forcing the Ministry of Finance and the Securities Commission to close the case as soon as possible. Before this, Doolin had already released the scapegoat and sent it to the official. The only regret was that the money that was taken away was not recovered. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of detecting hopelessness and public opinion, the Deputy Minister of Finance gave Amp great pressure to tell him to do it or not to do anything. Amp is not willing to give up a lot of evidence in his hands, watching Du Lin completely offended - according to the principles related to imperial law, even if he has sufficient evidence to form an effective evidence chain in the future, Du Lin personally plans and implements In this financial fraud case, he was unable to sue Du Lin and let Du Lin defy the case when the fraud case was closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I can only fight against Doolin from the court, but unfortunately, he eventually lost, lost to Doolin’s old tycoon, and Kevin The dripping water does not leak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 70 million century fraud case basically ends here, but the aftermath is unresolved, and six million people have been recovered from the hands of a nouveau richelor." After the loss "returned some of the investors, more money has been no news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to Mr. Clark's outstanding performance in the Century Fraud case, the Ministry of Finance believes that Mr. Clarke is too proud of the stock securities management office and promoted him to the management of the Securities Commission. As for the other situation behind this, there is another situation. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few years, Mr. Clark is more attractive than ever. He is almost fifty years old, but he is only forty years old and some believe it. When a man reaches this age, it is truly blooming. The energy, experience, knowledge, cultivation and all things are entangled to extract the intoxicating fragrance, which belongs to the fragrance of men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hair is neatly affixed to the scalp, and the expensive clothes on his body also reflect the welfare of the club, the rhinoceros shoes are hidden low-key Luxury, such a man is enough to fascinate many young girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they greeted each other, they changed into a dress in the locker room of the stadium. Then Chap personally drove the turf and drove Clark into the stadium. The two praised the weather, touted each other, and then really started playing like a game. When the game went to the third hole, Chap couldn't help it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Clark, the application I submitted does not know when it will be approved, you know, all of our shareholders are very concerned about this!", Chap stood On Clark's side, the latter's attention was on the batting. He waved a few times and then slammed it out. The ball flew across the air in a beautiful parabola and landed on the green. Chapman I can't help but praise, "Good ball, Mr. Clark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark took off the platform and shook his head. "It can be better, but the wind just suddenly A little smaller, I should wait a second.", he said to go to the turf car, Chap also quickly catch up, the car slowly headed for the third hole of the green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the car, Clark looked at the clouds moving slowly in the sky, whispered, "We have seen your report, but the committee members think that it should be Wait a minute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a minute?", Chap's scalp tightened, the car swayed twice, and he apologized and asked quickly, "Why I have to wait. The process of the General Chamber of Commerce is almost finished, and I think the report is very appropriate and there should be no problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark did not refute, nod Said, "This is indeed the case. The report is very well written, and the data is very detailed. According to the normal situation, the committee should approve it soon..." If the words are not finished, it means there is a turning point. "But, the general manager It will pass too fast, you know, the empire always wants to bring back the power in the hands of the Chamber of Commerce. On some issues... you can understand that there is some opposition in ideology."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are doing it quickly, indicating that you and the Chamber of Commerce will be closer. This has caused some members to be dissatisfied with this, so it will be delayed. And whether the enterprises engaged in special operations can be listed on the market, there are no precedents and standards. In order to avoid accidents, the committee also needs to work with the Ministry of Finance and the General Chamber of Commerce. Communicate over there, and finally, if you can make sure that it is correct, the card will only give you approval and allow you to list it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chap has an egg at this time The sadness of the egg, he did not expect to spend so much money to get through the relationship of the Chamber of Commerce, so that the process of the Chamber of Commerce will speed up, but created the dissatisfaction of the card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that there will be such a result, he must first let the Chamber of Commerce drag over there, and maybe the certificate will go faster. . What is even more troublesome is that Clark’s “no precedent” is also a big trouble. After repeated discussions by the Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Finance, I don’t know that it’s been a few years later. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brain turned very quickly. It took only a few seconds to think of a new rhetoric or maybe. "You just said that there was no The specific case determines whether a company that specializes in doing business can go public, then I have a small problem here..." Clark accepted the benefits of Chap, and he would naturally listen to the words of the God, "so clear The text stipulates that companies engaged in special operations cannot be listed for listing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question really asked Clark, he thought for a moment, shook Shaking his head, "As far as I know, there are no laws or regulations that prohibit companies that specialize in doing business from listing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark’s answer made Chapson In one breath, he pretended to laugh a few times and said, "So why don't we make these precedents?" He was afraid that Mr. Clark did not understand what he meant and quickly explained, "I mean let us To make this precedent, both No regulations do not allow us to market, there is no provision allows us to market, so in this regard is a blank "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
