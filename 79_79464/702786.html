			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When dinner, Mrs. Vivienne stretched her neck and took a bite of whole-grain bread with a thick soup. Her recent appetite was somewhat shallow. A pregnant woman, Vivienne, even found two women of the same age who looked a little more comfortable from the slum to take care of her daily life. Compared to those Guart women who have three or five or more children in their lifetime, she simply does not know how to be a mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in eating habits are one of them. The children of the Guarts died very little in the years after birth. On the contrary, those rich and powerful. They often hear that children have died. In order to protect the child in the belly, Mrs. Vivian, decided to correct and improve according to the eating habits of the Guar people, and try to avoid those foods that are too delicate and delicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that even if the whole wheat bread is soaked with thick soup, it is not so delicious. She only eats a small piece and feels that she has not eaten a second. The desire of the film, glanced at the vegetable salad in the bowl, and suddenly there was a feeling of self-restraint. She has never eaten such a bad food. The previous salad was made of various fine fruits. It has never been filled with leaves and almost invisible sweet sauce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a conflict with your little lover?", Mrs. Vivian picked up her napkin and touched her lips, looking at Peter sitting across from her. "Or do you still find a little girl? Sometimes I think you are my father's child, because your hobbies are almost!", she means that two men like the young girl, of course she I can understand this mood, after all, she did the same thing before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter put down the tea, rubbed the gravy on his mouth, swallowed the food in his mouth, and took a sip of wine to say: "Ernst It’s too deep, he is not only smuggling private wine, but also smuggling grimace mushrooms and anesthetics. Do you know that the anesthetics are always insufficient in the hospitals in our city? The quotas that disappeared are in his hands!”, Peter Picking up the napkin and wiping the mouth, throwing it aside, "The notice in the state has come down. At the latest, the branch of the Teyle City Prohibited Investigation Bureau must be established one week. The main staff are all from other places. I have to make some preparations, at least not to let the outside guests see the dirty things in the home that are not suitable for them to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a topic about Ernst The mayor and Vivian are very clear that they have lost the blessing of the mayor. The first person to solve Ernst is Karur. All of Doolin’s farms and trading companies were destroyed, and there will soon be people from the Dispute Investigation Bureau stationed at the station. He can’t figure out that there is no way to smuggle wine through steam locomotives as before. His business Finished! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After removing Doolin and removing Ernst, the entire smuggling market in the city of Tener will be controlled by Karel alone. More profit is enough to make this old thing crazy. He doesn't have much involvement with the mayor like Ernst. When necessary, he can become a bargaining chip between the old forces and the contraband investigation bureau. Of course, before he had to do so, the mayor would still escort Carrull slightly. Some of the profits he made were part of the old party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you often appear behind Queen Street recently? Is there anything fun there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mrs. Vivian has a little interest. Peter is very interested in finding a topic. Recently, Mrs. Vivian has been working near the slums. She has called for more women to be independent by donating clothes and food to the poor. . During this period of time as a feminist warrior, Mrs. Vivian found a keen sense that a woman who is truly willing to join the feminist movement either has nothing or has a high status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is fighting for the benefit of the future for their own benefit, while the latter is full of fun, there is nothing interesting to do, simply find something Just do it. Therefore, she put the main development scope in the slums. She has to say that she feels very sensitive and very agile. The feminist movement has developed to more than 30 days today, and more than 50 feminist movements have been developed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of them are Ogings, a few provincial sages and a very small number of gults, guart women only account for a total of three. But even if the number is small, Mrs. Vivian is very happy, which means that the women in the city of Tener are finally unwilling to be manipulated by men and bravely stand up. To this end, the capital’s feminist movement sponsors and the General Assembly also sent a congratulatory letter, and stated that at the General Assembly’s meeting, the vote was approved by Mrs. Vivian’s to become the president of the Tener City Feminist Games. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time, Mrs. Vivian was recognized by more people for her own efforts, and she took the first step in her pursuit of ideals. I have never been so full of fighting spirits as I am now, and my emotions are so passionate. I have to read the letter of the General Assembly several times before going to bed every night to be able to sleep peacefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She’s slightly tilted her mouth, nodded and stood up, and smiled when she turned around: “I think the priest is right, only selfless dedication can make people Feel happy to be able to cleanse the dirt in your soul!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor stunned and then laughed loudly. "This is the best joke I have heard this year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles know the church is like The church knows that the nobility has almost nothing to hide and hide from each other. The two sides have fought for hundreds of years and have already seen their opponents. If the ordinary people say that the mayor is absolutely convinced, but as the descendant of the nobles, Mrs. Vivian, she also said that he was funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor smiled very happy, smiled and sighed with relief, and all the ease of the former poured into his body. After more than a month of busyness, the damn tax investigator finally left Turner with a black face, and some of the restless forces in the city were swept away. Although he had to fight with the newly established contraband investigation bureau, he did not have any frustration or discouragement. Instead, he was as full of fighting spirit as Mrs. Vivian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know what it’s like to fight with people, but he knows that the empire has an old proverb—the apple plundered from the enemy’s hands, always better than himself. Kind of delicious! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernst is missing overnight, and Flame has begun to expand outward for the first time in recent years. The newly established Bureau of Contraband Investigations is also Unveiled in such a day. These things seem to have nothing to do with Doolin, he is chatting with Xiuen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a change in the image of the past, a special spirit, he is wearing a smart suit, the wax on his hair makes his hair look like a wig . He sat on the other side of the table, his hands on the table, his mouth shut but could not stop the smile on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you come to laugh at me, then you can laugh a lot." Du Lin ordered a cigarette, and the smoke came from Xiu En. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schoen has waved his hand. "I am not coming to laugh at you. I just want to receive your blessings and congratulations. Do you know? I am now in the Tynel area." The first director of the contraband investigation bureau!", his mouth opened again, he never thought that such a position would fall on him until he put his face in it. In the cold water and ice-cream basin, I realized that everything is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His old boss sent him a letter saying that he was recommended to him as the first director of the Teyle Regional Contraband Investigation Bureau. After receiving the approval, the governor immediately gave Xiun a letter of appointment. He is now the director, and he has great authority in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stunned, then nodded and said: "Congratulations, I also found out that you are not laughing at me, you are coming to hurt me. Don't you know what I am doing?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xuen laughed and said: "Of course I know, and this is what I see for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A plan, the previous plan is completely abolished, and he now has a new and high-success plan. He hopes that Doolin can continue to smuggle private wine, he will give Doolin a green light, and at the same time will suppress Karur as much as possible, completely wiped him out of the Tnel area, so that Doolin becomes the only private wine merchant here. He did this not because he was fallen, nor because he and Du Lin were friends. His real purpose was to make the huge profits that Du Lin had smuggled privately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s plain, it’s money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This money is not what he wants, but the old party is coming, once Terniel’s smuggling industry is shuffled, he wants to continue to come from the underground world. The old parties who sucked blood to the Imperial Hub will have to change their partner. As long as they cooperate with Doolin, they will certainly leave some evidence and flaws. At that time, Du Lin only needs to come up with relevant evidence, and Xiu En has enough confidence to thoroughly clean the official site of the city of Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having such a meritorious service to return to a past position is no longer a difficult task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how Du Lin finally handled it, Xiuen also had a full consideration. He would send his plan to the governor, and the plan will be successful in the future. There will be any loss, of course, some of his illegal income and private liquor can no longer be done. But by that time, he had already saved a lot of money, enough for him to spend most of his life, even if he didn't work, he could spend his life comfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last gift he gave to his only friend in the city of Tener! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this is the plan for Xien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can think about it, it’s not too late to reply to you when you come out from there!", Schon said he was about to stand up, he had finished All the purposes of today. Even if Du Lin doesn't agree, it doesn't matter. With his status today, there will be many people rushing to agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
