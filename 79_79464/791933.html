			<div id="content">Clarke is silent, his elbows support the table and drag the chin with his palm, seemingly boring, flipping with the fingertips of the other hand A copy of the document. Of course, he knows what these documents mean, which means a huge amount of fraud involving the case. The only lucky thing is that neither the stock market nor the imperial central bank has any losses in it. As for other investors, it has nothing to do with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negative attitude made his other supervisory supervisor annoyed. He suppressed the angry emotion and asked: "Did you not hear my opinion?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark put his arms back on the back of the chair, and he looked at Godot, his colleague and supervisor, "I heard it!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why don't you say something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want me to say?" Clarke looked very innocent. "I should attach your opinion to check the stocks of all the shareholders of DreamWorks?", Godot nodded, and Clarke laughed. "You won't buy DreamWorks." Stocks? You have to know that we are not allowed to buy any stocks.", looked at the silent Godo Clarke shook his head, "You are stunned by anger, you really think that the DreamWorks shareholders who operate illegally Will you sit in the conference room and wait for your visit? Then wait for you to handcuff them and put them in jail ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake up, Godot, I bet their shareholders, if they are not fictional, they certainly don’t know where to go. It’s even possible to go abroad! This is a fraud involving tens of millions of stars. They cleverly avoided the quarterly report and then took out a lot of documents to prove that they did have the following assets. Then crazy operation of this stock in exchange for huge profits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To their level of fraud, being caught on the gallows is already the best As a result, they have earned enough money that they will not be able to squander for a few years. How can you wait for you to find them and make up for your losses?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think the most important thing now is how to let those investors calmly accept the fact that the stocks in their hands are worthless. I almost forgot. How do you think you can calmly deal with this?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Godot walked around the office with his own hair and accepted the matter calmly? Impossible, it is impossible to calm down in this life. He put all his savings into it, and he was about to become a new millionaire an hour ago. But after an hour, he became nothing. [br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly he calmed down and took a deep breath. "You said it was good, I should calm down. DreamWorks will stop trading after an hour, but Before this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark shrugged his shoulders. "No member of the stock market is allowed to buy stocks. This is the rule, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand!", Godot immediately ran away from the office. As for the other investors who are dead or alive, he has nothing to do with him. All he wants now is Selling the stock in his hand, so he is still a rich man, at least he has earned three times the profit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark walked over the window and opened the blinds, watching Godo rushing into the car and shaking his head and smiling. Since the stockpile often monitors the financial and operating conditions of some listed companies, it knows a little more about the inside information. In fact, many people are using their positions for profit. This kind of thing can be regarded as a hidden rule. Everyone knows well, but no one can say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because once a person’s business is exposed, it means that everyone who violates the rules may be exposed, and the number of exposures exceeds people’s psychology. At the bottom line, the entire stock market may face the fate of reshuffle. Regardless of whether the supervisor has made a mistake or not, it is a dereliction of duty to let go of the illegal operation of the staff under the opponent or not, so everyone is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Clark knew this thing yesterday. At that time, he happened to handle some things in the office of the Imperial Bank. He considered that he had not found a countermeasure for the whole night. Be able to take one step at a time. The other party has done a good job of accounting. Every income and every expenditure is very beautiful. If it is not a penny in that account, I am afraid that anyone who only looks at the financial statements will think that this is a very promising and promising future. the company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that can be done now is only two things. The movie theater that DreamWorks stated in the report is real estate. Perhaps this information can be used to find clues about fraud. Even identity. The second thing is that the six million funds are transferred, and the six million funded empire central bank will definitely have detailed information. Whenever you go through any account, you will leave enough evidence and clues. Once you have determined what is there. The clue is also an account of the stockholders! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than half an hour, Godot ran back sweating, and the weather in the emperor's September had cooled down, but his shirt collar was sweaty. He took off his jacket and sat on the sofa and gasped. He blinked in his eyes and watched Clark say a thank you. "I recently collected a painting. If you like it, you can borrow it." "The oil painting in Godot's mouth is an antique, and the market value is about 60,000." What he calls "borrowing" is actually a gift in disguise. To know that Clark only needs to make a phone call, he will be finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the other party does not. In this very realistic society he may consider his position, but no matter what purpose he does, at least Godot I made a big profit without losing money. He must know how to be a man in the situation, otherwise the supervisory board of the China Securities Regulatory Commission will not be able to sit on anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark laughed. "I really want to thank you, just because I always feel that there is something missing from the bed, just hang up your painting." "When he mentioned the phone, he dialed a number and told him in front of Godot. "I will immediately notify the three major exchanges and immediately stop the DreamWorks transaction." He will not wait for the other party to echo. On the phone, there was another number dialed. "There were two notices last night, the secret fonts 18956 and 18957, the first one was announced immediately, and the second one was announced."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hangs up and looks at Godo calmly. "The next thing we need to consider is how to put responsibility on others!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Less than a minute after Clark hanged the phone, the entire Emperor's telephone system was in a busy state, and there was even a small accident in which the operator was too busy to insert the wrong number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stock exchange of DreamWorks in the three major exchanges suddenly caused no panic, and some even thought it was a sign that DreamWorks would continue to expand its outstanding shares. Many people are even happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But after five minutes, the announcement of the announcement, everyone will be into the ice cave! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Empire Central Bank Stock Regime Trusteeship Office, Empire Stock Exchange Supervisory Board:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dream Factory (Code DWS.AAS) Temporarily suspends trading due to alleged violation of the Stock Exchange Law. All individuals or groups holding DreamWorks stock securities are invited to register with the EIT Offices of the three major exchanges. The specific matters will be further followed. Notice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, the three major exchanges on Xie Lisi Street were boiling, and countless investors were afraid to ask what happened to their stockbrokers. There are also many people in the stock brokerage circle who are asking, although they are not sure what happened, but these stockbrokers know clearly that DreamWorks is finished! These people lived almost on Xie Lisi Street. They were very sensitive to changes in stocks. In fact, some people noticed this when DreamWorks pulled up abnormally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they never said these things to customers, because it has nothing to do with them, even the frequent trading of high-priced stocks is that they get more commissions. The only way, they will not be silly to tell their customers not to buy a dream factory that can only bring hundreds of thousands of commissions to them, to buy those low-priced stocks with only a dozen dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big fraud case before, many investors have rushed to Xie Lisi Street from home or even outside, they have no other ideas, just want to Take your own principal back, but that is just a luxury dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the evening, the three major exchanges issued a new announcement, which detailed the reasons for the suspension of DreamWorks and asked the shareholders to be patient and calm. As a result of the wait, the Imperial Police Investigation Bureau has begun to investigate the case, and once there is any news, it will be announced to the public by the announcement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the seventh minute after the announcement was issued, a huge noise awakened all the people in the AAS exchange, they ran out of the deal. In the street, a circle was formed. A middle-aged man in front of him who looked very decent in front of him was lying on the ground. A large piece of blood continued to spread around. A pessimistic and panic mentality was constantly in the crowd. Fermentation until the emergence of the second jumper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several people on the top of the building, these people are wearing very expensive clothes, the worst is more than two hundred sets, they are sitting indifferently They are either crying and crying. They are not the same as other stocks. The funds they use to run stocks are borrowed from usury, or borrowed from the company, in addition to borrowed from their families. .... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people think that DreamWorks will break through new heights, these people are dominated by desires, so that they have done something they should not do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man stood up with a blank expression, he walked to the edge of the roof, turned his back to the street, watching other guys who were making choices They showed a smile. He sorted out his clothes, then waved his hand very quietly, silently saying goodbye, and the whole person fell backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
