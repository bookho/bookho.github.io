			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Mr. Nasha saw Mr. John, Mr. John’s looks looked very bad. He could feel that his life was about to reach the end. He was the only one at this time. Can't let go, Nasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really ridiculous to say that his most rebellious son finally became his most important person, and his most beloved son finally wanted to kill him. The reality gave him an absurd lesson, full of irony. John shook his head first, and a smile appeared on his dry face. His face was slightly blackened. This was the call for local metabolism to stop, which made his smile very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grandpa..." Nasa bit her lip in front of Mr. John and put her head on Mr. John's knee, the old man There are too many complicated lights that cannot be read in the eyes. His hand trembled and gently stroked on Nasha's head. He could not feel the suppleness of his hair, as if... there was no special feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The person who killed your father is Arthur. He will soon be punished as he should. I have already talked to the lawyer and the will will be changed." After I die, 50% of the family is owned by you, and 15% of the remaining 50% are for my brothers and sisters. In any case, we are all family. The rest Thirty-five percent of the donation will be donated to the empire, and a 'John George Foundation' will be established. This is why I let you come in person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old man said so much that his mouth was a bit dry, he let Nasha get a little water for him, moistened his lips and did not drink. The doctor told him that his body was experiencing a very alarming rate, which may be related to his sustained severe mental stimulation in a short time. Some blood circulation systems have been ruptured because of explosive high blood pressure, causing congestion in some places, and some places have lost blood to transport nutrients. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From partial failure to overall exhaustion, he can't hold much time. It is no longer a man's move to save him at this time, unless God delivers the gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he doesn’t talk about eating now, even drinking less water, can sustain life. Eating something or drinking water can cause local blood accumulation, which is a heavy burden for John's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Nasha wants to say, John did not give her this opportunity, raised her hand and stopped her. "I have arranged for the Foundation to do it. You will be the first chairman. As for the future, if you have no ability to continue. Control Foundation, you will be the honorary chairman, how much can still have something. The specific operation of this foundation is related to the news I have made for a lifetime, you can ask my lawyer."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your father is dead, and I don't think it will last long. Arthur will definitely go to jail. You are the last direct family in the family. Don't trust your grandparents. They are all for the money in your pocket."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have lost the newspaper industry, under the impetus of the cabinet and some people, the newspaper industry In the future, it will be difficult to see a giant like us. In the face of sporadic profits, more time and more money are needed, but the traditional newspaper industry can give up." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you in the shares of the Empire Star and people not pulled back?", Nasha rubbed her tears and nodded quietly, and John said with satisfaction: "Very good, this must be in the future." In the era of new media, I don't want to admit it, but the times have already left us. After you go back, talk to Du Lin. If you can buy the Empire Star, it is the best. You can't buy it and try to increase your hand. The equity on the board."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wave of future public opinion will shift from newspapers to this kind of visual medium." John sighed, perhaps afraid of Shah didn't understand or understand. He didn't have the slightest privacy. He told her the reason directly. "Because at least 30% of the people in the entire empire have not attended school, they can't read the newspaper, but they can look at it. The people in the little things read the news to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the economic recovery of the empire, I believe that it will not take years, this kind of thing will Widespread popularity..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John and Naza talk more than two hours, he thought to himself all things confessed side until he had to sit still, some limp in a wheelchair when the conversation ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the Imperial City Hall in the evening, Mr. John, who was in a wheelchair, announced to the public in the square that he had admitted all the charges against him. He bowed his head and expressed deep regret, and sincerely apologized to those who had been hurt by him... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The George family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demise of an industry trust is always more attractive than those that have not been officially confirmed. Under such circumstances, a handful of people have chosen Shut up, the public believes in the "truth." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Otis is still hot in many places and needs to be lined up. People's acceptance of tokens is also constantly increasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has brought great changes to the city. After the two railways are repaired, the city of Otis will completely replace the nano Lindes in the economy. Overtake the emperor's capital and become the most shining star of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "initiator" of all this is chatting with Mr. Kesma in the sun, Mr. Kesma has been eight months, and his body is very good. You can walk on your own. Mr. Kesma said that Mr. Xiaoxma would follow him. He would also be able to walk Du Lin himself in eight or nine months. By the way, he despised Du Lin’s wave and said that he would be able to walk on his own when he was over one year old. As for Mr. Kesma’s statement, is it true that Mrs. Kemas’s laughter can tell that he may have lied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Du Lin did not expose Mr. Kesma’s little lies. He has been climbing upwards in the past few years, and the memories in the dreams are constantly Coincidence, people have become more mature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma is a person who loves his face. Du Lin doesn’t want to turn into a quarrel with a phone full of affection. He compliments praised Kesma. A few words from Mr., I also expressed a little regret for myself. On the other side of the phone, Mrs. Xerma laughed louder, and Mr. Xerma snorted before driving his wife out of the mayor’s office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr. Xerma was alone in the room, he whispered: "Your unmarried wife may be pregnant again."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma robbed Mr. Xiaoxma and left two people to watch over there. Although Du Lin did not say anything, he always felt that doing things should be done. Decent, can not leave a message. Alisa went to the city of Otis. He knew it. After he came back, he started a normal life, worked, went to work, and occasionally went out with his colleagues. It was not much different from normal people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are other things in the human stomach. The Tibetans can’t hide. When the people there told Mr. Kesma that he might have another grandson, the old man walked into his studio with a slap in the face. I couldn’t help but laugh when I closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now informs Doolin that he is only giving Doolin a shot, and that’s the day, the second Mr. Maxma or the woman in the middle of next year. He is very happy to be born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not very kind to these children, but he is very kind to his grandchildren. He and Du Lin said that Mr. Xiaoxma is outside the office. Taking a chicken from someone else's house and running around, I asked a question, "What did you say to me last time, when did you do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Du Lin touched his chin. "Are you talking about Mennon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Mennon." Just filled with a warm atmosphere, there is a kind of unspeakable Sen. "He almost hurts the members of our family. No matter who he is, he must pay the price! In the past, I even dared to kill the Duke. Now it is It’s time for you to prove yourself, my son.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma’s life is a legendary life, according to his younger, the Duke of Empires is no longer Having the power to establish a Principality can still be a huge mountain in the imperial aristocracy that people have to look up to. Rich, right, human, and military, it can be said that his territory is his country, but there is no official name. But such a duke that even the royal family must respect, died under the double gun of Mr. Xerma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you follow the current official position as a reference standard, it should be almost the character of Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma has not complied with the law for the rest of his life, so he does not take the law as one thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duo Lin, who heard the word "family" from his mouth, suddenly had some embarrassment. He remembered some childhood things. The people in the town were more than a decade ago. The word family was used in the family of the family, and Mr. Xema was also convinced of such vocabulary. When he was a child, Du Lin might feel very glorious. On the other hand, he felt a little shameful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a rural farmer’s family, with the special vocabulary of the family, is it too exaggerated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
