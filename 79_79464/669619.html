			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?", after all the Buddhas sent Prando, "I don’t think it makes much sense to do this, maybe it’s my brain. Stupid, can't think of anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pointed to the Buddha and made a "right answer" action. All Buddhas really don’t understand. Now they have a lot of troubles, they should have been hidden, but Du Lin’s two things are too arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you say that the mad dog Weisen is his own way of life, it is also a last resort to do so. It is not a big deal to disappear one person or two people in a city. . Every day, there are always some people who will have some accidents like this, or suddenly have an epiphany, want to say that they are leaving and leave, and leave here. But it’s not normal to die a dozen guys who form a social network in one breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, although it may lead to a series of uncontrollable consequences, but also to protect the security of Doolin. So what about the car washer? Does Du Lin, who doesn't always hurt, lose his name? Although he did do something that should not be done, the red fruit peeled his skin in the park, it will definitely attract some people's attention. Everyone knows that the criminal law of peeling and the Guarts are still doing this, which is equivalent to putting themselves at risk. Once someone associates the experience of the car wash with the reward of Prando, it is equivalent to telling others. En is our people, you all shut up." It is too stupid and naive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has no explanation for the confusion of the Buddha. Some things you understand, you can understand without anyone else explaining. But there are some things that you don't understand and don't understand. Even if you explain it to you, you are confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the situation is really tight, but it doesn't mean you can't do anything. On the contrary, Du Lin believes that the more nervous the situation, the more it should be mixed. When the car wash is finished, people will think that this is what the Guarts do. Those on the street who don't have a proper job will think that Du Lin is doing it, because in their world, the Guar are equal to Doolin, and Du Lin is the most famous one, and it is natural to represent all the Guars. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what do people think in the upper class? They are standing at a higher position and have reached a level that exceeds the hierarchy of the lower class. For them, the Guarts are not equal to Doolin, but equal to Heidler. They would think that Heidler is the true representative of the Guartes and can represent the existence of the Guarts in the city. He met all the speculations of the high society against the behind-the-scenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich, the status, the most important thing is that he is a Guar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the upper class will be directed to Heidele by this cruel torture, while the bottom residents will be deterred by the death of the car washmen. Choose a temporary shut up. Few people know that the car wash is half the blood of the Guar people. They will consider whether the madman of Doolin has already brought the Guar's punishment to other ethnic groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a relatively safe buffer period, Mrs. Vivienne was able to do what she needed to do to break the deadlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arranging a few people to surrender, there is naturally a reason. The entire city of Teñel is actually divided in a strict sense, and only two areas can be divided - free and not free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free nature is the people living in the city, and those who are not free are the people in the prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living in a world where money can be bought in everything (refer to Kevin’s case of helping a wretched teacher win a sexually abusive female student), no one dares Make sure you will not go to jail. Sometimes it may be just a small thing that will lead an innocent person into prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the overall plan of Doolin, the prison will also become an important part, so he needs to send a little person in advance to form a stable force to assist He manages some things in the prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no explanation for the Buddha shrugging, he knows that Doolin has his own ideas, this is enough, "You are boss, what you said ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin deeply nodded, "Yes, I said!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At this time, in a luxurious manor in Orodo, the capital of Cannes, the former governor, who was lying in bed and lost his consciousness, was buried in a woman in her twenties. In his arms, he is as greedy as an old baby, sucking sweet and fragrant. This is not what he wants to do. He can't do anything like this now. This is what his private doctor told him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's ** has many hormones and other things needed for growth and development. Under the various treatments, the doctor suggested that the former governor do this. Replace most food with human breast milk. ** is rich in all kinds of nutrients, which can satisfy most of the human body's needs for survival, but some foods that may be relatively rare are prone to continuous hunger. Therefore, there are ten people in the manor waiting for the former Governor to "replenish nutrition and essential hormones" anytime and anywhere. The little woman who has just given birth to the child is ready to call anytime and anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
