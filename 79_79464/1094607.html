			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of his wife, who just recognized it, Williams said very clearly, "I need more, so I need your help! ", then he told his wife's income during this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This half-month of joint construction has been very slow, but it is stable, and it has made his account profit more than 100,000 on an intermittent basis. The export business earns a lot more, and it is also simple and leisurely. This made his wife and brother covet, and then he forgot what Befford told him. He didn't reveal the news. He took the initiative to tell his wife why he wanted to gamble because he had a very accurate source. And he also explained the operation principle of the stock, even if there is a loss, it will not kill people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a loss after the direct sale of the stop loss, but the loss cannot be as terrible from one hundred to zero, perhaps from one hundred to ninety-five. A little more, it will be in place after it becomes eighty. The money in his hands and the money to be borrowed are combined into one, so don't worry about not getting the loans of the financial companies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case when the gambling loses, but once it wins? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Mr. Mark, he has doubled his funds in a month or two, and he can redeem his house. The car and everything, and a large sum of money in hand to continue investing in the financial sector. Maybe it will take a few years for him to return to the peak and even climb a higher mountain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife and brother are not as optimistic as he is, after pondering for a moment, he asks, "I need to declare a point first. If you borrow too much, you need to have Some things that avoid risk, such as the house and the car here. In addition, how much do you plan to borrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams and the bank signed a loan agreement after the federal bank He did not take away his property rights. The house is too big to be used. If you can't take it, you can't install it into the bank's vault. For this reason, the pledge of the real estate is generally resolved through legal channels. That is to say, this house of Williams is no longer able to carry out any form of trading, property rights can not be transferred, which gives him a chance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After lunch at noon, the two went to an office building in the city center under the leadership of his wife and brother, and saw his wife’s brother on the ninth floor. A friend, the chairman of a finance company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the face of Williams' wife, the chairman of the finance company gave him 600,000, the full amount, and slightly reduced the interest. If he can pay the money within three months, he only needs to pay the financial amount of 820,000. If the principal and loan cannot be repaid after three months, they will directly terminate the agreement and take the lawsuit. Take the Williams house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very reasonable. The interest rate in the usury is not too high. It can even be said that it is a real financial lending service based on the concept of serving the people, even the usury. Not counted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Williams signed his name and Social Security number, the money has been credited to his Commonwealth bank account. After saying a few words without nutrition, his wife sent Williams to leave. After watching Williams leave his car, the oily face of his wife returned to the finance company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, brother, listen to me, I want to borrow a little money, how much do you think I can take from you?", he said William Si gave his happy land to the chairman of the Fortune Company, who picked up the sniff and satisfactorily tore the cigarette holder and slammed it on his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a smog of smoke, his face was filled with a smile that relaxed to the extreme, "Great, authentic imperial goods." Lazy, "I can lend you money, we are friends, but before I lend you money, you have to tell me what you need to do this money, when can I return it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Williams’s wife repeated the words Williams said to him, which immediately caught the interest of the chairman of the finance company. During this time, many people borrowed money to make his business very good. He also knew that these people took money to invest in stocks or foreign exchange, and earned more money from them. Sometimes he also has a dim itch that he wants to try to invest in financial products, but he doesn't know anything about it or believe in stock brokers who speak well. Among the people he has seen, the stockbroker has instigated the wrong project, and the bankruptcy is not infrequent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time is different, because the brother-in-law of this bastard is a real business owner, the internal news he got must be true, which makes him feel ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give you 200,000, no more, this message counts the interest on this money, understand?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
