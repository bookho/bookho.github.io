Unfortunately, this good news may need to continue. Going on, the bad news comes first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood knows Mrs. Vivian, it is no exaggeration to say that as one of the city's tycoons, he is often the face that often appears in the big party banquet. However, he never said anything to others. In fact, he didn't like it very much, because he didn't feel how many big people respected him. They even used the nickname "Woodwood" to ridicule him from the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he had to be there again, his lifelong pursuits were in that small circle, and it’s hard to squeeze in, how could he not hesitate? Leave? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these things don’t happen, he may still think as he used to, one day he can embark on the road of politics, so that he will be the most Most of the savings are on this road. He had intended to submit an application for the election at the end of the term of the two members of the city of Tener, two years later, but all of this was painted with a terminator a few days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some inexplicable ease in my heart, and there is hatred of loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some confused thoughts were quickly picked up by him. After a little indulging, he nodded and said, "You made a mistake!", Song Duo He looked at him very seriously. The expression was like a student who was sitting in the classroom and studying hard. This made Wood somewhat more satisfying. "You shouldn't come forward to meet Prando, and you shouldn't talk to him." Do you think that he really felt that he was under heavy pressure, and that he was driving into the police car and swaying in the face of dissatisfaction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you are wrong. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His goal is to tell everyone that he, the director of the Tenel City Regional Police Department, has come to you. Only then can he It’s not hard to imagine that I’m taking it out of this matter. At the level of Mrs. Vivian’s, she’s absolutely impossible to reach out to this gang called Cod. She doesn’t even know who this guy is, what it’s called, And who is behind. So she went to find Prando, at that time, the responsibility was Rondo on the shoulders, if not find Cod, Mrs. Vivian to get angry, it is definitely a multi-prong victims "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"But when he swayed and came to you in full view, it was equivalent to handing over the responsibility to you, and you took it with your hands like an idiot, turning this responsibility into a noose and putting it around your neck." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s face is ugly, in front of Wood...at least in the current situation, he does not need to maintain a false face, Wood is “coming over” He can understand his feelings. But what he didn't think was that there was such a thing behind this incident, which gave Codor an unspeakable feeling, just like being fooled by himself, taking on the original that did not belong to him. responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath, calmed down his emotions and lowered his voice and asked: "I don't want to hear this, I just want to know if I look for Less than Cod, how can I get through the current difficulties?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood did not answer, but instead talked about another topic, "You know How do we deal with people like you?", waiting for the opening of Gotall, Wood continued: "We will arrange a crime for you, send you to the district prison, and then you have been humiliated. The little character will slap you from behind you when you are not paying attention. He will add three or fifty years of imprisonment, and then inexplicably die in various accidents for some time to come, and you die. The gang fights. There is no doubt that this is the easiest way to deal with it, and it will not cause any major disturbances. Your men will choose new leaders and then retaliate."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the trouble is solved, we have combed the city again. A certain factor, a lot of extravagant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when the anger of Codor is about to erupt, Wood just raised his hand and pressed, "To solve the present Trouble...how to say it, to say it is difficult, in fact, it is not so difficult to say, but also some means. You must first take yourself out of this matter, just as Prando did, push the responsibility Give it to others. Then you have to bring the gift to Mrs. Vivian, and take the initiative to admit the mistake, then take back the responsibility and listen to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood's suggestion Let Codor be a little confused and look at the confusion in his eyes. Wood smiled and shook his head. "I finally calmed down in the past few days. At that time, I was really stupid. Robben clearly told the truth. I am, I just ignore it and make a big mistake, so don't think that I am stupid, I am not stupid, nor crazy!" At this time, Wood gradually came to his senses from pain and impulsiveness. He had a few days ago. Still thinking about how to retaliate back, how to expand your pain tenfold, hundred Retaliation to call that kid who went to Turin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
