			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than a month, Buck became dark and thin, but also more spiritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a little nervous when he faced Du Lin. The name of Doolin and the deeds under this name made him know what awe is. Maybe his parents have not taught him to learn to fear, but here he has learned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The direct cause of this result came from the East Coast, where he and Edward’s destination were Emperor. As a core area of ​​imperial culture and politics, there will naturally be many academic celebrities, and the headquarters of some private hospitals will also be established in the capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Edward, a scholar of the academic world, they have seen many scholars and doctors who have a certain reputation in the empire, but it is a pity that the other party does not see them. Or, don't look at the city of Otis behind them. For these scholars and doctors who are mixed in the Imperial Capital, they are no longer simply simple money. They have long been more ambitious pursuits and ideals. It is not easy to use money to impress them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people have seen the reality, the atmosphere of the south and east coast is more open than the strong political atmosphere of the northern part of the empire, where the people who work are pursuing The relative simplicity is just money. Buck and Edward spent a week in the emperor and took the boat to the east coast. The east coast of the East Coast is one of the most developed areas of the imperial economy. The more developed areas, the more thieves there are. When they first arrived in a city, they were targeted by a group of thieves, and then their things were stolen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people went to the police station to report that they had been stolen, and the police made a transcript for them, only told them when they left. The case may not be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more than a million people in the entire city. It is not difficult to find a few thieves from these people. It is difficult to find thieves who have stolen their things. It is very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police resources of any city are limited. It is impossible to waste a small number of police forces in the entire city for a theft. The police did not lie and did not let them Living in an impossible fantasy, even telling them to contact them if there is news in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghost knows when, maybe in a few days, the thief will be found for a private case of contraband, and it may be impossible for the other person to catch it for the rest of his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck was very annoyed with the name of Doolin because their money and some information were in the stolen trolley. They are now penniless, and there is no other way than to ask Du Lin for help. Who knows that the police who received them heard the voice of Buck's name "Dulin" and chased it and asked if it was Elian's Doolin. Buck immediately told him that it was Mr. Dulion’s 350,000 Mr. Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police re-returned them back to a staff lounge in the police station, which contained not only billiards but also some other loose toys in fifteen minutes. After that, the policeman appeared in front of them with their lost trolley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please check the two, is there anything missing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck looked at that The policeman glanced at him and Edward began to count the things in the trolley. Just as he was ready to say nothing, Edward suddenly inserted a sentence - the money was wrong. Buck looked at him. He nodded at Buck. When he was on board, Edward counted in the cabin. They had a total of 1,300 pieces of cash. There are also some small coins and small denominations of banknotes, which add up to about thirty or forty dollars. But here is one thousand and five hundred pieces, and the change is more than fifty. How is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, before Edward explained, the police let them take a little rest and then left for five minutes. After five minutes, he walked in with two thousand pieces of cash and smiled and said: "The thief who stole your things told him that he had hidden two thousand." Blocks, all here, you can click again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Buck and Edward got the intent of several scholars and doctors to leave the city, they bought A local newspaper with a photo of a man hanged on a street lamp in the suburbs. The newspaper wrote an article for this photo, stating that this person is a thief, and may have been punished by a local gang for stealing something that should not be stolen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One big and one small two men with deep fear, ran through the East Coast with great pains, and finally made everything that Du Lin told them to do. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time standing in the office, Buck’s heart is very nervous, and he realizes that sometimes what he sees is not necessarily true. Who can think of just because of a name, let things that are almost impossible to find back appear in front of them for fifteen minutes, and even let a person lose his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward, who is next to him, also put away the temperament of his academic old oil, and even some humility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t say anything about this trip. As for why they did this, they didn’t know it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So is our hospital and school staff enough?" Du Lin looked at the two lists they had, with scholars And the doctor's hope for the salary, as well as their resume. Du Lin casually browsed it. These people are not the best, but they are not the worst and can be used. He put the two lists together and put them in the drawer, which is one of the next major jobs in the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A city can have no place to entertain, but there must be a hospital and a higher level school. He was deeply touched when he went to the hospital in Nal Lindes. If there is a hospital in the city of Otis, he does not need to hold a bloody arm and face a little white to go to Nano Lindes, where he can get everything done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two responded, and Du Lin’s face showed a satisfied smile. He nodded. “You did a good job. The rest of the things are also given. I stare well, give you three months, I want to see the hospital and high school and the establishment of the university. The specific cost to give me a budget, my requirements are not many, must be advanced, must be beautiful." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending these two guys, Du Lin was busy with the things in his hands. Suddenly he put down his pen and was a bit curious about how the Cape family would move next. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he didn’t think that this trick was not used on him, but on Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the idea of ​​the Cape family owner, Du Lin would call him anyway after seeing the personal letter, but the truth is not. Not only did not have a phone call, but even someone else did not have a message, which made him realize that he had tried his best to resolve this contradiction, but Du Lin did not seem to eat this set. So he called Margots and hoped to accomplish the purpose of the consortium in other ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin is not willing to compromise, then they don’t have to die with Doolin, Otis can’t, then can’t the rest go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singer consortium made a very gorgeous investment project proposal for people to give to Magus, then the owner of the Cape family contacted Magma S, telling him that if the singer consortium can get a casino license in other places, they will invest at least 20 million in the local area, promise to provide at least 20,000 jobs, help the empire to develop a city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This request was rejected by Magus, who preferred Doolin's plan compared to this plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So things seemed to be deadlocked here until Harry contacted Du Lin again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I always thought that you were a big person, I didn't expect you to forgive them, is it because their sincerity is not enough?", Harry's tone this time Not so stiff, with a bit of persuading tone, Magus did not make a statement after the last time Du Lin was in trouble, which made him realize that Du Lin's current status is very special, not very moving. A mature politician will never have an unshakable political stance. In the past he was a rotten aristocratic class. Now he is an enlightened new party member. Nothing is eternal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin chuckled, "Harry, this matter is related to the overall layout of the city of Otis, not that I don't want to give them some convenience, but Their demands will undermine my planning and design of the city. What I need is a real SAR, not an amusement park for some people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True Harry can't do it anymore?" Harry sighed. "Som hopes to meet with you, right. It's the current owner of the Cape family. He is not very good. He can go to the emperor from the north." Come to see you, I believe that he is full of sincerity, can't you see him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My work is very busy, there is no time for the moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Dooling’s refusal, Harry had already expected it. He said that he would hang up after a few words that didn’t hurt. It’s clear that this contradiction will definitely escalate. Because the Cape family has come up with the greatest sincerity. Somme’s body is no longer able to let him work for a long time, so he is willing to come to the emperor and talk to Du Lin personally, and has been able to explain many problems. Doolin’s refusal to make the slightly tempered situation worse will be worse, but it has nothing to do with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shrugged his shoulders, looked at his watch, waited for about seven or eight minutes, and the office door was ringing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in!", Harry sorted out his dress a little, sitting behind his desk with a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit fat man with a hair waxing is coming in. He was wearing a plaid vest and a plaid trench coat outside, which made him look more bloated. He took off his hat and took a suitcase and nodded and walked into Harry's office with a sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
