			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Waterworks, power plants, oil plants, coal plants...", Doolin sits in the room of a manor in Henry, on the outskirts of Villier, here It is the current gathering place of the country club. At this time, the members of the country club gathered here for the second time. Du Lin is facing the interests of these big people. "Gentle, this is a market with nearly 600,000 people. Large-scale business, each month, these people need at least two dollars in the use of infrastructure services, and half of the profits after the cost, which is 600,000!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We all know that there are twelve months in a year. I want to thank the people who taught me to count, let me know at least 600,000 profits per month, seven hundred and twenty months. The profit of 100,000, except those taxes, has at least a profit of not less than 6.45 million. So I think that if you have some money in your hands, you may want to consider investing some foundations in these three towns. Facilities. I will reveal one more here. Interest, these three towns are likely to be upgraded to cities and three immigrant cities in the next three to five years!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra as The only woman in the room, she is more sensitive to the changes in the details. "Do you mean that the empire will expand the scope of immigration and send all subsequent immigrants to the west? If this is the case, then invest Some funds are not impossible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How big can they be?" Henry later raised a question that others would like to know. "I mean three to five years later, the three places that have been upgraded to cities. How many people will live? How many people will there be? How many people will there be in the entire west? Why do they want immigrants to come to the west?" Instead of sending it to other places?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin snorted. "You have a lot of questions, but I will still answer your questions patiently. "This is the advantage of Doolin and never discriminates against mental retardation." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In my estimation, these three cities will accommodate at least 1.5 million people in five years, and these demographics will be More than 70% of the workforce is labor force, they will create great wealth. According to the expenditure standard I just told you, after five years, the population of 1.5 million people will not be lower than at least every month. Four million infrastructure services, we assume that the profit is still half, which is the profit of two million per month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" As for Mr. Henry asked How many people are in the entire West? I think you should ask the state government instead of asking me, but I believe that it will not be less than 4 to 5 million people."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third question, why do they come to the west!" Du Lin looked around at the big capitalist sitting in the room and smiled and said: "Because there is a soil suitable for them to survive!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The economy in the south and east of the empire has shown a trend of rapid expansion. In the west, there is a 50-dollar income in one month, which can guarantee the basic life of two people, probably The balance of more than ten dollars. But in other parts of the empire, fifty dollars can only guarantee one person's survival for a month, and there will not be too much balance. I know that you may feel that the salary in other places will be higher. One point, but please note that there is no need to have special skills to work in the West, but in other places, high-tech jobs will gradually account for half or more of the total number of social jobs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Works without technical content or low-tech content have become saturated, and there are not enough jobs available to these refugees. They cannot survive in the empire. In the end, there will be an ending, that is, to leave the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the west can, all the work in the west does not need to have a certain technical skill, here It takes only the strength to plant, mine and mine natural resources, and I believe that the industrial transformation will soon take place in the west, from the current single resource exploitation to the largest light and heavy industrial factory in the Empire. The cheaper labor costs will make more The people choose to set up factories in the west, while the high-income, high-income and high-income areas are difficult to adapt to the developed areas. On the other hand, they are low-income middle-income but have no threshold for immigrants to familiarize themselves with the western rhythm of the empire. What do you think they will choose? The place as the first home in the empire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is a more important social issue that Du Lin did not say, that is, social group conflicts, Even if new immigrants came to the empire and ran to economically developed areas, Doolin had enough ways to make them cry and join the west. Family. This is why he values ​​immigration, because these and later immigrants do not have any foundation in the empire. They all do not have any anti-risk ability like duckweed, so they need a different kind of The living environment in which society currently exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, this group of people gathered together through simple processing and transformation, and has a powerful force, this power is not like any existing in the empire Groups or classes, they have little sense of identity with the Yaoxing Empire, and there is no psychological fear of the nobles of this country including those nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry seemed to understand, and he nodded. "This is a good business. I can invest some money, two million."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shand Pulling thoughtfully, but she quickly gave her own answer, "I believe you, Doolin, so I also invested two million, but I have a request, I want my investment to be distributed as much as possible. On the water plant.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orvili Mining Group has a water plant, which is slower to make money than other infrastructure. But the profit margin is extremely horrible. Because as long as he is an individual, he must drink water, and drink every day, and not only drink once. Nowadays, the water plants in the empire have set three to six grades of commodity water according to the difference in water quality. At present, only the highest level of water quality in the imperial capital exists, and it can be directly consumed and can also promote the health of the body. water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than three to five grades in other places, from the cheapest penny to a bucket of water, to the royal family and the big guys for five dollars A bucket of water, the profit inside the water can be said to be huge profits! Because all the water comes from nature, there is no need for cultivation, no need for care, no need to dig a hoe, and as long as the water source is found, it will generate a steady stream of profits, so Sandra, who knows about the water plant, The child is eyeing this business that doesn't seem to make much money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Clarence also wanted to take the water plant. The Jindis Mining Group also has a subordinate department that operates the water plant. How much are these large mining companies actually? Shaodu has some water plants. In the early days, these people had holes in the empire, and it was inevitable that they would encounter some water sources with good water quality. It would be a pity if they were thrown away in vain, so as a compensation for exploration failure, they would operate these water sources themselves. Get up, or resell it to others to operate, knowing how terrible the profit of the water plant is, it is really a profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I invest 1.5 million. If I can, I personally hope to invest in the power plant." Perhaps this is the speech of Clilan. Everyone became enthusiastic and they realized that this was the first “meal” of the country club. If you don't take the initiative, you may only have bone slag left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just half an hour, Du Lin raised nearly $16 million in investment, enough to temporarily build some infrastructure for refugees. At least able to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After splitting the piece of cake, Carlos asked with some blunt tone. "Mr. Du Lin, how can Mr. Mennon solve the problem? I pass me." A friend of mine learned that the investigation team from the Imperial Capital did not seem to intend to oust the peasant. If he did not step down, I think he would have a certain impact on our business in the west."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
