			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, with children, just a hundred days, there is a big <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second Recently, I am considering continuing to open and trying to write a new book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one will not explain, talk about the second one, and then say something off topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time I went to Shanghai and the big brothers. Although everyone discussed a lot of dirty things, there are some real things. Someone said that you are not arguing, no one will give you, everyone will finish the book and close x directly. Only if you want it, will you have a ticket to recommend and reward. In fact, I understand this truth, but am I such a person? From the Pope to the present, I have never wanted anything except the one or two collections in the new book period. I write, you see, this is the duty, there is no need to ask too much, I am not dying all day, the family is dying, today is not the endangered tomorrow is that the disease is not allowed to let the reader directly Give me an account for money (manually funny). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give, I think I wrote well and encouraged me. Do not give, as the above said is the duty. I am very grateful to everyone who gave me a reward. This is the only thing I can do with everyone in the author group. Hey, I am a red, let a group of more street The guy is red-eyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book was edited at the beginning of the book and I said, can be written as cool, but I refused. I said a word to the editor-in-law - please let me be willful. Last time, I just want to write something I want to write. When I am willing to bow to the market and compromise, how do you say how do I write? . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the original words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that there will be no readers in this writing, just as Rosie, Ryan, and Doolin in the book say, everyone must act for themselves. Pay the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have never regretted it. People always have to be willful. I always know that I will fall and run a few times on the rugged road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missed this time, maybe not the next time. Life is short, brothers, when I am still young (he), when I can still touch the tail of youth, I will be willful again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
