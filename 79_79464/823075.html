			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of Doolin’s dream, price reunification is the most effective means to combat the proliferation of cross-border behavior, and even some companies have made no profit. The means of returning to such a madness, that is, the price that the supplier gives to the agent is the final selling price. The agent does not make money to sell things, but after selling the goods, the "evidence" left by the supplier in the goods is left. For example, a brand, or some shells left after sale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the next checkout, the supplier will give them sufficient profits according to the "evidence" provided by the agent, or it can be said to be a rebate. But in fact, any means can not control the birth of the string of goods, because of the interests. As long as there are still interests, even a little less, or even meager, but in the face of huge sales, it is far more than the honest can make more money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Du Lin has no good way to do this. He must first guarantee the profits of these agents. They not only need to make money for themselves, but also You need to support your own team and you need to help those who need relief. But as long as you leave enough profit margins, you will definitely find holes in these people. Of course, the only advantage of Doolin is that although he is a businessman, he is not a complete businessman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he decides something, he can't reason with anyone. The agent does not respect the rules he and he set, then change an agent. The entire region is resisting his rules of the game, so stop the supply of the entire region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin paused for a moment, then raised his head slightly, the sun shone on his face, and the whole person became dazzling. His eyes swept over people's faces, and then he smiled. "Who else has to say? If not, then I will continue to say, this time, I don't want anyone to interrupt me again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westbucks moved his lips, and finally said nothing, his face turned slightly dull, and whispered something to the people around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at everyone in the room and proved that no one would say anything more, he continued, "Third, starting next month, you At least on the respective sites, a free school is set up to provide the same children in the area to school, and free Chinese food and dinner must be provided. In addition, a cheap hospital must be established before the end of this year. So that all Guarts can see the disease."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Gentlemen...” Du Lin looked at the few women among these people. “Ladies, remember, when you have too much wealth beyond others, what you have to do is not I am optimistic about my own money, but give back to this society. The empire has given us unfair treatment, we can only save ourselves, we have to give back to those who are still in trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I always think that a person of integrity, a successful person, he must first have a sense of social responsibility, and this is what I hope everyone can have, to be a rich man with a conscience!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I gave you the opportunity to change your destiny, and also asked you to give other compatriots a chance to change their destiny. I don't want you to give them wealth, as long as you give them a chance to learn. The environment, the opportunity to advance. After many years, you will understand that when some of them become the middle class of society and become the elite of society to thank you, you will find what you have done, ratio Deposits in the bank will make you happy and make you happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people nod their heads, indeed, they have a harder attitude than others. There was always no chance until Du Lin appeared. Moreover, in order to improve the class and status of the Guar people in society, they must be fully integrated into this society and assume more important responsibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be recognized by everyone. It’s not much money to build a free school. The money is for those agents who have hundreds of thousands of accounts every day. Business is a small amount of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fourth point, I need you to build a gult church in the city where you live in the city where you live, and establish a fellowship club. I will arrange for the president of the branch..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Du Lin, let me put in a sentence...", Du Lin looked at Sibak, the latter Standing expressionlessly, facing Du Lin's gaze, "Mr. Du Lin, I agree with the above three points, but I don't quite understand the fourth point. I hope you can explain it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and motioned to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As everyone knows, you are the president of the fellowship association, then the fellow country association we formed must also obey your guidance and instructions. Please forgive my rudeness. Are you hoping to take us over this way?", Westbucks’ emotions are a little excited. "Can we be yours?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;The fellowship, the people present here did not understand the word for the first time on the first day. From the moment Du Lin appeared in front of them, the concept of the fellowship went deep into their hearts. This is a "social group organization" that completely obeys the orders of Doolin, and it has a strong deterrent. Their first business, almost all members of the fellowships, took them from the hands of others, and there may be violence, bloodshed, or even death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not gentle, it’s a daunting group organization. They all thought it was acceptable in the first three points, but Sibak felt that this fourth point was absolutely unacceptable, especially when Du Lin said that he would arrange for the president to be elected, instead of being seated by these people, not just Sibuck, and everyone else has a bit of worry. Once the fellowships are established, these people will be brainwashed under Du Lin's proposed charter and become a thoroughly "Dulin." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Doolin feels that these agents are useless, maybe the fellows will take away all their stuff, which is terrible, so Westbucks One stood up. He has offended Du Lin once and doesn't mind being offended once. I am not doing it. He now has a lot of resources in his hands. He wants someone to have money, and he needs money to have a site. This empire is not the only Du Lin family that supplies private wine, there are other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not go back and cut off business with Doolin, change one is, at least those people will not think about arranging a fellowship that will explode anytime and anywhere By the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at Sibak, and Sibak also looked at Du Lin reluctantly until Du Lin shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his eyes and looked at other people, "As I said before, all I did was not to make money, but to make money. I have given you a part of the plan. I gave you the opportunity to give you wealth and give you everything that is valued and respected. I have been paying, and I also hope that I will have enough rewards to reward me. Everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Sibak’s question is very sharp, I can say here responsibly, the establishment of the fellowship is not for any of you here. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have a firm belief in the thousands of years since the establishment of the Guardian dynasty, but after the demise of the country, The Ogdin people ruined our faith. Faith is a very pure thing. With faith, we are not afraid of sacrifice. With faith, we can re-enter the sun."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that one day any gult will walk on the street, and will welcome the smile of passers-by. Even if the person coming on the face does not smile, he will not treat the Guar with contempt and contempt. To achieve this goal, this ideal, we need to have a fellowship, need to have faith!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you have not answered my question, you intend to take us overhead "Oh?", Sibak stood up again. "You asked us to comply with every request you made, and asked us to abide by the rules you made. You asked us to obey you, but you have not told us that you can do it for us. Do something. Mr. Doolin, this is a cai." He looked a little relieved and smiled slightly at the other person. "I am sorry, Mr. Doolin, I am a little uncomfortable, I quit first, hope. You can forgive..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gunshot ended Sibak’s speech, and all Buddha went to Sibak’s side and looked at the head lying on the floor. The guy who broke, a little helpless Dragged elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshots made everyone’s heart tremble, and even the “successors” who sat next to the conference were scared to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin taught the pistol to the Buddha who came back again, and everyone was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s face with a little apology, whispered: “Now someone has withdrawn, is there another one?”, the smiles on his face are gradually Converging, revealing a trace of embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned, walked back and forth a few steps, his eyes swept over the faces of everyone. "Gentlemen, ladies, please don't forget, too. Remember this. I can give it to you, but I can take it. I know that some of you want to make money, want wealth and more status, including power. Yes, I will not interfere, but I must follow my rules. Come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can say that I am dictatorial like Mr. Sibak, or you can swear at me in secret. This is your power and freedom, I will not interfere. As long as you have not broken my rules. But if you destroy, I am sorry, you should know, we can sit together and get along with each other, discuss how to make money, how to implement great plans, because we are friends." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If one day we are not friends..." Du Lin laughed happily. "So we are enemies!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
