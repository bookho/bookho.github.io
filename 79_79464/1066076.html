			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Doolin in Irian met with Nasha. Nasa helped Dulin unconditionally in the first few times, so some dulins needed people. Knowing things through the tape to the mainstay of the empire, the middle class, this makes Du Lin very grateful, so this cable TV conference, he wants to give Nasha a position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is a very simple person, also a person who loves and hates, you help me, then I will remember you, not because of both sides The change in status and the change in status made him forget these things. People living in this world must not only learn toughness, but also learn to be grateful. Only when they are grateful, the road will become better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha came only one person, Nasha and Nasa a few years ago have changed a lot, even can be said to be completely Two people. Today, she was wearing a casual lady's formal dress. When she pushed the car out of the car, the wind on the east coast picked up her hair and clothes. She wore sunglasses and pressed her hair in one hand. One hand obscured the strong sunlight on the east coast, and at the moment she saw Du Lin, she smiled and then the money came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the collapse of the George family had nothing to do with Doolin, he could even smile at this "enemy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Nasha is still a very remarkable woman, at least among the women Du Lin knows, Nasha can definitely squeeze into the top five, especially the fall of the George family. The latter state is enough to make her superior to many women. There are always people who say that when a person experiences something like a disaster, it will mature overnight. Nasha is such a person. The fall of the George family and the closeness of their loved ones did not destroy her, but gave her a strong heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Empire Star and the Star Empire are the most powerful counterattacks against the people who sang the George family. Under the guidance of Nasha, these two companies Sweeping the entire tape market, firmly occupying more than 60% of the tape business, known as the "strip tape queen" ... although this title is a bit strange to say no. At the same time, she used the money she earned from the two companies to buy the line of her uncle's hand. Now she has become the tycoon who holds the largest number of theaters in the hands of the Imperial Single Company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those things that many men can’t do have made her do it. It’s not easy, and she has a very keen business sense and management experience. Du Lin met with her this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your girlfriend?" Nasha glanced at Kinsale, who was sitting around Doolin, and placed her handbag on the table, making her character more masculine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at Kinsale and said with a smile, "If she is my girlfriend, I might be mad at vomiting blood." I couldn’t help but laugh. In the past few days, he was so annoyed by Kinsale that he was finally able to get rid of it. This is really a happy thing. "Introduction, this is my sister, Kinsale." Then he kicked Kinsale. "This is Ms. Nasha. The tape you see is produced by her company. This time you want to be the star's hope, also on Ms. Nasha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bit of boring Golden Elton’s interest, and the very lady and Nasha shook hands. “I really like those tapes, I look at it every day! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha glanced at Du Lin and then replied with a smile. "You can be very happy with me, thank you!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Kinsale was about to say something, Du Lin said a shut up, then gave her ten dollars and let her go out. After Jinsel’s very dissatisfied departure, Du Lin began the formal topic today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know cable TV?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cable TV, what is that?", Nasha shook her head in disappointment. For her now, maintaining two tape companies and developing the cinema line market is the right choice. Mr. John, her grandfather, the founder of the George family, Mr. John George, told Nasha before she died, asking her not to hate Du Lin and maintain a good relationship with Du Lin. Also let her not continue to do the newspaper business, because she can not suppress those newspapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John made two suggestions to Nasha. The first point is to find a way to join the tape business. In the future, tape is definitely one of the mainstream. When advances in technology have led to a significant reduction in the cost of players and tapes, almost every household has a player. As long as there is a player, they will want to buy tape to play something. This is a huge market, a business that can last for twenty or thirty years, and therefore can lay a family-based business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is to continue to operate the cinema, people will have more money in their pockets, but the entertainment they can choose will not become more . Watching movies is obviously a cheaper entertainment than the higher cost of getting happiness. Although watching movies is very cheap, the money you earn from playing movies is definitely not cheap. When more and more movies appear in front of people, the cinema or theater will open a crazy money-raising mode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as they seize these two businesses, the George family will not really fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasa listened to Mr. John’s suggestion and has been running both business and doing a good job. I would like to thank her uncle and her uncle for her poor management, so that she has the opportunity to spend money to buy the backyard resources in those hands. A large number of theaters have now shown a certain degree of power, and often people will come to talk to her about the release of the event, but also through so many negotiations, let her know that the original theater to make money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The producer needs to play his own movie in her movie theater, and needs to give the corresponding screening fee, or give up a part of the proportion in the playback share. How many times a day is arranged, when it is scheduled, it is also necessary to talk, and it also costs. Every producer wants their movies to broadcast more games at the best time, then they must give more than others. More money. There are also a lot of things like promotion, advertising, events and the sale of the surrounding area that allow Nasha to get some money from it. This gives Nasha a very strange feeling, as if the filmmakers spent a lot of money on filming not to make money for themselves, but to make money for the theater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mastering these two businesses Nasha has been quite satisfied with the current situation, so Du Lin put forward a vocabulary she has not heard of, she did not show Too much interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I call the player a TV. Cable TV means a TV that needs to be connected to a cable, or a player." Nasha finally began to pay attention. Du Lin smiled and continued. "Now that our TV wants to have content, we need tape. You have done a good job in the past two years, and the market is firmly in your hands." But the emergence of cable TV will break this situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unending Nasha laughing, Du Lin hit her face with a punch," But cable TV is not the same as the TV we are seeing now. All the programs in the future do not need to be played by tape as a medium. Only when the TV is connected to a signal line, it can play the programs prepared by the TV station. Four hours of uninterrupted playback of different and very fresh programs. People can learn more about what is happening in this society, even immediacy, through cable TV!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viewers who like TV shows don’t need to wait for the episodes of the weekly episode. They can sit with their family to watch a variety of TVs every night after work.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
