			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Doolin’s dream, I’ve seen a contract that made him feel amazing now, and the guy finally scammed billions of ran. After a few years, he was secretly arrested and returned to China for trial. It doesn't matter whether this person is good or bad. What he does is right or wrong. The operation method and thinking of this economic criminal is absolutely amazing. There is also his courage. He does not have a penny in his hand. He relies on a mouth and him. The plan can lie to billions, it is a talent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just borrowed a small part of his entire plan, a small part of the empty glove white wolf, he does not intend to be a liar, nor intends to go into exile Abroad, so the plan behind it will not be carried out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting 1,700 pieces and a brand new letter of intent, Du Lin quickly found another four wine suppliers the next morning. This time is more reliable than the last time. After all, the agreement can't be faked. The above clearly shows the signature and address of the Moon brand agent in the city of Tyrol and Richard. Just ask someone to ask, you can know if this intention agreement is true, and no one dares to falsify on this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two suppliers who are unwilling to take too much risk and take the initiative to launch. There are still two suppliers from abroad who are holding and Richard. De the same mind, you have to bet on it. From their hands, Du Lin got a new letter of intent, and two other penalties for liquidated damages, plus just five thousand in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can five thousand pieces do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was thinking about this issue while thinking about the next job. Five thousand pieces can buy more than ten facades, and do a lifelong death and sleep. You can buy a big house, buy a car of the upper grade, and you can do a little business with a little money left. No matter which option, there are 5,000 pieces, this life basically does not need to consider a bad ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s five dollars! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was nervous soon, and Du Lin’s play was so big that the speed of his heartbeat was flying. That is a big business of 150,000 bottles! Add up to almost 100,000 yuan! But Du Lin has only 5,000 in his hand. What should I do? Do you want to run? Where did you go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked worried at Du Lin, so troublesome things, let the smart people think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf’s concerns are completely unreasonable fears in Doolin. Yes, he really has to buy 150,000 bottles a year. Wine does need almost 90,000 yuan. But this wine is not given to him at one time, and his money is not paid to the other party in one lump sum. To put it simply, as a big customer, he has every reason to pay a deposit of 10% of the total price of 10,000 bottles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these wines are sold out, the total amount of the 10,000 bottles is sold, and then the previous process is repeated, the deposit is paid again, and the sales are sold and sold. Check out after the end. His pressure on cash is very small. The deposit of 30,000 bottles of the three suppliers is not enough, but there are still 3,000 in his hand. What really needs him to spend his time and money is to find a place where he can store so many wines while still being able to carry out large-scale purification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a small iron pot to purify can not keep up with his speed, then it is necessary to ask the blacksmith to build a larger distillation equipment, at least a thousand Block around. There is also a warehouse factory that is concealed, remote, and not easily found, and has a certain degree of convenience in transportation to complete the change from low to high alcohol. It’s just a warehouse. It’s going to cost three or five hundred dollars a year, and with the modification, I’m afraid I won’t leave much money in the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these are not simple things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, Du Lin splits everything into a separate matter, handed it to Graf, let him bring Go with the members of the fellowship. And Du Lin himself registered another company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly registered "Ternel Leather Products (Package) Company" is only to prevent fraudulent means of using the money from the bank when the money is not enough. It is also possible to transfer property when needed, and he will not use the company easily, as a last resort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the teenagers in the fellowships constantly appearing on the street, they put on new clothes and pants, and put on pretty good shoes to attract A lot of curiosity of the same young people. The Guar people have a hard time. Everyone wants to wear new clothes and wants to fill their stomachs. Under the propaganda of these people, some young people have joined the fellowship. Two hundred pieces from Mr. Heidler were sent in about five days in advance, alleviating the embarrassing situation in which Du Lin’s funds were gradually reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It happened that the factory was also found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tnel is a Bentham city, and the suburbs are just a field of farmland and pastures. After Graf found a lot of places to be vetoed by Doolin, he simply ran outside the city to find a suitable venue, and he really let him discover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dilapidated ranch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of poor management, coupled with the wartime empire in order to suppress the skyrocketing food prices, a large number of beef cattle were officially acquired by the official and its low prices. The rancher who lost the money can only borrow some money from the society and buy the calf to raise it. I hope that the calf will be able to make up the lost money when he grows up. However, after two years, there was no slowdown, and people who kept collecting money came to the door. In the absence of a rancher, these creditors directly took the cattle in the ranch to offset the debt. There was originally a rancher who hoped to be able to turn over the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wicked creditors have already let go of their words. If they can’t return the money, they must sell the female members of his family to make people spend money. Where you buy music, the rancher who is unwilling to ruin the family can only sell his own ranch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cares about the pasture, the weeds in the ranch are soaring, many facilities and buildings are crumbling in the absence of maintenance, this broken scene makes some investment desires People are discouraged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buying a ranch and rebuilding it is obviously not the most suitable investment for investors who want to see benefits in the short term. It is better to buy wasteland directly and the price is cheaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dragged on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Graf came here with Dooling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s desolate!" Looking at the weeds with one person, Du Lin lamented that he was very satisfied when he saw this place. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a country road on the edge of the ranch. Although the road conditions are not so good, transportation is basically no problem. It is still very remote, surrounded by a small amount of farmland, that is, wasteland, pedestrians can not see one for a long time. In addition, because of the neglect of management, the grassland of the pasture is high. If the general person does not deliberately do anything, he will never come to this place and still go in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When distilling, there will be some escaping wine leaking out of the distiller. If the rich scent is not enough, it will cause trouble in densely populated areas. He has not even received the liquor license until now, and he must be arrested if he is reported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only trouble now is that the crumbling sheds are obviously unusable and must be rebuilt, which is an extra expense. Fortunately, Mr. Heidler’s second money arrived very timely, otherwise he would really use some unwillingness to use it to raise cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While along a trail to the rancher’s home, Du Lin asked: “How much does this guy owe? How much does he want to sell?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf said while opening the road ahead: "I heard that it is two thousand two hundred, and he offered three thousand."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin brows a little, except for other expenses plus the money given by Shanghai Deloi, there are almost 500 gaps, but the real calculation, this is a gap of one thousand. Because he can't give all the money and leave it, he must leave three or five hundred pieces as emergency funds. It is not a simple matter to get together a thousand pieces in a short time. You can only go first. One step, take a step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two, together with two members of the fellowship, visited the home of the rancher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door is a woman who looks like her thirties. She has a blond hair and a very distinctive Oding character. She is a good figure and looks good. It is no wonder that those creditors said that they would sell her to pay off debts. Such mature women, especially women with blonde hair, are most popular in entertainment venues. Ogden has some populism and looks down on other "failed races", so even in such a place of entertainment and women's negative distance contact, they will choose Ogiltin women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And other races are being bullied or hostile by the Ogildinians, and when they come to such a place, they will definitely choose Ogiltin women as their own ridiculous night. Object. It seems that when riding on them, they can alleviate the grievances and anger that are suffered in the weekdays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she has a daughter, I am afraid that this price will be reduced at least several times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman was alert and looked at the visitors outside through the door. Her eyes always stayed on Graf, and she subconsciously thought that if this group of people is a bad person, then Graf is the worst person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
