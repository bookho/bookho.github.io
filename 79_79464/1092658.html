			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, a guest has already appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news that Doolin came to the federation could not hold the high level of the two countries, especially on the federal side. It is indeed convenient for Mr. Kaile to say hello to Dulin’s visa-free entry. His trip, but also let some federal departments pay attention to this matter. This is exactly what Du Lin needs to do. The sneaky entry into the federation is not suitable for this action. He must let people know that he is here before he can attract some special guests to visit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the guests who can't wait to meet Du Lin today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can call me Mr. Jack...", the federal hot weather allowed Du Lin to wear short sleeves, but Mr. Jack was still dressed and dressed. Same as autumn and winter. Not only a flower collar shirt, but also a small vest and a decent dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two are walking slowly in the gardening of Doolin Manor, surrounded by the hands of Doolin and the federal Mr. Jack, to prevent anyone Listen to their conversations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took off his hat and owed a little, "The kingdom and the queen asked me to convey to you the apology about the last thing, they asked me to meet Dulin as much as possible." "Your request in the Federation!", said that he put the hat on, so that if a person walks on the street, it will definitely be considered a madman. What is even more strange is that he is bare on the skin outside the clothes. A little bit of sweat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Du Lin also found a funny and strange performance, this Mr. Jack and the Empire’s Mr. Jack’s facial muscles are as stiff as if Like an uncontrollable stone, and the face of Mr. Jack is not as true as it is, there is a layer of lifelike thin mask covering his face, covering his true face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said "the last thing" means that Dooling hopes that the poker organization can enter the insurance business with him, but the king believes that the poker organization is not suitable for intervention. Business. At first, Doolin was a bit strange. This organization has been working as an international black money circulation bookmaker. Every year, countless money is spent in various countries. They are greedy for money, but why should they reject a more profitable industry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, he gradually understood that the poker organization has always been a secret organization, and it may not be so secretive at the top of the country. For the whole society as a whole, there are not many people who know them. If they participate in the insurance business, it will be equal to the surface, and will expose the backbone of this organization. Many people are coveting the poker organization that does not know whether there is a "book" that does not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once they exposed themselves, it would lead to disaster, and after learning this, Du Lin would be relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How good is the money, you have to have a life to spend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and waved his hand. "I was smashed. I can understand the thoughts of the king and the queen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your understanding!", Mr. Jack once again sighed and greeted him. After standing up, they walked in an artistic garden art scene. "The King attaches great importance to this action and has already adjusted it." Less than 200 million stars, that is, 800 million federal shields to match you, in addition to some international hot money and funds are also very interested in your plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Du Lin slightly frowned. He hadn't said the doubt in his heart. Mr. Jack added immediately. "Of course, please rest assured that these people will not miss any news. They are all trustworthy people. It has been a long time since we worked with us, and the organization can guarantee that they will not do something stupid that should not be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If they did, Your losses will be fully compensated by the organization and will let those guys lie on your face. , let you dispose of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has more smiles on his face. If there are more financial resources to help him, his plan will have unlimited success rate. Improvement. Blocking a country's financial economic system is itself a risky thing, and failures can be high. With so many new partners, there will be additional risks in addition to the success rate, and the risk will be even less after the failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been very happy with you all the time. Since there are new people planning to enter, please give me a list, I will contact them one by one. "This is definitely an unexpected surprise. Du Lin is now full of energy and joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what I want to do!", Mr. Jack pulled out a folded list from his pocket with a name and a phone call, no Extra things like specific posts. Du Lin glanced at him and put it in his pocket. The two still walked forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Jack’s eyes were a bit complicated. He shook his head as he sighed and took another business card from his pocket and handed it to Doolin. “The kingdom and queen are very eager to communicate with you directly. This is what they asked me to hand over to Your personal contact information, starting today, you can directly cross our level and contact two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another surprise, Doolin After taking a look at the business card, I can see that it is the lowest-grade printing style. There is no pattern on the pure white card. The front reads “King” and a phone call, and the reverse says “Queen "And another call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s connection with these two big men is often conveyed by Mr. Jack, in one sentence without any modification, from different people. When you say it in your mouth, it often means something different. If the person who spoke a little has a slight sense of subjective emotion, it is possible that the meaning of this sentence is exactly the opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, "You are a female watch", let one person smile and beat another person's shoulder, the tone is filled with a kind of person who can listen When I came out with a non-malicious joke, I didn’t have any movements with a serious look. When I watched another person say this, it’s not a meaning to step on the horse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how neutral Mr. Jack’s position is, he can’t completely repeat Doolin’s tone and context, which will inevitably lead to unnecessary Misinterpretation and trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s much better to be able to contact the king and queen directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you very much, this is very important to me!", Du Lin put the business card in the business card holder for safekeeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jack waited for him to finish all of this before he continued, "Some senior executives think that you are coming here with a mission, from Now your phone will be monitored, and they will even secretly install gadgets in the place where you live. If you find some boxes that are 15 centimeters long and about seven or eight centimeters wide, it's best to dispose of them. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't say what it was, but Du Lin understood it all at once, it was definitely a listening device. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The federal technology has developed so well?" Du Lin’s sentence suddenly made Mr. Jack realize that Du Lin knew what it was, he I was more reassured, and then I nodded. Du Lin was curious. "How do they solve the problem of power supply and signal transmission?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Jack smiled and shook his head. "I don't know exactly how this works, but they often connect this thing to some hidden places that can be connected to wires, such as where the room has wiring. As for how it works. "Where to ask the scientists."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal level of technology is much higher than the Empire and farther than the Empire. They were the first countries to start skilled migration, and none of them. Adequate research funding and a desire for talent have led many scientists to the Confederacy, which is why half of the empire can't block the federal soldiers, and finally rely on the backward supply line to kill the Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interesting thing is that the final direction of the war was because the traffic of the empire was not good, so it was a shame for the federation to fail to replenish the front line and lose the war! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The superiority and advancement of federal military technology in this war completely crushed the armaments of the empire, resulting in the Empire’s constant investment in these years. The military’s expense in researching new weapons and adding dozens of grants to the Imperial Academy gradually bridged the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also thinks that the empire has a large number of spies on the federal side. This thing may be something that the individual cannot study and understand. It is not a problem to use a country's power to crack and copy it. Then the empire is also mastering this kind of thing. It seems necessary to have the fellow villagers and agents clean up their own territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jack and Du Lin have talked for a while, about Doolin’s security and how to leave the Union when necessary, Mr. Jack said he would arrange everything. it is good. This point, Du Lin still believes in him, can run such a large money laundering organization, and there is no one only his own door has long been a pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending Mr. Jack, Doolin made a phone call according to Mr. Jack’s list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin invited the gentleman to talk on the phone, the other party was pleased to invite, and after lunch, Du Lin saw this called ... The name reads a little bit different. This is a Mr. Amo Mao Aredtoya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Amo...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Du Lin’s open mouth without speaking At that time, the Mr. Amo Mao Ariedoya laughed loudly. "Many people can't read my name completely, so I hope that others will call me Toya, at least the name is simpler than the other one. More." He is a self-deprecating person and very flattering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
