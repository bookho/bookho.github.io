			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is not appetizing?", Du Lin looked up and saw that Albert, who had barely moved there, asked, he was playing in front of him. Bone stick, dig a spoonful of bone marrow into the lettuce leaves and put it directly into the mouth. When chewing, it seems to be able to hear the sound of fresh lettuce leaves being shredded. "It's a delicious way to eat if you don't try it." It’s really a very regrettable thing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one in this world’s upper class will wonder how to eat bone sticks, they will only eat one cow The best piece of meat on the body, this is the mission of a cow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the rest of the meat will be in different parts and grades, and finally into the middle class and the bottom of the community table, become a rare dinner. It’s funny that 90% of a cow’s meat is sold at a price that is sometimes not as good as that of a 10%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for other things, they tend to choose to make pet feed, or to land directly. People are not interested in water, things like bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no shortage of people to discover in the world, especially when one is poor, they may try to change their menus. One way to eat bone marrow is one of them. The mellow bone marrow floats on the surface of the roasting layer of butter with a mellow aroma. The real bone marrow oil is more fragrant, more mellow and more greasy. There is nothing more delicious than the food that can be bought for a few cents or a few cents, so that this method of eating gradually spreads at the bottom of society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People only need to go to the slaughterhouse to buy or lick some big bones, then throw them into the stove for heating, and then find a stone or hammer after the bone surface is burnt. You will be able to enjoy the satisfaction of the food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Doolin..., I have no appetite now, can I satisfy my curiosity?", he licked his lips and feared that he would not Any appetite, "Do you have anything that I need to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his finger, he was stunned again, this time without any The side dish is sprinkled with various ingredients and then directly wrapped into the mouth. The delicious bone marrow and more than ten kinds of well-prepared ingredients blasted on the taste buds for a moment, and the taste of the delicious to the extreme seems to be the most beautiful thing in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he tasted this rare taste, he wiped some greasy hands and looked at Albert like a smile. "Do you know what your biggest mistake is?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert snorted and then bowed his head. "I am sorry, Mr. Doolin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means he doesn't understand He made a mistake, but he must apologize for the mistakes he didn’t know. It seems that his attitude has no problems. But actually, on the first day of Doolin’s arrival, he can say that he’s out. problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat sideways and let himself and the table vacate some distance. He rolled his leg and put a cigarette on it. Someone around him put it for him. The lighter got in front of him. He took a sip and pressed his cigarette in his left hand against the back of the chair. He looked at Albert. "You used to say 'yes, boss', 'good, boss', now you shout I'm Mr. Doolin, I want to ask, are you ready to leave me alone? After you use my money, use my power, use everything on my own, cut my things and go Single?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his finger and pointed at him, "You are very courageous..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Albert was sweating for a moment. He just wanted to defend himself. When Mr. Doolin blurted out, Du Lin pointed at him again, and he closed his mouth subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before we talk, we have finished eating things. We want to thank Mr. Chef so late to come here for dinner for us. You can live up to me. Expectations, but you should not undermine the good intentions of others!", Doolin retracted his arm and looked at him, "Now, eat things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Du Lin smiled and nodded to the chef, the chef's mouth was closed and he could make a dinner for such a big man. He was enough to boast in the guar community of the Federation for a lifetime! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also gualts in the federation, but they are so much less than the empire, and some are sold as slaves after the dying of the guar dynasty. Some of the commercial alliances at that time came from escaping. These people have begun to take shape after a hundred years of reproduction. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albie rubbed his sweat while he ducked his head and scooped the spoon with a spoonful of scoop. He heard the badness in Doolin’s words. He must explain it as soon as possible, otherwise he may have a bad end. He didn't doubt that Du Lin dared to kill him. Du Lin had too many people to kill. Even if he is now the CEO of Pacific Group, he will not be in the eyes of Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching Albert quickly put the food into his mouth, picking up the wine glass from time to time to swallow the food, and coughing for a while, Du Lin's expression has never changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About ten minutes, when the last thing was swallowed up by Albert, he took a napkin and wiped his mouth and wiped his hand. Sit back straight up, "I have eaten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have not thanked the chef for the elaborate dinner for you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert immediately expressed his gratitude to the chef, "Very delicious dinner, thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin Nodded. "Hey, it’s not difficult to be a polite person. You can continue to talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boss, its..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just opened his head, and Du Lin interrupted him. "No, don't call me boss, call me Mr. Du Lin."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence made Albert’s scalp numb, he resisted the violent discomfort and shouted a word, “Mr. Doolin,” and then went on, “I’ve been following Your instructions are to preside over the work here, no Why is it against your place? I asked myself that I have not done anything that hurts your interests in the past few years. Maybe you misunderstood something, I can explain it clearly!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Buddha handed a document to Doolin, and Albert looked at the document. Unfortunately, Du Lin’s opening angle was completely against him. He could not see the documents. Any one letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked through the documents for a while and suddenly asked, "Where is Mr. Evan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mr. Ivan is Albert's mentor and an old salesman. He gave him a lot of help when Albert first started this trip, and taught him a lot of truth, just like in his life. The most important mentor. Later, he worked with Du Lin, and he did not forget Mr. Evan, who helped him the most, and invited him to join Dulin Investment, an important service held by Albert's registered service company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, Du Lin asked Albert to go to the federal side to carry out his plan - then Du Lin had not got rid of some negative reports, his power and hands. The power is not enough to make people ignore the essence of being a Guart, so the only person in his hands who is flexible and able to be independent is Albert, so he sent Albert to the Union. Host the work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Ivan and Albert, together, Mr. Doolin and Mr. Evan talked twice, knowing that this is a very ordinary, but also very intelligent person. He believes that with the precious qualities that Albert once possessed, and the cleverness of Mr. Evan, they are able to successfully complete their own requirements and support the stalls here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts also prove the ability of the two of them to cooperate, the success of Atlantic Group is an obvious proof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now, where are Mr. Evan? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert suddenly silenced, he did not dare to justify it casually, he did not know what Dulin’s documents were written, in case he Wrong, it will only lead to more troublesome consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Ivan started the Atlantic Group Company a year ago, not Albert kicked him out, but the two are carrying everyone To do one thing, they are quietly and sneaky to transfer assets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Ivan went to the Republic of Seriville, a small neutral country, did not establish diplomatic relations with any country, and did not reach extradition clauses with any country, in other words Said that it is a paradise for exiles. Many criminals who have made a fortune have been buried in the seclusion of Seriville. In the mouth of people, it is a paradise, a heaven! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenery is picturesque, the seasons are like spring, the tranquility is quiet, and it is most suitable for the elderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Du Lin can understand the changes of Albert and Evan. Anyone who suddenly holds a group company worth one billion market value will have a little thought and a little No one knows if you steal a little. This idea is not known to Albert, or Ivan came up with it. Ivan was appointed as the head of the overseas development department last year, and engaged in the expansion of overseas markets. Then the guy went to Saireville and registered. a company. Some of the funds of the Atlantic Group's overseas operations expansion have entered the company account of Seriville. What's more interesting is that Albert also signed a contract with the company that belongs to him and Ivan, and the Atlantic Group pays this year. The company of “Yuanyang” has a sum of money, and this small company has expanded its business channels in the Western China. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In more than a year, nearly 10 million federal shields have been paid to the small company as operating expenses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
