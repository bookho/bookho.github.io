			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are two who haven’t arrived yet, you will talk for a while." When Henry said this, Du Lin knew that Mr. Carlos must There is something to talk to myself, and I am very curious about Bondinka’s military group Du Lin. There are very few aristocratic members in this military industry group. Instead, ordinary people occupy a large part. The strangest thing is that they can also get a lot of military purchase orders. All this shows that the Bondika military group is at the top of the government, especially the Ministry of National Defense. There is a lot of energy in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every military purchase order represents tens of millions of arms trade, the Empire has a number of military industrial groups, why the Ministry of Defense has to buy Bundika ? It is nothing more than a selection of key people, perhaps from the Ministry of Defense management, or from the Imperial Army, in general, Carlos is a worthy person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two knew and Henry smiled, then walked into a side hall next to them, the maids gave them tea and After the snack, I left here and closed the door, leaving only two of them in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Doolin, we are all businessmen, so I think we should say something simpler, what do you think?", Carlos’s character looks like Very direct, he means there is no need to carry out too many temptations, what to say and what to say, preferably in a very direct way. But Du Lin thinks that he is definitely not such a direct person. The executive director of the military group like Bondika is not a straight. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He not only has to deal with the local working class, but also with the Western mines, and with the local state government, as well as the military and people from all walks of life, if he is really It is a straight-forward temper who may have died in a stinking ditch or has returned to his hometown to become an insignificant unemployed person. The reason why he can say this, perhaps... He has something in control that allows both parties to avoid unnecessary non-essential and direct topics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin picked his eyebrows. "It's good. I like this simple way of communication."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you have a lab?" Bundika’s first sentence reminds Du Lin of the incident that Stan Ein told him, and Bundika’s lawyer contacted him, hope A small patent in the lab can be purchased. However, Stan love refused to contact the other party and stated that the patent belongs to Doolin. If Doolin does not nod, no one can sell the patent to them, and in order to avoid some patents being stolen, Stan Ein and the laboratory The researchers built thick patent barriers for all patents, enough for anyone to see their headaches and then open their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling nodded. "Yes, you know that I am very interested in some fresh things, and some business needs some new things, so I set up a lab to serve me personally. Some people like money. Money has power, and I like some flashy gadgets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not a flashy gadget!" Carlos laughed. "I saw a special chemical formula called 'aluminothermic agent' from the patent office that can produce high heat of up to two thousand degrees. I am very interested in this formula. I don't know if I can sell it to me?" He laughed again. "I am very sincere. As long as you open a price, I can promise now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aluminothermic this thing Du Lin knew it. At the time, it caused an accident and almost caused the lab to catch fire. Although Du Lin felt that this thing was of no use at first, but in the spirit of "there is gold everywhere on the road of scientific research," he asked Stan Ein to register a patent and create a patent barrier, and he also told Stan. Ein, no matter what patent the invention invented, even if it seems to be useless, it must be registered patents, and patent barriers must be built. Stan Ein also performed Duolin's requirements very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this group of researchers who can already be called scientists, research, experimentation, destruction and manufacturing are their favorite pastimes, this is not what makes They feel irritated things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original patent formula that seems to be useless can attract a regional executive director like Carlos, so this is equivalent to telling Du Lin, that The recipe is very useful and very valuable. For the valuable thing, Du Lin’s attitude is in his own hands. One of the big dreams in his dreams had made him very confused. At that time, Daxie got a very important information, but he did not have any useful information for himself, and some people were willing to pay for this information at a high price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the normal person's thoughts, Daxie may take this information that is meaningless to him but important to others and sell it for a price, and then use it. Funds to develop their own power, but the result is exactly the opposite. I didn’t know anything about it, and even arranged people who knew it to work abroad. Until the day he died, the information was kept in his underground vault and was not discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, a good friend of Daxie asked him why he didn’t sell this information. The answer was very strange, but it made sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that if I sold this information to a certain group, they lost a sum of money in a short time, but after getting this information, they can speed up the development, and expand their own strength and power by leaps and bounds. Will develop a new potential enemy for me. At that time, I might have got a considerable amount of money, but I had a terrible opponent. It was better to destroy this information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I have lost a sum of money, but this money is not mine, and a group is in the future because of the lack of this opportunity. There is a possibility that I will lose my way, and I will not even match my shoes. I lost my fortune, but I also lost a potentially terrible enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a smart person, so I can only come up with such a stupid way, maybe right, maybe not right, who knows? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, Du Lin was also very confused. If Daxie got a considerable amount of wealth for development is not a better choice? But then he gradually understood that when a force develops to a certain extent, the importance of money is far less important in the early stages of a development. Yes, it looks good, but it is actually worthless. Because any force develops to the end and wants to continue to grow, the most needed things are often not pure money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This episode was very deep in Du Lin’s memory, because at that moment he chose the opposite of Daxie, and finally proved that he was wrong. A force that would have been very likely to catch up with the amnesty, because there is no support for intelligence, there is a continuous decision-making mistake, and it has since become an ordinary force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Du Lin has the same idea, the substance of the thermite may be worthless to him, even less meaningful than a toilet paper. But once this thing is sold to the Bondika military group represented by Carlos, it is highly probable that Carlos or Bondika Military Group can make great progress in weapons research and development, thus defeating several other military industrial groups and becoming a giant. A giant without a hegemony. At that time, the Bondikar Military Industry Group, where the money was too numerous, would spread out the tentacles, and after completing the supremacy of the industry like many monopoly groups, it began to invade other industries, and it was impossible to become a man with him. The enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not impossible. At the time, Mr. John George made several transformations during the most glorious period of the George family’s monopoly. Although it failed, it also told Du Lin, can not be underestimated the ambition of the capitalist in the heart of the industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
