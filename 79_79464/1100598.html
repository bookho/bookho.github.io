			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Alan Duyy said nothing, Du Lin has already vaguely guessed, he is a little angry, on the one hand from Alain Dui, he does not seem to Know who he is talking to. On the other hand, it was from Natiya. She looked at herself too lightly and also imagined that Du Lin was too bad. This is not a good thing. Of course, Du Lin forgot the original meal that he designed to dig Natiya, so that there was always a shadow in Natiya’s heart, and it has not been released until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan Duyy looked at Natiya a little coveted, beautiful young girl he had more knowledge, such as the two around him, but like Na Tia has such a very special temperament, just like... Yes, a woman with a warm temperament is rare, and she can refuse him. He likes it more. For Alan Duy, there has never been anything from his birth to the present that can stump him. In his worldview and values, the world has money to have everything, even if he says he wants to join the royal family. Dinner, Lutheran VII, the mixed ball should also seriously consider it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here, he tasted the shame and unwillingness of being rejected, especially when he took out the 500 million proof and the promissory note. This woman still refused his invitation and gave him a desire to conquer while angry. For him, there is nothing in the world that can't be bought. If you can't buy it, there is only one possibility, that is, you give too little money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan Duy smiled at Du Lin and didn’t care about other people’s emotions. “I will give you more money, 600 million, I don’t ask for a return. Rate, as long as it is reasonable, even if it is a loss, it doesn't matter. But you need to make..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the room was pushed open while the speaker was talking, the owner of the restaurant took it The chef placed a beautiful dish on the table. Just like the sashimi that Du Lin eats in that valley, every dish here is very delicate, beautifully placed, and more colorful in color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the restaurant is a bit strange. Generally speaking, at this time, the guests will be shocked by the knife craftsmanship of the restaurant chefs, and sincerely admire and admire, but This table... The two girls' eyes widened like they were caught on their necks and couldn't breathe. Another woman kept looking down at the table and what was falling? The two men are full of gunpowder. Are they really coming to eat? The boss has some doubts. If it is not Mr. Kaile who personally confesses that he must arrange it, don't worry about it, he really wants to say something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the waiter put everything in order, he did not introduce the raw materials and attention of each dish. He said “I wish everyone a happy meal” and left in a hurry. The atmosphere in the room was a bit strange, which made him very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door was closed again, the smile on Alan Duy’s face converges, and there is a feeling of laziness with an unbridled feeling. Ya has been with me for a while, and when you leave, the right to control the 600 million federal shields is yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two girls look at Nadia There are flames in my eyes. My goodness, that’s six hundred million. How many big movies can I shoot? They want to turn themselves into the old woman, and then put the money in the bag, even if it is placed in the bank to eat interest, the interest generated in one month is enough for them to squander for a long time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s face was full of playfulness. He glanced at Natiya, who was shaking, and then shook his head. “Mr. Alan Duy, you. It’s kidding me, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “No, Mr. Doolin, I’m never kidding!”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sighed. "It seems that we can't reach an agreement on this business. I am very sorry that Mr. Alan Duy, who has delayed your time, we will leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan Duy is a jerk, this is undoubted, but now is not a trouble, in the face of his more important big plan, he can tolerate the existence of this idiot, he will The king talked on the phone and told him how unfamiliar these people he knew. The two stood up and walked toward the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan Duy smiled. "There is a saying in our country, 'The knife can resist the enemy when it is outside, and it will hurt itself when it is inside.' Mr. Dooling, are you not careful to consider it?", he is threatening Du Lin, and it is the threat of red fruit to Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s footsteps, reaching out and pointing to the middle of the palm, asked, “Have you seen this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan Dui stared at Doolin’s palm for a few seconds and shook his head and said, “I haven’t seen anything.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You can look carefully, it is very special, you must have never seen it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence caused Alan Duy to have a bit of doubt. He blinked his eyes and stared at Doolin's palm to see it more carefully. For him, he and Dulin, who have certain identities, will not make tricks like the untouchables. Although some do not trust Doolin, they are not sure whether Du Lin is playing with him, but he is still curious. With. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze is locked in Doolin’s palm, then he looks at the palm of his hand and slowly raises it... slowly raises it... and then squats I slammed into his face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the room was shocked, and Natiya raised her head and looked at Du Lin with disbelief. Du Lin still maintained a gentle and polite appearance. The smile always stayed on his face. He picked up the napkin and wiped his hand, and looked at the red face of Alan Duy, shaking his head and said, "You are threatening a gentleman, Mr. Alan Duy, you may not know what you are doing, but I will let you Understand, my anger, you can't afford it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless Du Lin left for more than ten seconds, Alain Dui responded, he touched with shaking After touching the painful cheek, the whole person fell into a state of hysteria. "He dared to beat me, the monk actually dared to hit me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back After the manor, Du Lin glanced at Natiya, then went back to the study and picked up the phone, dialing the phone at the Irian Naval Base. When the operator knew that Mr. Doolin was calling, he immediately transferred the call to Major General Thomas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, I heard that you went to the federation, are you ready to pick me up? Or do you have anything that I need to bring back?", Thomas The tone is very relaxed, he has been proud of the recent spring, and by this time he is already half of the navy. The Ministry of Defence and the Navy signed a new secret plan. Although he didn't know all the content, he knew it was good news. To be precise, he was allowed to run his own "industry", but he must stand up when needed. Defend the integrity of national sovereignty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good thing, and many inconvenient things are exposed without any problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Du Lin’s words made him stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have heard that many pirates have recently attacked the trading ships of the Principality of Farolanco, so that they can not enter the high seas on a ship. This is a terrible thing. In order to ensure the safety of the empire's coastal defense and transportation lines, I personally donated 100 million to the Navy, hoping that the Navy can maintain the safety of the high seas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
