			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Eide suffocated a little bit in the wilderness, Kevin seemed to be relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the beach chair under the umbrella, he criticized the method of execution of Du Lin’s giving to Ed, while licking the frozen juice. Stimulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know that the time in the car accident seems to have become very, very slow? I always thought that the novels and movies presented to us were all artistic. The way, but I finally believe, at that moment seems to be very slow, I can even see a piece of paint debris drifting slowly from my eyes, but I can do nothing!", Kevin put down the cup and Doolin Speaking of how he felt when he was hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I watched the big truck with a row of lights hit my body, I saw the door being bumped in, I want Struggling, I want to leave, but my body can't keep up with my consciousness for that moment. I know, I may die... No, I will definitely die, I can't live under such an impact. It's damn At the time, my first thought was that if I couldn't get out, there would be something to fix me in my seat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to thank God, he responded to me. Although it may cost me to become a blind man in the future, he saved my life. The thing I want to do most now is to find a church after I recover, I want to be the lamb of God! "He said that he painted a cross on his chest. "Thank God, Almighty God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very sorry that I interrupted...", Du Lin waved his hand and the two young men walked toward Ed's body. They had to put him down. After finding a place to burn, you can't leave too much evidence. "If you believe in the old man of God, what about your devil's master? Everyone knows that you are the spokesperson of the devil, the devil on the soles of the feet. Believers.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin couldn’t help but smile. “That’s two different things. Do you know that faith has nothing to do with making money? Faith means that I have converted to God. He is an old man, this is the return of my spirit. And making money is the means for me to make a living. It is my pursuit of material. Can material be confused with the spirit?" He spread his hands and revealed a very regrettable expression. "Of course not Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I heard that if you convert to God, you can't do bad things, otherwise God will not only bless you, but will also lower. Punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin stunned. As a student who is good at learning and learning, he didn’t know much about these gods. He asked “Is there?” and then said nothing, “That’s it, I I feel that I still enjoy the happiness of reality. When I am about to finish, we are discussing the issue of faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the burning fire in the distance Shake the handle on the beach chair and put the beach chair flat. "Well, you can send me back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin makes people big trucks Start up and ask others while carrying Kevin. "What are you going to do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do? Of course revenge, I am The greatest lawyer of the empire almost died in my hometown. Do you know how angry I am now?! Rest assured, this time I will use legal and reasonable methods to let them know that they are murdering a lawyer. The key is that the lawyer still Without the consequences of being killed by them, I will let their family even have pants Can't afford to let them all hate what the two bastards are doing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many "incorrect" behaviors in this society that people take as Conventional unspoken rules are enforced. For example, the staff of the telegraph office installs the phone and does not need to pay any installation and use fees when they use it. They only need to buy a phone by themselves. For example, the employees in the movie theater and their family members do not want to watch movies, as long as they do not crowd out the position of those who buy tickets. For example, employees of the Electricity Bureau do not need to pay for electricity. They don’t need to pay money, they can also eat big ones in their own jurisdiction. In the era when the meter box is easy to handle, the electrician is a great Occupation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, some officials do not need to pay taxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government officials and military officers like Alex and Eide, they and their family relatives do not have to pay any penny of taxes, and To enjoy the benefits and policies brought by other taxpayers to pay taxes, there is no official tax in the imperial law. This will be very good for these people to lose even the pants can not be worn, the original tax is difficult to collect, especially this kind of powerful class, and they should be taxpayers, but now do not pay a penny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the SAT knows that it is going to match Kevin’s move, it will give the officials a wake-up call and tell them that it’s almost time to pay Money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending Kevin back to the ward to continue to recover, Du Lin left with the Buddha. Before leaving, Du Lin also asked the Buddha's own ideas. He did not want to stay here because it does not belong to him. The life of this time has fully made him realize the gap between himself and Vivian - too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he really got involved in Vivienne’s life, he didn’t know that before the meal, the chef would match a bowl of seemingly delicious lemon “soup”. Used to wash his hands, he thought it was for drinking. He still doesn't know that it takes more than an hour for two people to have a meal together. After adding up to twelve dishes, each dish will not be eaten. Sometimes he sees Vivian and only eats a small mouth, then The dish worth more than a dozen pieces was returned to the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes people will eat, sometimes they will fall directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every detail in life has an inexplicable sense of ritual, as if this life is the real aristocratic life, they live in the eyes of others, But the Buddha only wants to live by himself. A completely different world is barely put together. There is no second way to go except for the violent collision. Maybe he and Vivian are the strangers who are most familiar with each other, so that they can live together. As for the child, he will return to Vivian, but when the child needs to go to school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants his child to have a perfect childhood, instead of sitting in a room and letting a group of tutors slap him and tell him How should the hand be put, how much the mouth should be provoked, that is not what the child of this age should enjoy. Children of this age should climb in the mud and go home to be ass and flower, and climb up to challenge the fun of exploring nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Wei’an seems to know that this ending is good for both people. Besides saying goodbye, she did not retain the Buddha. Everyone has every Personal trajectories, now they should return to their own trajectories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Ordos’s big case? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has nothing to do with them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to Otis, Dudu expressed surprise at the time when he was absent, especially Colliers fell Things made Buddhism very surprised. "What if he is finished, what about our railway?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat on the sofa in the office of Doolin with fresh fruit, and the changes in the city were evident in both large and small details. When he and Du Lin came here, the apples were dry and had no water. It was estimated that they could be dried in the sun for a few days. But look at it now, these fruits can all be watered out, this is change, this is the new thing brought about by the development of the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am now responsible for the federal people, don't worry about this." Du Lin signed a document and approved the operation of urban public transportation. After Chester finished, Doolin could only choose among the other two finalists. Only his appetite has been raised by Chester, so he asked the city hall to have certain management rights and complete supervision. Although the two companies have given an unbearable attitude on the surface, they are all privately A new plan has come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin chose one of them to be a good-selling one and signed the word. After the other party got the approval of this document, they can start to operate this business. It may take half a month to see the new bus running on the road in Otis, but it is not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to explain the document after he closed it: "He left too many sites after Colliers fell, and he also lost against the federal merchants. The most powerful position, the people in the Federation want to come in, they definitely need a piece of 'work', even if the joint construction can not complete the project, there will be other federal people to actively support them to complete. On the capital, Obviously, those capitalists in the Federation are more aware of the rules and gameplay of capital games."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a bridgehead to open an industry, this railway plan will not make it anyway in any case. A piece of paper, even the federal government will take the initiative to help them, providing the most convenient conditions for them to enter this market. This is the strongest guarantee, they need a bridgehead to attack the empire, and Duolin needs a most favorable project, naturally they can cooperate together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For business and political things has never been the strength of the Buddha, Du Lin explained it casually, he said, and he asked another One thing, "I heard that Freena was sent to school by you?" He said that he suddenly wanted to laugh. Freena was two years older than Du Lin, one year older than Dudu, and now he still goes to school. When he thought of a group of young students sitting in an aunt, he couldn't help but get up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She needs to study to improve her ability. She is different from us. As long as we can get a gun and can pull the trigger, we will Ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
