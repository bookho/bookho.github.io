			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As a person living in this society, the primary task is to ensure that you and your family can survive in this society, so how to do this? Mr. Hersman smiled and said, "Work!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is getting bigger. "Only effective work can ensure that you have enough Survival necessities maintain the present life, but the job is limited, it is impossible for everyone to have a good job, some people take more money, then naturally someone will take less money. The first one facing the west The problem is the distribution of resources between the citizens of the country and the migrant population on the issue of employment. A large number of capitalists and entrepreneurs are loyal to giving less important jobs to the outside population because they have no union background and they need less salary. , taking on more work, which can reduce their expenses and save costs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly any business, the most is always that Unimportant jobs, repeated work with high physical exertion, no need for any culture and technology, or even a brain. Without any technical barriers, local people have fewer jobs and jobs. The migrant population is willing to lower their salary in exchange for job opportunities. This has also spurred some companies to change their salary structure. The salary they have paid for each position is almost the same as in previous years. There has been no major change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now these problems have not yet emerged. The main reason is the rapid development of the social economy. All walks of life require a large number of employees. The social market naturally uses these sources. It has been distributed and then flowed into various enterprises, but there are also some people who have nothing to do and are in a state of unemployment. Once these contradictions are highlighted, the whole society will inevitably have a huge storm, especially the working class. The organization of the workers’ unions is far more destructive than the external population.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second question, differences in living habits, human culture and religious beliefs make it difficult for immigrants to integrate into local life in a short period of time. For example, people in some countries do not eat lamb because of their beliefs. Or if you don't eat beef, they won't be recognized by the locals, nor will they recognize the locals, and they will not be able to integrate into the social environment. The nodes formed by too many different cultural contradictions are constructing an invisible wall, which will be the majority of the walls. The alien population is isolated and excluded from the social order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a short time, these people are still rushing for their livelihood, as long as they have Sufficient material foundation, and then there will be fierce conflicts due to various opposite habits and beliefs! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hellsman's tone is very "sharp". "When you are eating a steak, a group of people holding a protest sign circle around you, telling you that eating beef will go to hell. When a lady is wearing a skirt, she is naked. When the arms were walking on the street, a group of migrants on the way spoke to her and said that she was a woman who was not aware of shame..." Hellsmann shook his head. "Too many things will lead to social conflicts." And finally evolved into a conflict."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are not the same as the Federation. From the very beginning, the Federation has been constantly introducing foreign populations to fill the internal emptiness, for many years. Under the management of a large-scale fusion society that combines multiple cultural habits and religious beliefs, everyone can accurately find their own position, they know how to treat and face this society, so we can't see similar conflicts. Outbreaks. But in history, the federal government has also erupted more than once targeted social group incidents, all of which have extremely serious consequences. These are the empire that have not experienced it, but "What is going on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What we have to do, of course, is not a good enough policy to solve these problems as in the past, after all, we are no longer working for the royal family. Margots didn't look at us too!", a soft laughter in the room, Hersman grinned, not letting his expression be too exaggerated, although he thought, "Our work now. It is correct to guide these problems from silence to eruption, and then control the eruption conflict within an acceptable range, and then solve the problem, which is one of our next major tasks."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need you to develop a set of solutions, how to catalyze this process, how to ensure that we will be the ultimate beneficiaries, and that we can not only get the recognition of the locals, but also get it. Millions of immigrant votes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here here, Hellsman paused for a moment and began to sort out some of the documents on the table in front of him. He needs to give these people a Listen and understand Process solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for three or five minutes, he put the packed files together and looked up again to the participants. "Second thing, We need to find our competitors, and then figure out whether these enemies have flaws that can be attacked, and we also need to develop some programs to protect against attacks from the enemy." He looked at the two nobles," Collecting this information is a hassle. I hope that I can get these perfect news as soon as possible, whether it is true or not, I need it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing is too simple for the nobility. Many secrets in the eyes of ordinary people are not secret in the aristocracy. For example, everyone knows that Magus has pulled the splint for the emperor. They have their own sources of intelligence, and some nobles are happy to share what they know or to exchange some other information. This is the empire's top intelligence circle. If the unqualified person has more money and power, he will not enter the intelligence circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the terrible thing about the New Party and the Old Party. The election has not yet officially started. The information of many candidates will be placed on themselves and the enemy. The desk is for analysis. If you don't have this identity, you won't get so much information at all, and there won't be enough bastards to provide campaign services! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the core component of society! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all the tasks were arranged, Hellsman breathed a sigh of relief. He now feels that his state is better than ever, and he remembers working for the royal family when he was young. The sense of mission. Of course, there is a difference. It used to be glory. Now it is for money. The ghost knows why ordinary people are often able to win big prizes. He is such a distinguished guest who lost his pants in Otis, whether it is for money. Enjoy, or to maintain a decent life, this will be his most important thing in the next stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will announce the establishment of the campaign office and the news of your participation in the election. There will be a lot of reporters to interview, I will provide it to you tomorrow." A speech, as well as some plans to answer questions...", the news that Du Lin is going to stand for election is only spread in a small area, and it has not been officially announced. It takes time to prepare. Hellsmann is very Seriously, "If a reporter has raised some questions that you don't know how to answer, don't you say a word. Will someone solve these things and understand? Anything like 'inconvenient disclosure' can't be said!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, many journalists are bad guys, or there are always some naive politicians who are planted on this. They obviously have been claiming that they have nothing to do with themselves or simply don’t know. Why is it still involved in some inexplicable things? The reason is simple, they answered the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be a contradictory expression, but it is real. When the reporter asks a question, no matter how to answer, affirmative or negative Or the vague answer is actually affirming the problem itself. Affirming the problem itself, it means that the person answering the question is more or less likely to know and even participate in the matter of the problem. It is not a burden for reporters to write a few pens indiscriminately. At most, it is a public apology to express their uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
