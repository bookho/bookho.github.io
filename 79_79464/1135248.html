			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door that had just been pushed open was closed again, and Du Lin strode into the room. He glanced at the actress and tilted his head slightly. Go to the actress and ask her to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl took a look at Lucius, but the latter’s attention was on Du Lin’s body. How can I pay attention to a woman who has no value? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is very smart and immediately stands up, looking down at the people’s appearance, many things in the movie are fake, but not necessarily true Things, such as "You know too much" and "You saw my face." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the front is true, the back is fake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at the rich dishes on the table, and suddenly grabbed the tablecloth and waved all the food on the table, along with all the red wine. Fall to the ground. He walked into the table and pressed his hands on the table. He looked at Lucius with a blank expression and asked, "Who stole my money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp And Lucius, who had just been a successful figure in the upper class, shook his face with horror. He shook his head and said with a trembling voice, "Not me, I didn’t do that, you want Believe me, Mr. Doolin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is still the expression, "So tell me who stole my money!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest rule in the entire city of Otis is called the Law of Doolin, a game rule that Dulin personally sets, controls all the behaviors in the city, and fights against possible The external forces that emerged. Under this rule, the greatest power is not the mayor, but the shareholders of the seven major casinos, who can be the cornerstone of the construction of Doolin's law, and the tip of the Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the problem of the token company is only one part of the whole big problem, then obviously, there are absolutely seven major casino shareholders involved in the theft, just find That person can know what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucius is a shareholder of a casino, holding a total of 1.25 percent of the seven casinos in his hands, if disassembled separately Every casino has even less than one percent of its equity. Hundreds of such people have become the strongest part of Doolin's law, because no one has any power, including the government can take all the shareholders of all casinos at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the problem is at the shareholder level. The strong castle is always opened from the inside, and some shareholders have already rotted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucius is not the most famous of the shareholders, but it is best to master, so he is the first goal that Du Lin is looking for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now facing Du Lin’s inquiry, Lucius is sweating and the weather is already cold, but he is still sweating and his lips are shaking slightly, but Did not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that the problem is definitely not light, otherwise Lucius will not fight Du Lin for one or two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took back an aggressive stance and turned to sit opposite Lucius, who came over from behind and walked to Lucius On the side of him, he pressed his arm to the table and forced him to separate his fingers. Then he pulled out a standard saber and pressed it on the root of the little finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" Lucius struggled with fear, but soon on a cold metal-like little thing on his head. At that moment, I gave up the struggle and became honest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head. "Now tell me that you can not only keep your fingers, but also keep your life. But if you don't cooperate, you will Throw away all the extra things in your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ear? Nose? Lips? Fingers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Maybe include hands and legs, and life, if you are willing to continue to live in that way, I support you to close your mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin After only five seconds of speaking, Savi’s wrist was hard, and the sharp blade barely stagnated and cut off Lucius’s little finger. He just had to make a sound, and he was shackled by Savi. On the mouth, full of blood and sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his arm and pointed to Lucius. "You guys stole my money, and now I want to unite and let me know." Then, isn't the next step to prepare my power from the city of Otis, and then you come to be the master?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, very good, very good! Then don't blame me for sending your family to the reunion of heaven!", Du Lin said, after a table was up, Savi stood and stood behind Lucius, and he held Lucius's neck with his hand. The knife was ready to cut his throat, and when he felt that he was about to die, he patted the table and used all his strength to send the weak voice out of the blocked vocal cords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
