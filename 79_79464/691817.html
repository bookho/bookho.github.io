			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was very touched, but I was a little bit angry by you!" Du Lin shrugged out from the grass and glared at him. The smoke, swaying some arrogant hair, the new friends who joined the fellowships were curious to look at these "legendary" amnesties, one by one excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the dark ruins after the fire, a gust of wind can raise some Mars, and Du Lin grabbed the root from the Buddha’s mouth. The cigarette, took a deep breath. He looks calm on the surface, but the inner anger is like the thunderstorm of the sky at the end of the world, arrogantly wanting to vent something to the surroundings. Here are his plans for the future, his dreams for the future, but today, it's all gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know if the guy who wants to kill him knows if his technique wants to be captured, or simply thinks that he is in the way, so he has to get rid of him. . But this has nothing to do with everything here. It’s a bit off, here is the egg, and of course he knows that the fire must be Alice’s point. He has passed through Ellis. If he feels that the farm can’t keep it, he will destroy all the equipment and burn it here. Let those mixed balls go to a pile of molten iron to find technology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he really saw it happen to his eyes, why was it so distressing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sigh of sigh, why? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I just want to be an ordinary businessman so hard, why do I not want to hurt others but always hurt by others? He thought about the process of these four months, and the scene of the movie flashed in front of him. He couldn't help but laughed. "Alice is right, we were punched, so we can hold it. It is not my character to eat, but everyone hurts us." The people have to pay for it, I swear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, a strange thing happened, and Du Lin, who was alive and dead, actually appeared. However, he also took the initiative to go to the regional prison to serve his sentence. When the news was sent back to Turner again, it was not as much affected as the news that Du Lin was misrepresented. Just not dead, he can't turn over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost everyone thinks that the farm is burned, the Oriental Star trade line on Queen Street is beaten, and the deposit of the Imperial Central Bank is also due to Issues such as "criminal groups" were temporarily frozen and he could not turn over. Even if he can live out of prison, he can't turn over. If he is not smart enough to choose to disappear, the day he is released from prison is the day he returns to dust and earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you choose to go to jail after you leave? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo asked him this question. Du Lin’s explanation to him was very simple. The more people think that he is dead, the more he will look for evidence. Prove that he is really dead. But there is no doubt that they can't find evidence to prove that Du Lin is dead, which means that the behind-the-scenes black hand can't wait to find him and kill him to completely eliminate the trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin didn’t want to leave the city, not because he earned the first pot of gold here, nor did he fall in love with the city, just him If you feel that you have fallen here, then you should get back here again. Even if he is willing to bow to his fate and is willing to leave, where can he go? The entire Kanles is basically within the control of the old party. The New Party does not like the merchants who make profits through less legal means, or leave Cannes to go further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restarting in a place where no one knows him and is more prosperous... can he do it? He may not be able to do it. He has already learned some information about the "outside world" in the expansion of the private liquor trade. In the larger cities that are more prosperous and closer to the coastline, it is difficult for outsiders to survive. He doesn't think that he can do everything in the city of Tener in the past, maybe he will eventually become a tramp, or he may die in a dispute arising from a business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does they give Du Lin two choices? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get out of the city, or bury in the city, Doolin chooses the third, he wants to send those people in the city hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the prison that was originally full of crises became a safe place. Because Du Lin believes that no one will be more willing to bribe the warden, a trivial role in society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three thousand, this is the only money that Du Lin can now come up with. He gave the warden once and made it with the warden. A transaction. In the four-month sentence, the warden protects his safety, so the warden can not only get 3,000, but the family can be safe. If the warden receives the money but does not do what he should do, then the prison is not only the prisoner's prison, but also the prison governor's prison, and he will spend the rest of his life alone. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four months is enough for him to tell who is behind his idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take off the clothes naked and after a simple disinfection, put on a new torture suit. In the process, someone wanted to use Duolin's manual foot, but the guy accidentally "slid" a bit, fell, and lost a few incisors while the ears also torn more than half, those malicious eyes Only have reservations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think it's up to me to do it!", and all of them sighed and sighed, swaying his hair. For those prisoners with longer sentences, they are full of eager eyes. It is not the first time that Buddha has felt it. He has already come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged and took a quilt from the administrator's window and walked into the prison. The prison area is like a cage in the backyard of the Te Nil Regional Police Station. A larger cage, a group of people walking, is introduced to him on the side of the Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least 300 prisoners are held here all year round. Not only the prisoners in the city of Tener will be kept here, but prisoners in nearby places will also be held here. . It used to be a military fortress against the invasion, resisting the EFF that invaded from the direction of Tyne. After the war, it was transformed into a prison. For the sake of the war, gang activists liked to call it the “front line”. Those who were relatively positive were called the Ternell prison. In fact, the full name here is called "Kales No. 1 Prison", because it is gradually confused into the Te Nil District Prison near Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prison here is divided into the ordinary prison area and the heavy prison area. There are about 200 people in front and only thirty or fifty people in the back. Heavy offenders basically have no hope of going out in this life, so they are also the most fierce and ferocious group in prison, and they are very united, and few people are willing to clash with them. The composition of the guys in the general prison is complex and conflicts often break out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people divide the sphere of influence by race and region. No matter how they are divided, the Guar and the city of Tegel are the least in prison. I have to say that the rules of the game made by the mayor of the city have played a key role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before passing through a prisonhouse like a dove cage, people are constantly whistling and making inferior or provocative actions. There was a strong guy who even took off his trousers, revealed his own bird and stretched out from the iron fence door of the prison, and squatted at Du Lin and Dufo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the kid over there, come to me at night, do you understand?" His smile is annoying. "I will love you so much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The whistle around them screamed and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stopped and looked at him, and the next moment he made an action that no one else could think of. He quickly took off the bird that wrapped his hand in the hand and grabbed the guy. He slammed hard outside, and the face of the guy's smirk suddenly showed a look of horror. He pleaded and begged for mercy, and even if the strong man was taken to the point, he had to choose to compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does your bird turn?", Du Lin calmly flipped his wrist, the strong brawny made a scream, and the prison guard in the distance I found out that the situation here also ran over. Du Lin pulled it again, then released his hand and stood aside. As for the criminal service? He doesn't want it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing? Let me see your hands lifted up!" The prison guard waved his baton and beat the iron gate. Du Lin raised his face with his hands. It doesn't matter, the guy who is in the nurse's house is lying on the ground, crying with his dying bird and screaming. The prison guard only observed what was happening at a glance. In fact, there are many thorns in the prison, but the spurs that are "jumping" outside will become a lamb when facing the prison guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the prison guard was ready to teach the rules in Doolin’s prison with his baton in his hand, his eyes met Du Lin’s gaze, ready to wave The batons fell back on the iron gate of the prison. "Take your things and immediately return them to your room. If you haven't returned to the room when you name, I will apply to punish you!" He left a little embarrassed, and at the moment he looked at Du Lin, he faintly felt a message from the other's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he does, he may be injured or even die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the guy’s eyes he didn’t see any fear at all, only the thick killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin snorted and walked to the last room in Zone A on the second floor of the General War Zone, a room for six people. The original prisoners who tried to intimidate this way to get fun closed their mouths. Whoever is a monk, who is not a monk, can see it. Some people can only go out in a year or two or even half a year. There is no need to make unwise choices at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
