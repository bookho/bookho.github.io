			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment Du Lin appeared, Fei Lijia knew that the derailment of the train must have an unshirkable relationship with Du Lin - he came in person, this is the reason, that is It was the reason why Fei Lijia made a judgment, and Du Lin came in person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago she sent Du Lin on behalf of the entire Otis chip to her, and there is no doubt that this slap is very loud. You gave me what you think is precious, and I gave you the most precious things. This kind of quiet shame is enough to make any gentleman change color, but Doolin does not. If he is not already able to face any situation calmly, then he has his own ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is unlikely, otherwise there will be no friction between him and Vitor including himself at the dinner party, then only this latter guess is closer to reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must have wanted revenge, so he would not "remind" her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between the two is not good at all. Under the freezing point, Du Lin will be very happy if she knows that she is in the wild, it is impossible to personally Come here, these accompanying rescuers may also arrive until the evening is colder. Even if he comes, it is a joke, and it will not appear on its own initiative. This does not meet the consistent and savvy image in Du Lin's materials. Not only can jokes not get any substantial benefits, but they will let each other The relationship is even worse, why bother? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after analyzing all the possibilities at that moment, the only thing left is that Du Lin succeeded. He successfully retaliated against himself, so he appeared in Here, then shake hands with yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feilijia guessed a bit better, he told Fertica in this way, he is not afraid of anyone, any power, whether it is her, Or the Fatima family, he is not afraid. At the same time, he is not willing to fight with the big family, so he appeared here with his own personal purpose, the purpose is to shake hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the people in Otis knew that Ferry’s train derailed, the first thought was that Du Lin’s hands and feet, no one in this land. Can escape Doolin. So Du Lin found enough face, so that the fate of the Fatima family's heirs almost "car accident" is definitely not the gang leader and capitalist dare to do, for them, this behavior is no different from finding death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did it. The face that was lost before was not only found back, but also made them feel fear. This is a fearless man, no matter who his opponent is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin reached out and asked after the two released their hands. "I think Miss Felicia must be groomed, just as I am prepared."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felica has determined her own thoughts. At this time, she has completely abandoned the misunderstanding between her and Du Lin. This is true for her and her family. significance. It is said that when the Orientals came to this land, they left a lot of words that condensed the wisdom, and one of them was called "Harmony is expensive." She tapped her head and stood on the side of Doolin with a skirt and walked to the truck behind the truck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two trucks that accompanied this time were loaded with something that seemed meaningless, one of which contained a lot of water and a bathtub. The problem of heating is not complicated, and water can be scalded anywhere in the presence of twins and catalysts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ladder, boarded the truck, and Felicia pulled the cloth after thanking Du Lin, and she really needed to wash it. This damn place is very windy, and there is a lot of dust on the short-term kung fu, which makes the consistently clean Fei Lijia very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Ferrari’s bath, some workers had taken a pure white tent from the second truck, as well as a table and two chair. In addition to this, there are some fresh ingredients and kitchen utensils, and two quite famous cooks have begun to make dishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than half an hour of bathing, she changed her clothes out of the truck, and the glaring smile began to appear again, and people couldn’t help but always think. To look at her smile, it seems that only in this way is it more comfortable in my heart, I believe that there is really beauty and goodness in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contradictions have been resolved, then the next step is to talk about the things that the two people did not talk about in the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official statement of Felicia to Otis is tourism, but her identity and status, it is impossible to have time to travel. Whoever saw Magus did not find a place to spend his time, and it was ten days to go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of Ferrari is to first examine whether the only SAR in the city of Otis can bring the wealth and influence of the family to a higher level, and secondly if the development of the city of Otis is very successful, then the Fatima family and Du There is some cooperation between the forests to negotiate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I smell the scent...", Fei Lijia couldn't help but look at the other side after stepping on the ground again. "You think it's too thoughtful." I don't know how to thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled very brightly. "As long as you don't remember me, then it's all worth it." Under Dolin’s invitation, the two entered the small tent and sat on both sides of the table. The sterling silver candle base and the pure white candle and tent are very close in color, with a very pure and sacred feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside cooks are handling the food, and the two talked first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard a message that the Prime Minister, Prime Minister Magus, intends to build three more special zones, and the family intends to extend the business from the north to the south. You know The culture atmosphere in the north and the south is completely different. Therefore, before the formal construction, we hope that we can have a Southern designer who has experience in the construction of the SAR to help us. This is also the main purpose of my visit to the city of Otis." Ritz-Car did not hide her purpose at all and said it directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, don’t say, I’ll say later, if I talk about it later, there will be some problems with each other’s cooperation. There are always some people in the world who will feel Everyone must harm him and deceive him. Du Lin may not be such a person, but in case he is thinking about it? Therefore, in order to achieve stable and sustainable development of future cooperation, some words should be placed in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. He knew this thing. When he went to the emperor last time, Magus personally said to him, "So you know these SARs." Where will it be arranged, and what is the core development?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Otis is classified as a SAR, which is actually a cheaper, with the wrong information. The gaps in the world have crushed some of the inherent ideas of the world. In addition, the city of Otis was a barren land at that time. He did not lose this empire and would not lose anything, but doing it well means that the empire will have a huge harvest. Therefore, Harry and Magus will be very determined to support him to build the city of Otis according to his own ideas. If there is already a similar SAR before this, they will never agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will increase many artificial requirements, such as the development of a local characteristic economy, to distinguish between different SARs that do not have highly repetitive elements in economic construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felica nodded. "We are only clarifying one. The Cabinet’s appendix to the 'Monetary Memorandum of Understanding' signed with the Federation last month is Regarding one of import and export trade, 23 commodities will be bilaterally restored to the normal tariff system, so everyone agrees that at least one special zone should be in the south and in the border with the federal government."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not say Woodland, but she did not need to say that Du Lin was a Southerner, and he immediately thought of the state of Woodland that had not been held for a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Civil War, the Federation took only three days and a few hours to fully occupy Woodland, where there was no effective resistance at all, let alone Organized an effective counterattack. After the rapid capture of Woodland, the Federation realized that the illusion of the imperial power in the empire, from the original local war, directly turned into a war of extermination, and finally won almost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war, if you want to ask the most federal people in the empire, then most people will tell you, Woodland. After the federals took away the tariff rights of the empire, they placed the almost primitive market directly in the hands of the federal capital forces that had been freely evolving and evolved for hundreds of years. It is conceivable that these large and small businessmen plundered the wealth of the empire. It is bound to be the first to enter the empire, to find what is the most profitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most remote places in the empire of the empire have federal wine merchants, showing how the state of Woodland has become what these years have become. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin affirmed Fei Lijia’s guess. If there is a special zone for import and export, then it is obviously the most appropriate place in Woodland. The only question now is whether the SAR is re-constructed from scratch or on the basis of existing cities. This is crucial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cook put the prepared dishes on the dining car and pushed in. I don’t know who said it, Du Lin heard this in a dream-- Have a sense of ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the table was full of dishes, there were only two people left in the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
