			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Doolin, very eager to ask, are you buying a ship for the transportation industry?", this guy who is talking is called Hollis, he and Du Lin had a side, and the house where Du Lin lived now was built by Hollis. This guy is a standard real estate agent. It is said that he has won two major projects in the project in the eighth district, and his financial strength is eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked this question, but also wanted to know if Du Lin had any way to make money. At the luncheon meeting, Du Lin’s words had already begun in the upper class of Irian. Widespread circulation in the group, many people think that Du Lin's assessment of the future is very correct. When the economy of the empire began to recover, the first to be affected by the radiation was the physical industry. When people start to have surplus money in their hands, the first thing they need to do is to add something to the family, from a piece of clothing to an electrical appliance, or even to buy a house. So in the next decade, the physical industry will have a booming development period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to get recognition from many people naturally shows that Doolin is still capable, so he suddenly proposed to buy a ship and immediately caught the attention of Hollis. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked down at the card in his hand and threw the card back to the discard area. He lost the game and he paid five for it. Hundreds of chips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin leaned back on the back of the chair and nodded with a glass of wine. "As I said at noon, the physical industry will have A good period of continuous development, in which a large number of commodities need to be circulated, the empire now has only two circulation routes, steam locomotives and shipping." He took a sip of wine and watched Alexander stack the chips in the public area on the table. After standing up in front of himself, he continued: "The steam locomotive is under the supervision of the Empire. If we don't build the railway ourselves, we must abide by the relevant laws and regulations, and the more things we transport, the more the cost. High."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dealer shuffled, everyone’s attention was focused on Doolin’s body. He lowered the glass and raised his legs. “But the sea Not the same, I have never heard of the strict regulations on shipping. As long as they don't transport contraband, they can't control how we run. Plus the cost of shipping is significantly lower than the land transport, so I plan to apply for a transportation company. Engaged in maritime transport business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what about car transport?", Hollis talked about a recent new truck, a truck in the traditional concept It is more advantageous, bigger, and has excellent cargo and transportation capabilities. The new trucks are five to ten times more transportable than those used to be trucks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin snorted and took the card that the dealer sent him to his hand and glanced at it. He lost a 50-piece chip. "Truck ground transportation is the future trend, but not now. Trucks have the benefits of trucks. Compared to the inland lack of water resources, trucks can go anywhere, but you have to understand that economic recovery does not mean a major outbreak. This is a continuous process. In this process, the city that clearly reflects the economic recovery is the first to manifest itself. There may be only two to three in each state, and it is difficult to see profits in the short term by trucks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence makes Hollis nod again, Most of the richest places in every state in the empire are now the capital of each state. It is not good to go down. By then shipping these goods by sea to the nearest port to unload, and then to the place by steam locomotive, will undoubtedly save a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you plan to do this, are you willing to accept the investment?", Hollis directly throws the card back into the discarding zone, staring at it. Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin frowned, sweeping out five hundred chips and throwing them into the public area and laughing: "Why not?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afternoon game continued until 10 o'clock in the evening. A group of rich people put on their casual clothes and went to the bar for a while before they went home. Du Lin got up late in the morning. The plan to find Garfield was also delayed. As Du Lin expected, playing cards is not the key. The key is whether there is any information exchange. Everyone has not closed because of a new Du Lin who has joined this small circle. They share their own. Some news, I hope to find business opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature in the fall of Irian has begun to decline, only a few days apart, there is a significant drop in the number of visitors on the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if there was any problem with Doolin’s conversation with Nasha. I originally planned to visit Ilyan to discuss cooperation matters in the middle of the month. The group delayed the date by two weeks, which means that they may not be able to come to Ilyan at the end of the month to discuss how to cooperate and how to distribute power. This gave Juan a sigh of relief. He had already said that the biggest farmer couple in the next state had let them put all the money in their pockets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way he has more money to expand his "chips" as soon as possible, so that he is well prepared for the negotiations at the end of the month, so that he is Ignore the problem of construction in the eighth district until Scott came to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eighth district is the top priority in the next urban development of the Irian region. It can be said that the city hall has placed its political achievements in the next four years on the eighth district. They do not allow the construction of the eighth district. Any leaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Juan saw Scott, he realized that he had fallen behind. After asking about the progress of the eighth district, he was somewhat confused. Said that in his estimate of Du Lin's financial strength, Du Lin should have no funds to continue to build his project in the eighth district, but now Du Lin's construction site has started, where does he come from? Then he had a new speculation. Perhaps Du Lin introduced Luke's six million funds because he was unwilling to give up his project in the eighth district, so there was a shortage of funds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, Juan smiled and shook his head. It was a young man, he wanted everything, but he didn’t understand that he might not get anything at the end. Perhaps let him fall, it is the most powerful care for his growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Huan, there is a clear provision in the 8th District Tender Agreement signed between you and the City Hall, if you are not able to start the construction for three months Start building your project, you will permanently lose your power, do you understand that?", Scott took out the rubbish of the agreement at the time and placed it on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Hall has signed an agreement with all bidders in order to ensure that there will be no construction delays in the 8th district. The City Hall will take back their projects, build them themselves or hand them over to others for construction. This is the protection of the construction of the eighth district. At that time, everyone agreed, otherwise it is impossible to sign the agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan just glanced at the name he signed and pushed the document away. "Sorry Mr. Scott, the liquidity in my hands has been used." In the infrastructure of the new company, the shopping mall project in the eighth district may not be able to get enough money for the subsequent construction work, so...", he showed a very regrettable expression, "I can only say one sentence, I quit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott picked a eyebrow, and Juan’s recent economic situation has a speculation that he and Du Lin are like the same. Constantly putting funds into the new industry makes people feel scared. If they don’t see the return money and have no foreseeable return, they dare to pick up their belongings. I don’t know if Juan is crazy, or should he say that he has already Silly. Scott didn't persuade anything about it. After all, the bidding project in the 8th district is also a game of saving money. When you don't have money, you don't need to take the initiative to explain that you can't play, and the organizer will send you away. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
