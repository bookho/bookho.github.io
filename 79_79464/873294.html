			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coles quietly looked at Doolin after he finished, waiting for Du Lin’s answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought after a while and said: "Fifty years is too long, twenty-five years!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collys did not have any unpleasantness because of Doolin’s bargaining on the issue of time. He took the initiative and reached out, and Du Lin also extended his hand, “Real!” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reaching the intention, Colliers was very happy. He took out three pieces of music from his arms to Harry and Doolin, and took out a pure one. The gold-handed scissors, after cutting the mouth, took a breath, and the smile on his face seemed to be a bit brilliant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bit of a bad thing, that is, after smoking, people will relax, as if nothing is irrelevant, and nothing is in the heart. However, it is because of the strange effect of the land, so some people are willing to buy this thing, and it is still a big price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s clear that Harry and Colliers have a strong resistance, and they are not completely softened. Du Lin is only slightly sucked a little. I just kept it in my hand and did not continue to send it to my mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My son has a birthday after a while, you must come when you arrive!", Colliers is very satisfied with this cooperation, he got what he needs Naturally, I will not forget what Du Lin has done in this matter. "I will give you a good thing when I arrive!" This is the so-called "transaction." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colliers needs to contact his men immediately to start the operation, first leave, and after closing the door, Harry smiles and shakes his head. "He is This habit, once it is settled, will be operated immediately, but twenty-five years...", Harry slightly looked down for a moment, "Some is too long!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Harry and Doolin know that Colliers's purpose is to operate for twenty-five years. In addition to the economic benefits, the most important thing is the right to speak. After the construction of these two railways in the future, who can walk from here, who can not go from here, he has the final say. In this long period of twenty-five years, he was able to crowd out other capitalists who were not in his circle in this way, and thus gained political influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in the end, the battle between the capitalist camps is actually not very much related to ordinary people, and only benefits, no harm. First of all, with the railway, the traffic becomes more smooth, and you can reach other cities without transferring the car. Secondly, as the traffic situation gets better, more and more businessmen will gather here to increase the prosperity of the city. Become the real pearl of the imperial heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Hall only needs to pay a little bit of money each month to get two unobstructed railways, and the speed of currency printing will only increase with the recovery of the Empire economy. Faster and faster, the purchasing power of the existing currency denomination will gradually decline. It may be that the "mortgage" of more than 100,000 a month after 10 years is not as good as the purchasing power of 20,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the right to operate, this thing does not really make much sense to the official. No matter who Colliers allows, whoever is allowed to leave, there will be The train passes by here, and that's it. The frequency and attribution of trains can't restrict the passage of ordinary people and the passage of merchants. The pursuit of the right to operate is not of practical value for Du Lin and City Hall except for the good looks on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Du Lin believes that more than 10 million is absolutely impossible to do, it may be beneficial, and the benefits are many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I don't interfere with this, except for taking Cole, there is another thing you should pay attention to.", Harri Sitting next to Du Lin, he patted the deputy of the dilapidated sofa. "We will start voting at the end of the month. The city of Otis also needs to vote for a valuable vote."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the unified calibre. In fact, the old party seems to have been defeated by the New Party on the ground. In fact, the old party still controlled a lot of areas. If the mid-term election is overturned, it will definitely Become a joke remembered by history. Harry knows that the city of Otis is a war zone without a position. No position does not mean that these people will not vote. In case there are people in the old party connected in private, there is a high probability that there will be an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way he came, he didn’t see the campaign posters on the streets, so he gave me some notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and said, he followed and asked, "Can we win?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Harry is very satisfied with the word "we" used by Du Lin, which shows that he has recognized himself and Magus and the New Party and is willing to stand with them. The so-called politics is not to turn "you" into "us"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his chin slightly and said in a confident tone: "Of course, we won!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin has not much in this regard. Concerned that in the George family’s survey of campaign support ratings last week, Magus’s support rate exceeded 70%. According to experts, this may be directly related to the economic recovery of the empire. They are all sighing horses. Gus met a good time. After the war, the trough has passed, and the economic problems of the empire have begun to pick up. Naturally, the economy will recover. Some experts believe that even if the old party is in power, it will receive a high rate of support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They use the phrase "good luck" to describe the situation that Maggs is facing now. In fact, this is just a way to cover up the real problem, in their advocacy of peace and prosperity. Under the surface, the fierce contradiction is more serious than people think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic recovery of the empire did not come from the ruling idea of ​​the New Party, but from the invasion of all aspects of society by a large number of capital forces. The new party’s lack of funds after it came to power was the money, so they let go of the dog chain that lingered on the neck of the capital, letting the capital Sahuan begin to bite the stubborn economy. Capital has indeed brought about tremendous changes in society. As long as the merchants who pursue the interests are profitable, they will be involved in all walks of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these actions will create a large number of jobs, solve the employment of the imperial citizens and the problem of food and clothing, but the power behind the capital is not satisfied with the status quo, and began to invade politics. system. When the New Party was prepared to restrict the power of capital, it was discovered that the dog had already been able to fly from one foot and quickly evolved into a Tyrannosaurus Rex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this empire is really like the world in which people lived in the past, but the competition between the two great forces is heating up. Especially when the politicians of the New Party and the Old Party also appeared behind the support of capitalists and capital forces, finally the high-level leaders of both parties found that the big things were not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time I want to change, it’s too late! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incorporating capital into a cage will only cause social unrest, and a large number of unemployed people will become the trigger for turmoil and even civil war, and may eventually erupt. The Second Civil War, so everyone is in a limited confrontation, but the situation is absolutely not optimistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in this mid-term election, too many capital forces are involved, including the posters that Harry just mentioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Propaganda is cost, where does the cost come from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new party certainly does not have such huge financial resources to carry out propaganda work and public opinion offensives throughout the empire. The money actually comes from the capitalists and the money in their hands. They support Magus to continue his re-election, then Magus must give them enough rewards, otherwise they will transfer the camp to the old party. Capitalists have changed their camps, and those workers who rely on them to pay their salaries must also follow the transfer camp, which will lose a lot of votes and even lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it helped these capitalists, their greedy appetite became more and more difficult to fill, and they could only make concessions in time and again, so that they would retreat. In the last line of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the so-called optimism is just a modification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new party and the old party’s top executives have long felt this crisis. The battle between the old and the new aristocrats is likely to eventually evolve into a The confrontation of capital power. Perhaps ten or twenty years later, the election is no longer to see who has a higher level of governance, who is more brilliant, but who is more rich! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin whispered a few words, and Harry lifted his wrist and looked at the watch. "I still have something to go to the Imperial City tomorrow, I will not be here with you." , when can I call me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood up to send him, but he waved his hand, "I will go on my own, you are busy with you." "Things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After watching Harry leave, Du Lin sat back in the chair behind his desk, and he looked up at the white paint from the new brush. Some black spots revealed, but I was thinking about Colliers in my mind. These monopoly tycoons have become accustomed to trampling on power and authority, and if they are not restricted in the future, it is hard to imagine what they will swell. In the first two years, Du Lin hopes to become a wealthy person, to provide a better living environment for his compatriots, to improve their social class, to become a People all over the world know their names, so that he does not lose money to the world. But now, his ideological realm seems to have risen a lot and he is starting to think about more things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalists, empire, business, monopoly, competitiveness, one word after another flashed through his mind, he felt that he should do something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
