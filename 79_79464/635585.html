			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duma is indeed a very smart guy. He is not only a very talented person in the profession of tailoring, but also very deep in his life and communication. Arrogance. When Dooling did not show the membership certificate in accordance with normal rules, the Duma knew that no matter whether Du Lin was or was not a member of Paul's ready-to-wear, he must at least confuse the previous one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tailor shops and ready-to-wear stores don’t seem to be the fastest and fastest place for information circulation. In fact, this is not the case. Most of the consumers in Paul's ready-to-wear stores are social high-ranking people, and the information they are exposed to is often the fastest and most up-to-date. In the long process of tailoring, they can't say a word, and the whole process is boring to match the work of the tailors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will talk to the tailors for a boring time, or friends in the same group will discuss some of the things in their circles, so how many tailors? If you are young, you can hear some. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duma has heard that in the recent period, a young Guart named Du Lin stepped on the "Woodwood" and "Lizard Man" "Gordor", now one of the three giants in the city like the wine industry, is fighting against the joint efforts of the other two. The news about Du Lin was very fragmented and complicated. The Duma also had a fairly complete understanding of Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a young man with a slap in the face, if it’s just that, it’s not surprising that the city of Ternell is so big, the number of teenagers who are so hot and hearty is not many, not at all. Become a talk. The key is that Du Lin is not only as simple as a slap in the face, he is also daring, has a very high means of doing things, and in just a few months has completed what others have been unable to do for a long time, even thinking about things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when he asked Du Lin’s name, the moment Du Lin said his name, Duma decided not to sin. Perhaps he is not clear. Three months ago, the hot "big man" wanted to seek a craft here, but he was rejected by "very polite". If he knows, don't say three thousand three hundred, he doesn't dare to pay for a penny, and he will post some money to go out. It is a good fee to exchange for Du Lin to calm his anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will arrange for people to pick up clothes, goodbye sir!", Du Lin waved and left with Mason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls ran away with tears as they left. "They are not embarrassed, Mr. Duma?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duma shook his head and placed Doolin and Mason's clothes in the first production order. The "villains" like gentlemen and dulin are different. Gentlemen don't blame others for their stupidity. The villains never admit their mistakes, so he knows what to do. Fortunately, the strict system allows a certain amount of time between each order, and it will not delay the delivery of the clothes behind because of the people who cut the queue. This is unfortunate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why didn't you remind me?" Mr. Duma looked up at this time and looked at the girl. "You should tell me that it happened the first time." What, instead of waiting for trouble to hit my face, madam!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving Paul's ready-to-wear store, Du Lin only said a regional policeman after getting on the bus. The bureau was caught in meditation. Any business must have a unique and long-lasting ability to make long-term, private wine and other gray industries can do cash cows that quickly gather funds. But to get more people's recognition, get recognition of status, and gain respect from people, you must have a legitimate identity and some legitimate business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garment industry is in his consideration. In another world, the garment industry is extremely developed, especially the so-called “luxury” and “world”. "Famous brand", the cost price of tens of dollars can sell thousands or even tens of thousands of thousands of days. In Doolin's cognition, how much difference does the clothes have in addition to a brand and ordinary clothes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be some differences in fabrics. Those big brands have their own research facilities to make unique materials, but in addition to materials, there may be only clothing designs. . They sent materials and styles to the processing site for processing, and then shipped back to the country for export, earning a hundred times the profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, there is no problem with fabrics and design at all. Until now, the capitalists’ active spokespersons have actively proposed that “innovative knowledge such as formulas should The slogan of being protected and legislated for this, the action of the empire is still very slow. The reason is that the New Party and the Old Party are making a profit by stealing these formulas through various means. They will not give up this huge profit in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignore materials and design references, the rest is production. The lack of mechanized production is indeed a headache. However, the labor here is very cheap. In some poor areas, as long as you eat rice and give a salary of one or two dollars, there is a large amount of labor that is willing to work for the power of capital. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
