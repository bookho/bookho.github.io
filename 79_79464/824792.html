			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do we go to Otis now?" When asked to sit on the ship, Buddha asked, he had no opinion on where to go, just a little curious . If you go to Otis from Irian, it is much faster to take a steam locomotive than to make a steamship, and it is more convenient, after all, that place is in the interior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and replied: "I have to go back first, and I have been away from home for more than a year. I have to go back and see, you are." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This road is not too far, from Irian boarded the ship to Monter, and then transferred to the steam locomotive to the city of Tener, the entire journey takes nearly ten days, This is already very fast. Sometimes Du Lin is also very curious, when did the group of the Imperial Academy students get the plane out? It’s much faster to go anywhere with the plane. From the head of the empire to the other end, I’m afraid it’s more than a dozen hours? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Du Lin did not know that the empire had long been flying equipment, but because of some technical problems, and the practicality has not continued to study. Of course, it is not the high-tech thing of the plane, but the airship. When the Civil War broke out, the Empire sent two airships to attack the federal logistics warehouse from the air, but unfortunately, when one flight flew to a third, there was a leak, which was forced to fall on the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second flight was a little farther away, and then it was blown and blown back by a strong wind. From then on, the airship plan was completely stranded, the empire Transfer all R&D personnel to other projects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have considered whether to convert airships to civilian use. Although there are still some shortcomings in various technologies, the problem of civilian use is not a big problem. Later, it was said that because of the security problem, it was abandoned, and the air transportation plan was completely over. Under the premise that technology has not been further developed, it is unlikely that aircraft and the like will appear in the next five years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Montreux, Doolin and Sophia met, and after having had a lunch together, they rushed to the steam locomotive of Turner, no Excessive stay. After four days, the two men finally got out of the car with a backache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passenger station and the cargo station are not in one place, there are several railroad tracks in between, more and more materials need to be transported here, the station of Tener Two temporary lanes have been expanded when they left than Doolin. The workers in the station were sweating and trying to carry the goods. Many workers did not even wear clothes. For these coolies, summer is always the most difficult. The hot weather makes them often dehydrated. If you are not careful, someone will need to stop working. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just glanced at him far away and turned and walked outside the station. He sometimes thinks that fate is very interesting. If he didn't meet the Graf guy, he doesn't know what he is doing now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many people staying in Tener, and the station is not as crowded as Montreux. Many people sit in the station after getting off the bus. On the bench, wait for the steam locomotive to take to the Federation, or further afield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again set foot on this land, whether it is Du Lin or Dudu, there is a very special feeling, all Buddha looked at Du Lin, Du Lin Shrugging his shoulders and said: "Go to your home first, or I will go there again after I go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha’s family, Du Lin, has been there. But there was no real going in. He also had three younger siblings. When the mother of Dudu saw the Buddha, he quickly wiped his eyes. After confirming that the person I saw was really my son, she rushed over in surprise and held the Buddha in her arms. Dudu is a little helpless, but his eyebrows are full of smiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, his mother looked at Doolin, and some restrained slightly bent over, "Mr. Doolin, this time with you Are you back? Right, have you had lunch before? There is a little bit at home..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin immediately returned, he smiled and pulled up the Buddha The mother's hand did not care about the thick mud on her hands, and the old man like a sickle. "Mrs. Buddha is my best brother. It is my best family. You don't need to."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin had already won the awe of the Guars before leaving Tyner. Although he was young, almost all the Guarts supported him. Also respect him very much. He brought real and real changes. Many children are following Du Lin. They spend more than ten to twenty dollars on their family's accounts every month. This money may be just a small amount of money for Du Lin, but for the Tener people living here, it is a huge sum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people often want to ask questions about the children who follow Du Lin, when is he still missing, if not, can you use your own children, here? Everyone sees their children as proud of Du Lin's service and is proud of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mother of Dufo said the name "Mr. Doolin", there were a lot of guerts on the street soon. Some looked at the eyes with amazement, and then rushed over with enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha has retreated to the side, and some of them laughed at Du Lin. In fact, they already thought about what would happen before they came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Doolin, are you thirsty? Do you want some water?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, what do you think of my eldest son? He can swing a 30-pound hammer, which is definitely a good blacksmith!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more people around Doolin, and Du Lin can only raise his hand and press down, which makes the noise like the vegetable market quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tnel's guerts have more than a thousand households, and there are at least a hundred of them gathered here. These people look at Du Lin with enthusiasm. Dooling also said what they are interested in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first place I came out of the country was Turner. I have very special feelings for this place. Every one of you is like me." My best friend, my family. Many people have told me that some people are proud of me and I am proud of my status as a gult. Similarly, I am proud of you! I can never forget this place forever. I can't forget every drop of blood that I have flowed here, every hope of harvesting, I want to thank everyone, if you don't have support for me, there will be no Du Lin today!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sincerely looks at everyone, he will not forget those compatriots who sacrificed for him and left the world for him. He said with deep affection: "I will build a free school here. From primary school to middle school, all expenses are exempted, and the children attending school can also have lunch and dinner at school for free..." He said that when people came here, people immediately cheered up, just like a holiday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, they don’t care if the children can learn anything useful in school. The reality is very cruel. There is a saying called “People are short-sighted,” They don't think about any better development after their children receive education. They think about lunch and dinner. For the Guarts, who have three or five children in each family, children are definitely one of the heaviest burdens in their lives. Face each day with three or five mouths and stomachs that need food, which is enough for them to do so. go Ape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been said that why a lot of children are born, this is a question that will never be answered. Perhaps it is some kind of incentive from the bones, perhaps it is not to let the Guar people's blood gradually become scarce or even cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter what it is because they have more children, the Guarts are always a huge group, not a "minority"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they cheered enough, the voice gradually subsided, and Du Lin continued to smile and said: "Besides, I will build a hospital here, any melon. All of us can get the best medical services for free, even low-cost drugs. For those who have family difficulties, don't worry, I will let the hospital exempt you all the expenses, including drugs and treatment. Fees!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People cheered again, they surrounded Doolin, championed Doolin, and regarded him as the savior of the king and the gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short meeting, Du Lin finally escaped the street with a little "wolf", the girls were too enthusiastic and even wanted to take him Drag home. Looking at Du Lin's wolverine, he couldn't help but laugh, Du Lin glanced at him, standing on the side of the street while finishing his clothes, while wiping off the saliva on his face. Rubbing it, he couldn't help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing so many things, isn’t this the moment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything you do is recognized by people, that feeling is much better than ever. It is no wonder that some wise men have said that the joy of harvesting is far more than the happiness of harvesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two laughed, they suddenly found a guy who was coming towards them suddenly turned and quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dudu and Du Linlian exchanges did not communicate, they chased up. He was very fast, pushing hard when he was close to the guy, and the guy lost his weight and fell to the ground. Dufu inserted a hand into his arms. As long as the other party was a little abnormal, he did not mind killing people in this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the two didn’t think was that the guy was lying on the ground and making a roll, and the two palms were stuck on the chest and waving in a small area. Looking at the eyes and being "invaded", his mouth shouted "Don't hit me"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delier! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin lightly coughed, Delier snorted, then smirked and opened his eyes, twisting and screaming, "Mr. Du Lin ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
