			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorkeeper settled for a few years after a "armed appeal" failure, transforming a way to achieve his personal ambition and desire through political participation. This time he did better than the last time. He established a very strong interest relationship with the capitalists in the west and even the capitalists outside the west, and they have become a huge network. These capitalists helped him to complete his political program, successfully implement his political ideas, and achieved great results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he also helped those capitalists to "reduced" the wages of the workers, saved a lot of money, and at the same time opened a red light on some projects, let These capitalists have also received enough returns. In particular, the fact that the door farmers have tilted their policies toward these capitalists in some western cities has reached a level of arrogance, so that both sides have been in the honeymoon period of cooperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temptation of the “Three Guarantees Policy” has enabled the Mennon to quickly gain the recognition and trust of the vast majority of locals in the West, plus his and his interests. With the help of the partners, the state government has basically been overseen by the farmers. However, he is very beautiful. There is a businessman's innate ability to let the governor have nothing to say, and he feels that there is nothing wrong with the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A son of the governor has been nominated by a new party member in a small city, and the next step is to become a formal member. In addition, two sons worked in the Bondika Group, as the deputy manager of the investment department, and Lu Dawang Chemical Group as a minority shareholder. In addition, his younger daughter was also assigned a good job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor himself has a place to go, the doorman has provided a huge amount of 1.8 million yuan to let him open the ascending channel, if Harry comes to power after the end of his term He will go to a state in the south to continue as the governor, and after four years he will have the opportunity to become a member of the cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mennon is still respectful to him, except that some special affairs will take the initiative to intervene, and others will not interfere with the independent work of the state government. Each month, the governor will also make a lot of "political contributions", which makes the governor very satisfied with the practice of the door farmers, everyone has taken care of each other's decent, and will not harm each other's interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can be assigned to the governor of the West, basically the kind of person who came to the end of the political career. Well done, after the end of the term, there may be promotion and appointment. If you do not do well after the end of the term, you will be retired after a party is idle. It is a great joy to have the current changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone quickly moved to the doorman. After the doorman knew the incident, his attitude was very simple. He continued to drag on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring can be delayed for a period of time due to spring ploughing, and there will be a wave of tobacco growing season after the end of spring ploughing, and those tobacco groups are not Fuel-efficient lights, they are even more mad than the arms group. It may have been too much pressured by the federal tobacco, and the tobacco industry has ushered in a wave of eruptions. A landlord is holding a lot of money in his hands and even God is not in his eyes. Wait until the fall and the autumn season, as for the winter... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the nursery season, zoologists are not saying, to protect the Gobi wolves in the west and all kinds of wild animals, water pollution is the biggest damage to these wild animals. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 11:00 am on Monday, the state government’s regular meeting was just finished, and Mr. Mike returned to the office and looked at some of the records at the meeting. The area of ​​agricultural land in the western region has increased twenty-nine times this year compared to last year, and the largest contributors are the tobacco groups. The special climate in the west makes the tobacco produced here have a mellow fragrance that is very different from other places, more sunshine time and abundant groundwater resources, plus the soil fertility that has been activated and deposited for many thousand years, and has been studied by the tobacco group. The people's praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year’s tobacco sales explosion, and with the signing of the Memorandum, tariffs on some commodities will be reduced, including tobacco. The federal tobacco merchants are unable to obtain more government dumping subsidies from foreign trade, and have lost great competitiveness, so that the Imperial tobacco products can not only defeat these foreign cigarettes within the empire, but also make their products indistinguishable. Selling to the federal government in the case of treatment has brought great benefits to the tobacco group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So almost all tobacco groups are starting to frantically expand their tobacco fields, and some are even considering moving their headquarters to the west because the taxes here are more Low, and there are some subsidies. This is definitely an excellent growth environment for the increasingly traded tobacco group, and it does have an amazing appeal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, the Imperial Cabinet issued a document to the three western states, and the Cabinet is planning to establish a new SAR on the West Coast to increase reinforcement and the West. Trade links between. Even the Navy has begun to enclose, they have to build a military deep-water port on the West Coast, which was also approved by the Imperial Military Department, and was the first military plan to allocate funds to the Navy after the North-South Great War. The military does not expect these navies to win glory for the country, but at least to ensure the safety of the empire's waters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the signing of the "Sea Areas Act", the importance of countries to the sea area has increased steadily. Recently, there has been a new voice inside the military department. They believe that the navy should be reintegrated into the military development plan and try to resolve with the navy. The contradiction between each other... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are very far things, Mr. Mike flipped over at random, packed up the things on the table and was ready to take a lunch break. It was at this time that the door of the office was pushed open without knocking on the door and his permission. He glanced at the man who came in and subconsciously, and suddenly frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the nasty guy who’s already been there twice, and the second time he’s brought a thousand pieces to give him. To tell the truth, to be honest, he really wants that one thousand. His salary is only fifty-five a month, which is worthy of his two-year deposit. The problem is that the doorman has accounted for him, and he has to drag it down anyway, so he can only refuse his own conscience to reject the application of the guy who represents Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of the doorman to the big man is totally different from that of the little person. He is very satisfied with the big man, but it is simple and rude to the little person. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either roll, or take my money as I said. However, everyone is very fond of this set, after all, this is the western, simple western. When the fist is not big, the bow is the most correct choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, your application must be placed...", Mike suddenly stood up because Ellis opened the door and stood. On one side, a man in a blue-and-white formal suit with a top hat and a black white trench coat came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took off his hat and placed it in the hands of Alice, then walked down to the chair opposite the Mike table and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike knows this person, it can be said that everyone in the entire state government knows this person, his name is Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin... Sir, I didn't expect you to come over in person. I explained it to your men. I didn't mean to make it difficult for you. This is not the case? It’s just that the state government’s policy is like this. When the meeting was held this morning, the governor also mentioned that it is necessary to ensure the smooth progress of farming...” Du Lin said nothing, and Mike explained it. He was a little panicked. He didn't think that Du Lin would come in person. This guy is not a good person, and he is not a good person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't know much about Doolin's things, but can even be fooled by the doormen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and leaned back against the back of the chair. He asked, "Continue, I want to hear you." What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...no, sir." Mike snorted and some uncomfortable standing behind the desk was like a The student who made the mistake was caught by the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dufoen standing next to Du Lin took out two rolls of ten-dollar denominations from his pocket, and Peng’s slammed on the table, Mike’s The eyes were suddenly attracted to the past by these two moneys. With his understanding of these people and the money, this must be two thousand without any doubt. However, this money really can't be taken. If you take the farmer, you will definitely find him trouble. He still doesn't want to lose the job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, please tell me, can my license be processed?" Du Lin looked at him seriously and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike struggled for a moment, "Sorry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he said the word sorry At that moment, all Buddhas supported the table on the desk and leaped gently. The body slid down the table and the gun in his hand reached Mike's temple. The cold muzzle made Mike's brain blank. He felt that this group of people was crazy. He actually shot in the office building of the state government. Didn't they know what it means to kill here? According to the laws of the empire, this means that they attacked the state government. This is a riot, it is to be suppressed, and everyone will be executed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that the gun’s muzzle is now against him, his throat is swiftly swept away, his hands are slowly raising, “Don’t be impulsive Mr. Doolin..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give you two choices!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First One choice, I will immediately get the license I need. I am an imperial businessman who abides by the law. I need this certificate, and you happen to be the official who handles this certificate. Your excellent business ability allows you to be the shortest. I handled this in time. Then I left with a certificate and you took the money home to reunite with your family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second choice, me I shot you here and then accused you of grabbing my gun. In order to protect my safety, my people can only kill a 'front' official who is mad at money. Of course, for humanitarian reasons, I will compensate. You are tens of dollars, at least let you burn with a fire in the incineration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
