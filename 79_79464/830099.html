			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A steam locomotive site has a "broken road" for train repair or parking. At the request of Doolin, and the pistol of the Buddha's hand, the driver of the steam locomotive worked very well with the work of the local city hall, and sent the carriage suspected of transporting illegal and illegal materials to the stop, and then hanged. The remaining three carriages were parked outside the station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the passengers on the platform looked impatient, and some people were expressionless, trying to find out among the group of smugglers It is a very difficult thing. At this time, the goods have been deducted, but not rushing to be the most important thing they should do. Find out the situation. If you can buy the people here, then buy it. If you can't buy it, these people will start to think about where to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A train can carry almost five hundred cartons of wine, that is, six thousand bottles of wine. Even if their home is very conscience, a bottle sells 20 yuan, and 6,000 bottles are 120,000. I lost 120,000 at a time, and it is very difficult to estimate that I want to die after I go back. These smuggling groups that live on blood in the knife mouth can have no shackles like benevolence and morality. It is a good brother to bring profits, and it is the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways to treat the enemy. After all, they run around the country, and some even participate in cross-border trade. There are many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at this time, the person responsible for the escort is not in a hurry. Anyway, things have already happened. It is impossible to find a place to hide or leave the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the faces of these people one by one and finally coughed. "I am very sorry to transfer you to the platform. I am a local city." Long, you can call me Mr. Doolin. This is the second week after I took office. Here I need to convey to you and popularize the most basic imperial law!" He looked at the crowd and maybe this time. The guy who escorted, he is too familiar with these people, so even if there are several people, you can smell the smell of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was watching them, they were watching Du Lin, and Du Lin slowly said: " Tax evasion is a very serious and wrong Behavior, if necessary, not only need to re-pay taxes and compensation for large tax evasion fines, but also face punishment for imprisonment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few people in the crowd who pretend to be good, but after Du Lin’s words are spoken, the natural expression on their faces is somewhat distorted, and the eyes are flashing a trace of sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tax evasion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not smuggling? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pointed to the train compartments that were temporarily detained. "I have just checked it a bit. These materials do not have any tax receipts. This is illegal." Gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen! Tax evasion is a shameful and illegal act, but if you can make up for your wrong behavior and pay a fine for tax evasion, I believe local courts and judges will choose to forgive you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone makes mistakes, but after making mistakes, you should bravely stand up and admit your mistakes and bear the consequences. This is what an imperial citizen should do. Escape is not The Warriors’ behavior, only the coward will choose to escape!” Du Lin once again looked away from the faces of the passengers. “You can choose to escape your responsibility and leave by train. But you can also take responsibility. Go to the City Hall to pay the tax, how to choose not to be with me, but for you, my words are here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three If, after no one to admit these things, but also not willing to pay fines and taxes, I will publicly destroy these things! ", He nodded his head, then left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Du Lin left, more than a dozen police officers locked the car door and walked into the station's office. There they can see the cars at a glance, and Doolin has let the steam locomotives leave, even if they can take them back, they can't take them away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The station was very empty, and no one left, as if there were no escorts at all. When the people who stayed at the station told Du Lin about the news, Du Lin just smiled. He knew that these people would leave temporarily but would never really leave. It will not be long before they will come back again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin guessed the wrong thing. He thought that he might have to wait for a day or two or those people on the last day, but those people would appear that afternoon. They came to Otis on a sneaker steam locomotive and did not pull the goods. The reason was to travel here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't care about the surrounding desolate environment and the city without any entertainment in the city, their reason is not bad. When these tourists came out of the station, they were dumbfounded. They also understood how ridiculous they were to use the excuse of traveling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of seven people in this group, headed by a woman, she looks like she is in her thirties. There is absolutely no romantic plot in the imagination of this person. The woman is not beautiful. It can be said that there is still a bit of murder and ugliness. There are two knives on her face, which ruined her to be a general face. These two knives were left when she was forced to ask for information after being caught by her opponent. She suffered more torture, but these tortures were not on her face but on her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the empty streets with some irritability, and whenever there was a wind blowing, there would be a gust of sand, and there was no one outside the station! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can this ghost place live?", the woman named Sally licked some cracked lips and looked at the street in the distance Say: "Look at the advanced city, inquire about what the ghost place and the mayor are doing, and then consider whether you want to contact the other party!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morning Her people told her that the goods were deducted by Otis, and Du Lin’s remarks were repeated. In the afternoon, Sally came over from Nano Lindes. She was deducted from the two compartments of wine, adding up to more than 200,000. If the goods were lost here, the person who lost the goods would be unlucky, she would have to be unlucky, so she had to come over and see how to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the feedback of those who have feedback, there seems to be room for relaxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After twenty minutes of walking, they finally entered the city centre of Otis, watching the city like the countryside, Sally once again began to doubt that this ghost place is Not a city, or is it just a town? She used a dollar to learn everything about the city from the old population who was basking in the sun and woven a blanket, but did not include the new mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember they said that this guy is called Doolin, let people inquire about it, see if you can find someone who is familiar with us to match us."揉 揉 揉 咐 咐 咐 咐 咐 咐 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 揉 很快 很快 很快 很快If she wants to leave by car, there will be a column that will pass by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone suggested a proposal, or stayed in the first two days before going to the mayor. Kelly’s view is different from others, and the longer they wait, the more passive they are. Their weaknesses have been caught by the other party. If they don't honestly think about it, they still want to delay time or fight. Isn't this forcing the other party to change their mind? She decided to go directly to the mayor of the city. As for whether this is a trap, she doesn't care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time she was not afraid of others invading her, her breasts and one side of the buttocks were cut off during the trial, if anyone would like to infringe She, she should probably feel happy, which will make her feel that she is spending money to find a man not because she can't find a man, just to solve loneliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Buddha opened the door for Sally, when Du Lin saw Sally, the impression of this woman was very deep, a very ugly and very male The woman is also masculine. He just looked up and saw no more. Now it is not that he asks others to do things, but others ask him. Sally is not in a hurry. Why is he worried? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I met a senior government official in the position of the mayor, Sally was still a bit embarrassed. She stood at the door for almost twenty minutes. Realize that I have been ignored. She knocked on the door and asked, "Are you the mayor of Doolin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his head at this time, "It’s me, What's the matter?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selly walked forward, walked across to the Doolin table, and found a chair. She was a bit awkward, and the soft chair gave her a feeling of insecurity. She had long been used to hard benches or chairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, my staff told me because of tax evasion...so you detained my goods here?", when Sally said tax evasion When the words are more awkward, when is smuggling become tax evasion, but this is a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is black gold or black goods, you have to go through a road to whitewash, that is, pay taxes. Only after paying the tax, these things can be regarded as real whitewashing, complete water flow or process, and even do not need to explain anything when you encounter the inspection, not to save money, just take the tax payment certificate out. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why something that should obviously not be transported can be transported by rail, and the tax payment certificate is obtained, it is not their business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
