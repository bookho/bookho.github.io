			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Ma's gaze could not retain the rolling forward of the rolling wheel, and gradually disappeared in the autumn colors of the country. Mason was very excited. He kept stroking the leather seat, and at the same time he was a little restrained. He looked curiously at all the things he could touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is your car? Do you want a lot of money?", Mason smiled and wanted to raise his hand and take a photo of this small relationship. The shoulder of the younger brother, but the palm of his hand stopped when he was one inch away from his shoulder. He was not sure because he was afraid of the unspeakable majesty of his brother, or because the white suit was too expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin casually stuffed a box of cigarettes into Mason’s hand and said with a smile: “This car is actually I’ve grabbed it, if it’s my own I think the truck is much more useful than this good-looking car."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason took the cigarette and took his arm back. He grew up. Looking at Du Lin in the glasses, I can't believe my ears! This car was actually grabbed by Du Lin? God is on the top, you must know that Mason, the second child and the three brothers of Doolin are the closest to each other except the big sister at home. They have always been together since childhood, and the relationship is very good. What kind of personality is different from each other, he is not clear. I believe that Du Lin, who was very kind from an early age, would actually do something like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at Mason’s confused eyes, Du Lin knew that the explanation was not necessarily useful. He could only shrug his shoulders and shake his hand to put the window down. . The wind in the country is not the same as the wind in the city. It has a sweet taste and a bit more scent - the smell of the earth. There are not many cement roads here, and there are not so many steel jungles. Of course, there will be a strong earthy smell and the taste of grass flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lit cigarette was very bright by the wind, and Du Lin took a sip and turned to look at Mason. "I understand that for a long time in the past The metropolis is a place like heaven in our fantasy, but when you are in the city, you will gradually discover that there is no heaven, there is a gateway to hell!", said here Lin took another breath, and the wind shook his hair, making him look free and easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason learned the way Dulin had before, and he also shook his car window, lit the cigarette, and looked a little envious of leaving home only three Months, but already a very different brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s hand with a cigarette was very arrogant and casually pointed to the direction the car was driving. “In the city, money is everything. Everyone is marked with a price, or high, by various rules in the city. Or low, this has something to do with your status and what kind of background, but it has nothing to do with what you can do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The former is in people's The eyes represent the upper class, and the latter..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and shook his finger. "It’s like me, just like you, it’s not flowing. "The inferior!", he leaned his head away from the ash that was blown back from the window, and continued: "I don't want to be humiliated by the feet, what should I do? Of course, I use my life to fight, at least at this point, We are no different from those of the upper class, we only have one chance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, my dear brother, if you think the city is heaven , there will be an eternal sleep to welcome you back to the embrace of God. But as You understand my words and regard it as the door to hell. Maybe we can struggle for a while, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason swallowed Spoofing, he suddenly found that going to the big city to enjoy a new life seems not as simple as he imagined. Fortunately, every member of the Xerma family has a good quality and character that is not bad. If you don't understand it, you can ask one of them. Mason lost his cigarette butt and corrected his sitting position. This was what he learned when he was a police officer during this time. "What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is also the reason why Du Lin is willing to return to his hometown to come to a big city. First, he can fully trust his brother. Second, his brother never does anything "unplanned", at least The developers are not themselves, they almost never cross the line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can trust, accept control, and you won’t be in trouble. There is no better candidate than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen, I will buy you the position of the next branch director...", Mason’s stunned Du Lin’s words, Du Lin turned I rolled my eyes and continued: "My brother, the bureau chief, you only have twenty or thirty people under your hand. There are three in the city like you. There is a general office above you. Is this nothing, understand?" After feeling that Mason has stabilized, Du Lin continued to say: "I just gave the lizard Gotall overcast, so I will arrange you in the Dongcheng branch, and my power will gradually move to Dongcheng District." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are only two things to do after you take office. The first thing is to spend money, spend money, and try to spend money. I will arrange someone to teach you how to do it. The second thing is to take unwanted people. Sending away, changing to the people you need, and then maintaining the law and order on the surface is as simple as this. I believe that you can do it well, which is much simpler than being a sheriff in the country!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not a sheriff, a police officer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his hand and smiled and said: "Take him, it’s all a meaning. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason is a little nervous, "I don't think I can do it well, it may disappoint you." He said very sincerely, this way Du Lin's description turns the city into a dark castle full of destruction and decay. He feels that he may not be able to swim like a fish like a fish returning to the ocean. Sometimes he admired Du Lin, the first to leave the family, took on some heavy things, and was the first to mix so well, and he was very good at doing things, and he was very good at doing things... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at him with his head tilted and gave him a punch on his shoulder. "The Zema family did not fear the soldiers fighting, be careful of me." It’s a very interesting little joke to the general!” For a long time in the past, everyone thought that Mr. Kemma was a ruthless general, and they were soldiers, so they were in the back. Mr. Cheng Xima was a general, and they stopped until the metaphor was understood by Mr. Xema. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason touched his shoulders and straightened his spine... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the expectation and expectation, the two brothers came to this place that Dulin called the gate of hell, looking at the bustling streets and looking at the road. For the first time, Mason felt that there were so many people, and the goods could be so many! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car parked at the door of a ready-to-wear store, Paul's ready-to-wear store, which is a very good ready-to-wear store in the city, dedicated to the elites of the upper class, and Do not accept ordinary people. In particular, the three main tailors in the store will go to Orodo every time to receive the latest trend information and learn the latest clothing styles, and serve customers wholeheartedly, so that this old store has a good reputation. And customer source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin needs two sets of formal attire, and also needs to make two sets of formal attire for Mason. Although I don’t want to admit it, many times these "facades" are indeed very important things. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
