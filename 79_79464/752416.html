			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like the city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood on the edge of the cliff looking at the waves The former squadron collided on the cliff, and some of the water and mist that was raised under the sea breeze would be raised high, then slowly fell and landed on Doolin's face. This feeling is particularly pleasant in the summer, the whole body and mind are washed aside. He looked at the distant Haiping line and the dozens of ships near or far from the Haiping line, taking a deep breath of salty sea breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city is different from Tener and is different from all the cities in Cannes. From top to bottom, from inside to outside, it is a new party. The people are controlling, these people are more flexible in their ruling, and their concern is definitely not "who is not obedient", but "how to build a better city." Perhaps because of this, people accept that the New Party is far more ruling than the old party's estimates. They care too much about their power and care too much about political issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, money is the only eternal truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s hands and feet did not reach the police station, but Scott could, the mayor could. Strictly speaking, this is a real murder. Du Lin provided the script and was responsible for the previous implementation plan. Scott was responsible for the adjustment of the center. Finally, the mayor was responsible for all the closing. Not the Kurt and the mayor, the police in those police stations can really pretend that they don’t know what happened to let an important prisoner “hang” and commit suicide? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They really don’t know if the guy was hanged after being strangled? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They certainly know that they are doing these jobs, how could they not know? However, there are opinions of the mayor of the mayor. It is necessary to complete the case as soon as possible and not to regenerate the accident. Therefore, these police officers also play the role of each of them in strict accordance with the script. It is not important for those who leave the world to be innocent, because in the general trend based on the whole city, the value of the individual has long been weakened to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Du Lin’s cooperation with the City Hall reflects this, and Du Lin is also very clear that his tacit understanding with the City Hall is only for this. Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there will be two, three, and more, and Du Lin is not worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott was standing behind Du Lin at this time. He didn't like to blow such a strong sea breeze in such a high place, but Du Lin liked it, he had to stay here. When I heard what Du Lin said, Scott smiled a lot. "I also like this city, quiet, beautiful, I have been to many other cities, but I can't find anything like Irian." The city is the only one in the empire and the only one in the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are doing well, here is the only one in the world!", Du Lin turned Body, walking towards the house, Scott followed. "I like it very much, so I plan to settle here. Do you know? I also invested in a company, the largest theater company in Irian." As they walked, Du Lin gave Scott a shot. "They want to raise 200,000 yuan to upgrade the equipment of the theater, and they can play the color. I heard that "Irian Holiday" is going to Shoot with a color camera and then play it out with a color device."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott thought about it before I thought of Du Lin’s "biggest" home. What is the line company, but he frowned a little and looked Turin hesitantly. Du Lin was curious and made a gesture of asking, and he said the words in his stomach. "You are talking about East Coast entertainment? You said that the biggest time made me feel overwhelmed. They used to be the biggest hospital. Line companies, but that doesn't mean the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, three months ago, someone started preparing to build a new theater. They won in the early stage. Twelve plots, and later plans to take another 12 plots, the City Hall has already approved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire Ilyan has 8 million Is it reasonable to have a permanent population but only 16 cinemas? Obviously it is unreasonable. If it is not in the past, no one may be aware of this problem, but as the preparatory work for the eighth district begins, foreign capital has discovered this unreasonable phenomenon. Assuming that 100,000 people need a movie theater, Irian should have at least 80 cinemas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this number is too exaggerated, and you have a half-fold, there are also 40 cinemas. To know that once the eighth district is completed, Ilyan will become a place where the entire empire group will gather, and it will become a holy place for film practitioners. Under this appeal, it will also become a city of test capital for a successful film. There are 16 cinemas in the district, too few! Therefore, foreign capital has taken a fancy to this market, and plans to build 24 cinemas. Together with the previous 16 East Coast entertainment, there are forty cinemas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin heard about this for the first time, his footsteps suddenly stopped. "Why didn't I see these news in the newspaper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sco Specially stopped, he explained a bit embarrassed: "These projects are closely related to the eighth district, so you know, we are not going to disclose it before the start of construction. There are still several places that are suitable for doing this. In the movie city, in order to prevent them from committing things before us, many things are still in the confidential stage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean I invest The 200,000 hits?", Doolin didn't know what to say. He was also ambitious and intended to spread the theater to the entire Irian and then expand outwards, but waited for Scott's late signal. This makes him have a very funny feeling, someone is cutting off Hu! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Scott can only smile awkwardly, he comforted Doolin and said: "In fact, you can sell the shares in your hand to the new one. The tycoon, he is actually very interested in East Coast entertainment, he should be able to sell a good price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is that person? I want to talk to him. Talk!", Du Lin quickly shunned his own ideas, since he can not be the biggest, then partnership. He incorporated East Coast Entertainment as his own capital into a new company and became a shareholder of the new cinema line. He also controlled the theater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott showed an apologetic smile, "Sorry, I am temporarily...", he suddenly found Du Lin looking at his eyes and couldn’t say the taste. Like the wolf's eyes seen in a hunting ground, cruel and hot, he swallowed his stomach back and then took two steps, whispered: "You know the newspaper tycoon over the emperor's side. The George family? They plan to expand their business, not only in Irian, they are building new cinemas elsewhere..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin knows the George family, this It is a group of literate madmen who hold 27 newspapers in their hands, attracting readers' purchase subscriptions through various amazing titles, and let them take great success. About four or five years ago, the George family's industry was divided into two camps, half of which published the news needed by mainstream society in a rigorous and steady style, with political news, financial news, and military or people's livelihood. News on the side. The other half do their best to publish the next three things, often related to crime, cyan and the like, among them, the "Good Morning Empire" known as the Empire's first lace newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
