			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a remedy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man bathed in the sun with his eyes closed, and the dust in the air danced slowly in the light. Everything was so quiet, but his heart was inside. The waves are raging, and no second is calm. Political struggles have always been the most brutal battles. There is no smoke on the battlefield, no guns and rain, but everyone will fall into this whirlpool and struggle until the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether the other party is a new party or not, the trap has been buried, and even more terrible is that the idiot of Gothor has been trapped by traps. It is very easy to get him out of this matter. I just need to say hello to Mrs. Vivian, and give up some of my face. Mrs. Vivienne must have given him a face. The matter is erased. But will this leave behind any clues, will it leave flaws? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man thinks about it and thinks about it. There may be some problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For political wrestling, there is no difference in size. The big problem is just to save the fermentation time and some necessary means to let the other party directly expose. True intentions. Small problems require fermentation time, and other means are needed to expand the seriousness of the problem, and the same can be achieved when the big problem breaks out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the problem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is with Prando! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a criminal case involving robbery and personal injury, and Prando wants to cater to Mrs. Vivian and get it done as soon as possible. In the shortest possible time, some means were used to convict three people and impose corresponding punishments. And all of this is a formality. The formalities are sometimes prepared for themselves, but more often they are prepared for the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the New Party’s people seized on the abuse of power by Prando’s regional police chief, colluding with gangs to obstruct justice, small problems became big problems. After the investigation team of the Ministry of Internal Affairs appeared, I am afraid that even if there is no problem, it will become a problem. The more I think about the elderly, the more I admire the people who made this move. In a very clever and sensitive time, he used this unobtrusive method to promote the whole of the city of Tener with an unremarkable point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is conceivable that once Prando is taken down, the people behind Prando will definitely have conflicts and differences with him, and the new party’s people will be able to smoothly pass the police chief’s office from the site of the old party of the city of Tener. The location is to be dug away. Once the very important position of the Regional Police Director is in the hands of the New Party, they can start cleaning up some people who are not able to see the light, and things, by "enhancing the law and order." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, all the old party forces in the city of Tener were affected, so that the avalanche effect was implicated in the mid-term election. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older the more I feel that this thing can’t be touched, the psychological concession is a very dangerous situation, which means that he has begun to retreat, but He did not want to understand himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manage, no, the speed of passing information through the telegram, what happened today in the city of Tener, the next morning, the Empire will be Published in the mainstream media. Moreover, the public and the public opinion did not have the slightest affection for the old party. Once the public opinion began to blow, the corruption of the political system of the city of Tener will inevitably spread throughout the empire in the shortest possible time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if it doesn't matter, Codor will become abandon, and the things he knows, the things he handles are too much, and they are too dangerous. Once he speaks, the unfortunate is not just the old man alone, it will be implicated in all the characters of the old party in the entire high-class society of Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man opened his eyes at this time, murky and dull, and he looked at Godore and asked, "Do you still have the courage twenty years ago?", Saying that he added, "Do you still have the guts to take part in the gambling with life as a chip?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon after a little analysis and understanding of the old man's words Nodded hard, "I can do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man nodded with satisfaction. "Good, I like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prando is a wise man, and he has always taken the initiative, he must have found a way to get away, so in this matter, the only thing that is unlucky is you. One person. But you don't have to be afraid, it is not a big deal to offend Mrs. Vivian. If she does too much, the Governor will advise her. I think you may be jailed for a while. It is not very heavy, it is nothing more than obstructing judicial justice, and the sentence will not exceed three months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;</div>
