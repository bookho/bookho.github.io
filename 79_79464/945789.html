			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the Little Wildcats Bar is just a cover. In fact, this bar was not a bar in the past, but a club called "Don't Reject" Club, in Woodland The special capital has a great reputation in a certain field. Later, because the club’s business scope did not sell alcohol and did not have a legitimate liquor license, it was cancelled in a surprise inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the club quickly paid for the Little Wildcats Bar. The location of this bar is very remote, and almost no one is here to spend it. Zhang Liquor. In such a place with a maximum of only 300 pieces, I sold 100,000 pieces, of which 99% were used on the liquor label. After such a change, the Little Wildcats Bar immediately became hot, and there was no need to worry about people from the Probate Investigation Bureau coming to the surprise inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this is a very open bar, or club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is full of homosexuality and bisexuality, as well as some fetish guys and some men and women who are distorted by sexual orientation. Compared to the women who are prone to sweating and afraid of sweating on the stage of the vulgar bar, there are not only women but men on the stage! The waiters and waiters dressed in sloppy, bare-skinned clothes walked between the decks with a tray, and the whole bar was smoky, just like in a steam bath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is not far away, it is difficult to tell the appearance of the opposite person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong sweaty smell and the stimulating hormonal smell are everywhere. Ornes stunned and watched this grotesque place, many people are unscrupulous. It can be said that it is something that is difficult to describe in public, without any moral and ethical concepts. They don't seem to have an accurate partner. It seems that anyone who is interested can participate in this body, whether it is a man or a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ornes had some nausea, suddenly an irresistible force limited his actions. He turned his head in horror, two Both are muscle spasms, and almost the man of the red fruit grabbed his arm one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., are you coming for the first time? We have a small rule here, we need to search for it, if you don't want to, you can leave now.", The brawny people seem to speak very well, and there is no such thing as forced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reaction of Ernest was to leave immediately, but when he thought of the purpose of his trip, he finally nodded with a dignified expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two brawny men smiled and started a journey of searching that made him a lifelong unforgettable. They carefully searched for anything in his body where they could hide things, even the most private places were not missed, and both people searched again. I felt that I lost some important Orne's inner heart in this moment and gave birth to a hint of killing. He waited for the two men to wait for their shoes to let go, then slowly walked in. In the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has actually seen Richard, in the largest deck in the southeast corner, Richard, who is very educated and temperament during the day, is now like a The primitive man is kneeling on the table of the deck, a woman kneeling on the ground... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ornes moved his eyes and looked at other places. He felt that he should drink a cup of pressure. He went to the bar and glanced at the bartender. The bartender was obviously a woman, but her dress was very neutral. Maybe she was the only normal person in this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me one of the strongest wines!", Ornes took out ten dollars on the table, and the bartender looked up at him and immediately deployed it. A cup of pink spirits was placed in front of him and took the ten dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This place is really the worst place that Ernes has seen in this life, God is on, how can there be such a scum and dirt? Place? These people should really be purified. How can those church people not appear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He regained his gaze and looked at the pink wine in front of him a little weird, well, it was a magical place. He took a sip of the wine, and before he could taste the goodness of the wine, a weak boneless body wrapped around his half body, and the guy snorted on his earlobe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ouines turned his head and saw a man with a heavy makeup and shaved his head wearing only a black leather briefs to wink at him. He resisted the impulse to give this guy a punch and pushed him away. "Sorry, I don't play this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This eye shadow is bright green Mr. Bald grabbed the key of Ernest. "Do you want to try it? Don't refuse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry...", Ernes took out twenty pieces into the man's hand. "You can go find a one you like, or like you. Isn't that better?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this twenty dollars played a role, the bald man shrugged his shoulders, left him and searched for his next goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ornes feels that if he stays here for one night he will definitely have an accident, he immediately picks up the glass and walks towards the biggest deck in the southeast corner of the bartender. When he was near the deck, there was a muscular man who blocked his way. "Sir, this is a private place, you can go anywhere else. Also, your clothes...", the eyes of the brawny I looked at Ornes's body. If Ornes didn't make a mistake, he saw a strong mood swing from the eyes of this strong man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Ernes ignored a personal problem. He is the servant of Soro, the future steward. He lived in the environment of the Cape family since he was a child. His temperament has a huge gap with the temperament of everyone here. How can the glamorous squatters here compare with the noble temperament that he displays? This noble temperament is like the moon in the dark attracts the attention of many people, and the people here breed a kind of temperament. desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ornes pouted, resisting the discomfort and growing temperament in his heart, and holding up the wine glass against Richard Young, who was enjoying it. The wine glass in the hands of Yang, "I came to Richard, I know him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brawny was a little surprised, and soon relieved, he lifted The hand pressed on the chest of Ornes and sighed, "Stay here, don't move." Then he whispered to Richard's side and Richard said a look at him, then hesitated. Nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can pass!", the brawny has some pity to look at Ornes, such a good note can not be happy together, it is really regrettable But the other party is a guest of Mr. Richard, it is not that they can offend such a small beggar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't seem to know a friend like you?", Richard jumped off the table and approved a dress. One almost did not wear it. The man in the suit immediately lay in his arms and smiled at Ornes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ornes nodded, he wanted to sit down, but the decks were all similar, and they didn’t seem to let it go, until When Chad let a guy around him let go, Ornes found his seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have something to hope for the help of the governor, but the governor seems to be very busy. I don't have time to appreciate my sincerity. I just heard that..." He smiled. "So I think you might be able to help me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard smiled very contemptuously, his eyebrows pick one, "sincerity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Europe Ness nodded a little, "sincerity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He placed the checkbook on the table, and the ten generations of Gnoucha mycelium bought in the afternoon. . When the checkbook appeared on the table, the young people in the deck did not have the slightest intention. Only a few young girls had their eyes lit. These young people are Richard's good classmates, good friends, and each has a very good family, otherwise they will not be his friends. On the contrary, the ten generations of Gecko Mushrooms have changed the expressions of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the emergence of the contraband investigation bureau, such things have become more and more difficult to buy, especially the dried hyphae, they can often buy It is an injection of an anesthetic. It's not that they don't have money, there is no way, no one dares to sell hyphae to them. At most, getting some anesthetics is relatively mild, so it is enough for them to have fun when they need it. Not everyone has the courage to offend the Governor of the Governor for a profit of tens of dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard also has some intentions. He picks up a bag and sniffs it, his head suddenly rises upwards, and the dried hyphae of Ghost Mushroom is a little irritating. He gave the bag in his hand to his friend, then grinned for a moment and nodded. "How do you want me to help you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Help me convince your father to let me see my sincerity. As for whether he is willing to accept it, that is the problem between me and your father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Richard stretched out a finger and picked a fingernail from the bag in his friend's hand and sent it to the front of Ornes. "10,000 pieces, one pound of dried bacteria." Silk, and this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In hesitation and struggle, Ornes took out a cigarette with his eyes closed and poured the dried hyphae In the smoke, then went in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the sly Eunes freed himself from the slanting limbs. He frowned and just wanted to stand up. There was a tear in the blink of an eye. His face was black and dripping, and slowly walked over to find his torn clothes and put it on his body, and glanced at Richard, who was still asleep. If the Governor is unwilling to accept the sincerity of Mr. Soro, then he will kill this kid and everyone here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
