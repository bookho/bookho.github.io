			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, Totti took two men in shirts and tie and asked for Du Lin outside the manor. The eighth district will break ground tomorrow. Lin said to Totti at the time that the drawings of the playground project needed to be revised before they could be built. The two people he brought now are the designers specially hired by Albert's manager company, who are responsible for supervising the construction process and can strictly follow the drawings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sitting in the partial hall, the three waited for about ten minutes to appear. He was just on the phone with Scott. The City Hall hopes to invite investors in the 8th district to cut the ribbon for the construction of the 8th district. I hope everyone can attend the ceremony tomorrow. This kind of ritual also started from the federal government and spread to the empire. The federal business atmosphere is more intense. The federation was only a small loose alliance hundreds of years ago. There is no concept of the country. Later, the members of the alliance did not. Knowing where to find an instrument that was said to have been thousands of years ago, the country was formed in accordance with the instrumental agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of federal traders is very high. Half of the members of the Federal Executive Council are commercial giants. The whole society has a crazy worship of money. Anything that may be linked to money and interests is firmly believed. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Great Patriotic War, the citizens of the Yaoxing Empire looked down on the federal people. In the propaganda of the empire there was a group of people who had no evil for their interests. They steal other children's children to sell money, and parents and children compete for family property or wealth to betray and sell each other, that is, the husband and wife will also divorce because of some interests. Whenever people talk about the federation, it's like discussing some barbaric creatures that haven't evolved into adults, and even the most basic morality seems to be absent. But after the Great Patriotic War, the arrogant imperial man tried to reach the military wing from the federation, and finally realized that the federation was not a weak barbaric land. There is a civilized world as brilliant as the Empire. Perhaps it is because this war has hurt the imperial people, and fears, people have begun to learn about the federation, and even learn advanced technology and experience from the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chopping is such an exotic product. There will be ribbon-cutting ceremonies in some federal events. They will invite local officials and celebrities to participate, one is to arouse everyone’s Pay attention to and pay attention to it, and secondly, it is to discuss a good color. This little means of not involving ideas and politics was very popular after being introduced into the empire, and even more popular than in the Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is simple. The empire's official weight can be much heavier than the federal officials. If a ribbon-cutting ceremony can invite some heavyweight officials or celebrities, it will be better than advertising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Scott’s invitation, Du Lin’s consideration was not considered, and then he said something else before he hangs up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torty stood up the first time Duron came in, and the two designers followed up with some restraint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, there was a phone call that was delayed for a while." Du Lin smiled apologetically and invited them to sit down. "We don't stand here, sit." Let's talk, just this time, I may have a lot of things. Do you bring paper and pen?", the two designers nodded, and then Du Lin talked about his own ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the beginning, many people were not optimistic about this amusement park, and they thought that amusement parks could not produce considerable profits. I don’t think they are different. If we travel The people targeted by the park are teenagers and children, and the profits may not reach the expected goals or even lose money. But the audience for my amusement park is a middle-class family with spending power, and those who are willing to spend money for their idols, here There is a huge profit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have an idea, this amusement park needs to be redesigned...", he took a point and will Instruct the designers whether they smoked or not, and then dropped the cigarette case on the table. "I intend to make this amusement park the first theme park in the Empire... The theme amusement park means to give loose, purposeless rides. They are a theme, this theme is a movie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the entrance to the amusement park, I will first point out this theme. I need to look at the past It reminds people of the design of a famous movie, such as the famous castle gate in a movie, or what architecture in other movies, at a glance..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has brought a makeover to the theme parks he has seen in his dreams. He wants to wipe out the famous movies of these years, and he has simply designed some that have never appeared in this world. The rides were also designed by someone. The ideas he gave to the two designers were like opening a skylight for their brains, instilling all the information they had in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men worked hard to write a book, and the large section of the paragraph recorded Du Lin’s words intact, and also raised his own questions. Du Lin’s project on this amusement park is more focused than other projects. A project like a shopping mall is a good business cluster. It doesn’t mean anything. If the amusement park is done well, it means that a culture is conveyed in a subtle way. When sitting on a pirate ship, people will think of the fragments of the pirate movie, and when they sit on the torrent, they will recall the thrill of drifting in the adventure movie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an invisible "aggression", if he puts the gods in the Guart culture into the amusement park? If he puts some of his own private goods into the amusement park? People may not be able to wake up in the first place, but this effect is really there. This is just the first amusement park in his plan. Once it is hot, there will be a second, third and even more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recovery of the imperial economy, people’s living standards are constantly improving in invisible places, and more and more people are yearning for consumption. In the past, people were seen as "luxury" behavior to gain pleasure and satisfaction. The economic gains and the subtle influences on the culture are all things that Du Lin is very fancy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social status of the Guartes is too low, not to say that a person who has become a world-famous person can change the world and change people to Guar The human view, changing social status, takes a lot of effort for a long time. He is doing it a little bit and hopes to reach his goal one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "discussion" is almost all Du Lin said, saying that it is noon from the morning, if it is not Dove to remind you to have lunch. Maybe Du Lin still can't feel hunger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will eat it at noon, and I will take it out when I am full." Du Lin invited him, and Totti left to leave. Two designers, he still needs to go to the construction site to watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A designer was a little embarrassed when I was eating: "Mr. Du Lin, I have already recorded these things in detail, but according to If you want the design to be constructed, maybe..." He smiled a little awkwardly. "The construction cost is much more than the budget!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin After listening to the wave, I had a friendly smile on my face. "You don't have to talk to me, money is never a problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meal, the three people "discussed" for a while, and the two designers turned Du Lin's manuscript into a simple draft sketch and description. Standing outside the door, there was some chilly sea breeze. One of them looked back and shook his head and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another designer is also a helpless expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things that Du Lin said are not deviating from reality. In fact, many of Du Lin’s ideas are very inspiring to them, such as Du Lin’s description. Star Avenue, that would be a place where bricks made with star prints or foot prints spread across the street. Just this one idea can be said to be worth a thousand dollars. There can be an All-Star Avenue, is it possible to get an entrepreneurial avenue on Xie Lisi Street? Or do you have an era outside the Imperial Palace? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sighs are for themselves, obviously they are older than Doolin, but they have to travel around for life, then look at Doolin, just need Sit in this luxurious manor and say a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps this is a successful person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning at ten o'clock, Du Lin walked out of the car in accordance with the time agreed with Scott, stepping on the red carpet and illuminating the magnesium Under the illumination of the lights, the venue of the ribbon-cutting ceremony was moved. At this time, there were already many people in the venue. In addition to the local rich and famous celebrities, the foreign forces investing here also sent representatives. This may not be a big deal, but it is definitely not a trivial matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander, who was chatting with people, immediately saw Du Lin’s arrival and immediately yelled at Du Lin. After the two met, Alexander whispered. "What is the situation in Juan? I heard that he has been arrested and sent to the Imperial Army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and looked dignified Said: "It is said that they are suspected of participating in a financial fraud case, the amount of fraud is more than 10 million!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander took a sigh of relief, a look of shock, It took me a long time to come back to God. "I said how suddenly Juan had such a courage to dare to press on his body. The original money was not his!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; At this time, the news that Juan mortgaged all his own industries has not spread out, and those who know this matter can count on all five fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
