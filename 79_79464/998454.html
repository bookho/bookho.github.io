			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, being a patrol on a street that is easily congested, such as a station, is now a very savory errand, and even some old police officers are vying for such an opportunity. On the one hand, it is relatively easy. There is only a short area to visit. You can choose to walk, or ride a horse, or ride a bicycle. It is much more comfortable than a patrol that is half a day. When no one is staring, they can still be a little lazy, find a place to sit for a while, drink afternoon tea, eat some pancakes or something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, it’s about income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes some drivers will be out of a few minutes, which will face dozens of penalties. To know the core emperor of this empire, the salary of the working class has just risen to 40, and the penalty of a few dozens of minutes may sound like a terrible and heavy punishment, but it is not. The rich who can spend thousands of tens of thousands of cars to buy a car, do not care whether the ticket issued by the regional police station to them is ten or one hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a car can afford such a heavy fine, and let these people firmly remember that parking time in these places should not be too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course there are a handful of people who are not necessarily able to afford such a huge fine. They will choose to pay a five-piece "fine" on the spot as a patrolman. Let them go back. Most of the patrolmen will close their eyes with one eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current salary is higher than the previous salary, but the price is also growing rapidly. It is also a kind of effect that it can not make a difference. Give the patrolmen the benefits. The directors of the Regional Police Department and some members of the Ministry of Justice know that such things happen all the time, but they never take the initiative to say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police themselves are a kind of work that is heavy and dangerous, and the welfare is not really good, because there are always some people staring at the police. . The treatment of the police is good. These people are clamoring for the waste of taxpayers. Only by controlling the welfare of the police within the limits acceptable to these people will they be satisfied with the government’s work and will be able to sleep at night. Feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So..., everyone is not easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer stood at the side of the car and did not immediately pull the car on the door. He was waiting, waiting for the opportunity to appear. As one of the lawyers hired by Doolin, his job is to solve all the problems that can be solved by legal means for the employer. It is not unreasonable to refer to lawyers as legal hooligans. These people regard the law as their own rogue capital, but they are still the best in this line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the patrol and Doolin have a dispute, or the amount of the bill is too large, he will go forward to solve this small trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he waited less than ten seconds and decided to get on the bus, because Du Lin could not use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this your car?", the patrolman is a woman, wearing the uniform of the Imperial Police, not as much as one might imagine with a single uniform The beauty has completely turned into a bit bloated aunt. The patrolman also has the power of "blitz check". They can be said to be the first-line police. They often encounter some difficult problems, so the bulletproof clothes are all standard. If you can see something "amazing" from a layer of tamper bullet-proof vests wrapped in police uniforms, it can only be said that there are too many associations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The club president here directly opened the door, and Du Lin did not care that the policeman sat directly in, the female patrol frowned. Her reason telling her that she is leaving now or not doing anything is the best choice, but her sense of responsibility tells her that she should check if these people are illegal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agent went to the timer and looked at it. After more than half an hour, they came very early. It wasn't that they remembered the wrong time, but the steam locomotive arrived too early or late, and they didn't dare let Du Lin wait for them here, so they took a step first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agent walked back to the door and took a circle of money from his pocket, all of which were small notes of five dollars. He randomly ordered ten shots in the direction of the policewoman. The money swirled in the air. He sat in the co-pilot position and said a drive to the driver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver directly pulled the mechanical tie rod to refill the twine into the power compartment, and the catalyst was also poured at the same time, and the body immediately shook. He stepped on the pedal of the power cabin, and the car flew out against the body of the female patrolman. If he was so little, he might touch the body of the female patrol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female patrol looked at the car that was far away, and looked at the fifty dollars on the ground with the slight swaying of the wind. Finally, she silently tore off a page in her notebook, shredded it, and then threw it into the sewer. She had a feeling of being humiliated when she bent down to pick up the fifty dollars from the ground, but she also understood that this is the world, and that is what she must bear. This world is so unfair. In her eyes, a lot of money is nothing in the eyes of others. She even dares to say that these people directly give her money not to save another two hundred dollars, purely I am too lazy to go to the police station to pay a fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put all her money in her pocket, and her face turned red when she got up. I don’t know if it’s because of the money, or because it’s been a long time to bend over. . When she looked at other places, she suddenly found a driver sitting in the car across the road and grinning at her. I took a look at the car with no more than 4,000 pieces at the top. She just walked over with the police cap and said with a very pure Emperor's accent: "Sir, please show your car voucher, car registration certificate, this year. The car tax payment certificate also has your personal identification. I suspect that your car is suspected of a smuggling case..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now the emperor is still parking here. Tickets?” Du Lin asked casually, and then the agent said the docking rules again. He also complained a few words because he also had a car family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds Doolin of a joke that was discovered when I went to the West to understand local laws and regulations, because each state of the empire, in addition to obeying the basic laws of the empire Other laws may choose to be incorporated into the state legal system or not included. It is also possible to expand or delete the state's bills through the state legislature, so each state's laws are somewhat different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Doolin looked at the Western laws and regulations, he found a "Ma Long Act." The bill was enacted more than 30 years ago. At that time, there were very few cars in the west, and almost everyone rode. The horse is a living thing, and the living animal must need to eat to supplement the body's consumption, and naturally it must be pulled. At that time, the towns in the west were full of horses, and even cleaning was not an easy task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the horse fell on the ground soon after it could be stepped on by another horse's horseshoe, in the process of such reciprocating, these horses and horses pee and When the mud land is finally mixed, even if all the stirrups are removed, the ground will present a weird dark green color, and it will still have an unpleasant taste. It would be even better if it rains, people are like living in the faeces. Therefore, the western government introduced a restrictive bill for riding horses on urban roads, commonly known as the "Ma Yin Act", which has the same effect as the imperial government's docking rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All cowboys riding into the city must pay a fifteen-point horse cleaning fee, otherwise they will be arrested and detained for three days. It is not an easy task from the first day of implementation. But today, it seems that people have integrated this bill into their blood. Everyone knows that when they ride a horse into the city, they need to find a police officer to pay fifteen cents, and ask for a certificate to prove that they have started for themselves. A voucher for paying the bills at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the continuous development of technology, people will soon realize that projects that may be punished are no longer just as simple as stopping a vehicle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Du Lin had to stay in the Imperial City for a while, so he chose to live in the Oak Bay Villa area, there is a special person in the villa area to clean, only Need to sign an agreement and save valuables, the community can provide housekeeping services and ensure safety. So despite not returning to the Imperial Capital for a long time, the Oak Bay house is still very clean and tidy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin asked the two to leave the car and left, lying back in the room and lying on the bed, the bones of the body made some sound. The journey from the west to the emperor is really a bit far away, even if you buy a first class ticket, you can't stop the long-distance exhaustion from invading his body. After all, the car is so big, the action is bigger, it may affect others, there will always be some sense of restraint caused by the body can not stretch. Now, finally, you can really sleep for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he got up, it was already eight o'clock in the evening, he called Kevin, and the caller was Kevin's girlfriend, his girlfriend told Du Lin Kevin has now dine at the Kailemen Hotel. Du Lin put on a dress and got into the car. He thought he wanted to drive by himself. He didn't expect the driver to leave with the agents. Instead, he stayed and sat in the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin knocked on the window and threw a cigarette to him, telling him where he was going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About ten minutes or so, the car stopped outside the Kaile Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kailemen was the first project invested by federal merchants in the empire after the Northern and Southern Great Patriotic War. At that time, the federal businessman could be said to be mortal. I came to the emperor to bite my teeth and buy the land and build the hotel. The speculative behavior, which is full of great risks, has brought him crazy profits. Whether it is to meet the needs of the political level or the general needs of the people, this hotel has not only failed to close down, but has become the most famous and most expensive consumer place in the capital. One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
