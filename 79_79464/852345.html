			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Weian knows that the news of Peter’s assassination is three days later, three days ago, the Governor’s Office encountered a terrorist attack, if not the previous day Vivian suffered In the car accident, several bodyguards were hired to protect their safety. It may be possible for her next life to learn about this from the history textbook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her first thought was not a pleasure, but something anger, because Peter actually died, not in her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor’s Office was attacked and killed more than 30 people, including the Governor’s own, who was sent back to the embrace of God by a grenade, Only a dozen people lived down the Governor's Office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that Vivienne believes that the instigator of this matter must be Peter, and only Peter and the Governor and himself have such deep hatred, and the Governor Your utmost threat to Peter is so great that he must make an extreme choice to have a chance to overcome the immediate difficulties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivienne also intends to take revenge in person, but I did not expect that Peter is actually dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After lying in bed, Wei Wei had a blank anger. She is a bit embarrassed. When the Governor is alive, she always wants to do something to let the Governor know that he has made mistakes and wants to let him know that he is not just his girl. But when the Governor’s bloody corpse flashed through her eyes, she was confused. She didn’t know how to go in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to do nothing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no goal for revenge, what else does she pursue? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her brothers looked at her two slyly and falsely, and said something that was equally illusory, the father’s death seemed to give them a kind of Relieved, they did not even have the slightest sadness on their faces, but they showed a kind of relaxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same was true of her, but not now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These disgusting guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fifth day, Vivian received a bouquet of flowers and a letter in the flowers. She was a little curious to take the envelope up and take it apart. She thought about it during the process of dismantling. She thought it should be sent to her by the Buddha. It made her feel a little better, but after opening it, she opened the letter, she The whole person is freezing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear daughter:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I have never shown weakness in my life, I am the strongest whenever and wherever. But at this moment, I actually feel that I am melting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, when When you saw this letter, it means that I have left you and returned to the embrace of God. I think this must be a less sad moment, because I have been too strict with you over the years. I know that you are all I don't like me, I even hate me because I stop you from doing what you want to do and forcing you to do things you don't want to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At this moment, I hope that you can forgive me. This is my last request. As a father, I am unqualified. I am also very guilty because I don't know how to except the imperative requirements. With the child...that is, with you and the two bastards. I have to admit that this is my fault, I I dedicated myself to the empire, but I didn't leave anything for you. I am very guilty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that you can be happy, please believe that this is my most Sincere thoughts and prayers. I still remember that you fell for the first time, secretly used people's cosmetics for the first time, ran out for the first time in a skirt, and cried the son of Count Cathy for the first time... Suddenly I found out that I was a failed father. I didn’t participate in the first time in many of your life. I watched it quietly like a bystander. I have never hated myself so much, why not Leave yourself more time and space to accompany you to grow up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too late to say that, from the beginning to the end For a moment, at least I am still in your eyes, not another person, maybe this will stay in your mind for a little longer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I have done a lot of wrong things in my life and made a lot of mistakes, but I have never been so proud, because I have you. You are the most precious treasure in my life, how much I want to spend more time with you, but God does not allow me to do this. I feel for the first time. He is not merciful to God, why can't you give me a little longer, why can't I let you watch you grow up a little, and I will take me away from you when I am completely relieved."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive me for leaving me with selfishness, and please remember that I will always love you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to say these things, I want to Tell you, I divided my property into three points. My old house and all the jewelry and paintings are yours. Cash and other real estate are your brothers. Right, I have one of you. I don't know the illegitimate child, it is a poor child. If possible, I hope that you can take care of him for me. My lawyer will tell you the specific situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Farewell, Vivienne, I hope you are happy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Love your father forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Vivian knew that Peter was woven about her so-called love, she did not cry, only hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Peter hit her, she didn't cry, only hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she thought she had violated her and betrayed her, she was not sad, she just made herself stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, tears are like raging rivers, flooding the embankment. She licked her mouth and nose and didn't want to cry, but she couldn't do that. For the first time, she understood why there was a word "sad". She felt that there was a sharp blade that pierced her heart. She couldn't breathe when she was sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After crying for a while, she suddenly smiled and cried and said "Bastard", which is the first time she knew the tenacious Governor You still have such a sensual side, and also know that she still has a younger brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wiped her tears, supported her injured body and walked to the window, pushing the window open, the summer sun shining through the world, green Vitality is like a boiling ocean. She looks up at the sky and smiles. It seems that this will enable the father of heaven to see her laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tyner and Orodo’s political earthquake did not affect Otis. As the construction of Otis began to advance, it was already possible to see more on the street. More young people. They rushed back to their hometown from outside, and in addition to seeing the changes in the city, they also wanted to find business opportunities. Any “emerging” city is full of gold, which is the consensus of young people who have crossed the “big pier”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also because of their return to make the city more dynamic. People are communicating the most hot topic in the current city of Otis - demolition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relocation has many advantages. For example, after the city hall has demolished the old house, it will replace the new house with a larger area, and it may be a building. . Buildings are the topic of concern, and living on several floors has become the most popular content in people's chats. In addition to the new house, the City Hall will also compensate for a fee, which is about one yuan and five dollars, which is almost equal to the income of a local person for one year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The families with many members are happy, and everyone is looking forward to a better future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are also a handful of people who seem to be a bit contrary to the will of the mainstream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are they still not willing to move?" Du Lin frowned, and there were probably more than 20 families who were reluctant to move out of their old houses. The reason is that they have deep feelings for the old house, so they are not willing to leave there. However, the actual price is not discussed. They think that the place where they live is in the city center, and the place where they move back has a distance from the city center, so they hope that the higher compensation will make up for the loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natalie shook her head. "They hope to talk to you personally." After three days of rest, she came back to work early, actually Such a thing is not so serious for her. She used to live in such an environment, constantly confronting malicious guesses from her colleagues and harassment from her superiors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially when she heard from friends that Igor was missing, she was more eager to come back to work. In her limited life, she never looked forward to working in a simple office building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She still remembers the moment when Du Lin sent her to go out and asked her if she did not believe that there was a god in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not convinced, but now believes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Du Lin’s eyes, there is a trace of something that makes her suffer. She has never been so tempted, and she has never experienced this as if surrounded by warm water. The sense of security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin put down his pen and licked his wrist. The only thing that he may have improved during this time is his writing ability, at least what he is writing now. It was a bit of relief for Dove and Natalie to see more than half of them without a hint and guess the other half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
