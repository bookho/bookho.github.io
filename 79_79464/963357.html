			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have had a dream when I was a child...", faced with many guests and reporter Du Lin did not have the slightest timidity, he said hello to everyone, smile I started to speak. "I dreamed that I was hired on the ocean with the white pearl. I dreamed that one day I was flying a huge strange bird to the top of the clouds. I dream that one day I will become a great person." He shrugged his shoulders. "The dream is coming true!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People send a friendly laugh, thirty-five thousand people even leave the year of Irian Time is still a legend, still one of the representative figures of Irian. Whenever there are foreign tourists coming here, there will be a tour guide to introduce them to the manor on the cliff, to introduce the owner of the manor and what he has done. There is no doubt that he is definitely a successful person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good-hearted laughter makes the atmosphere here very harmonious, even if it is winter, it is inexplicable and feels warm around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone has many dreams, some dreams can be achieved through their own efforts, but there are also some dreams that may always be just one of our fantasy worlds. Oh, but in the world of movies, through the excellent actors and the efforts of directors, screenwriters and more practitioners, perhaps we have some illusory dreams that will appear on the screen in a different form of expression."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some scholars believe that film is a vulgar performance that pleases the public. I have a different opinion from them. I think film is also an art...", suddenly it sounded around. With the applause of the sparse pull, the applause quickly gathered into an astonishing force. The people who raised their hands and applauded strongly agreed with Doolin's statement. Those film practitioners regarded Du Lin as a confidant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Doolin’s reputation and identity, what he said today will definitely appear in some newspapers tomorrow, which may not change the way people think about them. This is also a change, a process of pursuing a dream. In addition to money and fame, the unremitting efforts have changed to change people's perceptions of movies, actors, and everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and raised his hand, and nodded his head from time to time. The applause continued for a while and then stopped. He continued: "The film is an art. An art of performance that reveals all the impossible things we imagined and sly in front of us in a more intuitive way, and lets us know that it is not a dream, perhaps somewhere, perhaps In another time and space, what we are imagining is what is happening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very encouraged when Lord Hossington told me to establish the eighth district. This is a good thing for all fans who love movies and all the staff. They can even put the eighth district on promoting the film culture. History is steadily moving forward. History is born at this moment, gentlemen, history will be remembered today, at this time, we do everything for the film industry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the 8th District!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Linyi vigorously said the last sentence, waved and waved, and walked down one On the small stage of the temporary construction, people gave a warm applause for Du Lin’s brief speech. Some filmmakers surrounded Du Lin when he left the small stage. These people urgently wanted to talk to Du Lin about the art of the movie. . It is not uncommon for a big person to be able to understand the film work in such a big person and to be able to deeply analyze the film culture. Perhaps from Doolin, they can find more valuable things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horseton’s eyes are a bit strange, and Du Lin’s words are actually very simple, but at this time, this place has a considerable appeal. He is a very smart young man. It is not a simple matter to know when to say something to gain people's attention and recognition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak, everyone will talk, but many people say bad things, and they don’t know if they should talk at some point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Howthon felt the charisma and talent that Du Lin had not shown in the past, he suddenly had a tight heart and was regarded as the future of Austrian aid. Lin, is it possible to become his enemy? This is not impossible. To Dulin's ability to compete for the position of governor of Cosnas, I am afraid it is not too difficult. He has experience in the management and development of the city of Otis, and he has considerable connections. The key is that he has money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People always think that the election is a talent, a ability, these are the wrong views. Election competition is money. In this society where capital is king, no matter how good your political philosophy is, what an excellent framework theory is for a region, but no one knows this, how can people choose you? To make people know, this requires constant printing of various posters and brochures, which need to be addressed everywhere and constantly appear in people's sights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These all cost money and spend a lot of money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry did a lot of work while running for the governor. One of them can be said to have laid a strong foundation for him to become governor, and this is to treat guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He invited 3.77 million workers in the entire Cosnas State to eat three meals, if a worker needs a meal for 35 minutes To calculate, then he spent almost four million on this activity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move is very effective. He let everyone who has the right to vote in the ordinary class know him. He voted for this under the influence of these three meals. "Friends of the Workers", so he won with a great advantage and became the governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Howard’s own? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four million...he didn’t, a million is almost the same, he was able to fantasize about the governor’s position in Cosnas, the main motivation and reason In Harry, the nomination of Harry is equivalent to inheriting most of the influence left by Harry in Cosnas. But what if Doolin jumps out? Can you stop him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on the face of Lord Howard, who was still very happy, became a bit stiff, and he had to talk to Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opening ceremony of the eighth district is very lively, and people will soon know that it will become a big one when he is in charge of Irian. Political achievements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the unveiling ceremony, Hossington asked Du Lin to go to the hotel in Alexandria alone to eat. The two chose the restaurant on the third floor, a restaurant of several hundred square meters. There is only one such table and two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third floor of the Winter Break Hotel will be completely empty, which is also an important place to talk about things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very wonderful speech, I felt full of energy after listening to it!", Horston sat on the dish before the dishes were still up. Lin handed him a cigarette, and the two swallowed up. "I know that you are doing very well in the city of Otis. There are still three years when Harry is leaving. I have considered the position he left. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head while smoking a cigarette. "You said that you are running for the governor? Maybe I am not suitable. Governor nomination is a very important signal. There have been some minor frictions with Harry, he will not nominate me. And if I want to run for the governor at my age, do you think the mainstream middle class will agree with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he finished the heart of Hossington, he was convinced that, without the nomination of Harry, the mainstream middle class in Cosna, which is mainly composed of members from the 30s to the 50s. It is difficult for families to recognize Du Lin. This point is that in the political arena, Hossington knows these people more than Du Lin. When some of the old parties proposed to isolate the middle class and the bottom of society and form a brand new class, the middle class is the one who supports them most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This society is definitely not as simple and kind as people see with their eyes, and the young people who are full of vigor and vitality have gone through hundreds of years of hard work. Even more of the same-aged people have broken free and climbed to a new level. What they want at this time is definitely not a change. What they need is stability. Use stability to solidify the already formed but unspoken class to consolidate the results and benefits of your past efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are more inclined to politicians who are a little older, at least these older politicians will not come up with a measure today, there will be a concept tomorrow, more It will not change the stable social structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that the middle class is the largest interest group of the empire. They need fortresses that cannot be broken, not shells that can destroy the walls! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horseton nodded. "Are you planning to stay in Otis? Any other ideas?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at him with a smile and smiled. "Do you seem to want me to move?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be seen by Du Lin In the heart of Hossington, he was not at all embarrassed. He waved his hands again and again. "No, no, you understand it wrong. I just think that you are still young. You should have the desire and motivation to challenge everything, unlike half of us." I lost my enthusiasm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember when you sent me to Otis, I told you that you are planning to run for governor there?" Lin bombed the ash, "Do you think I am a little in the way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence makes Hossington take some wax, "How come? Actually we two If you can help each other, it will be more meaningful than me or you alone. If you don’t leave the city of Otis, don’t leave the state of Cosnas, for me. But a good thing, at least I've got one of us over there "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
