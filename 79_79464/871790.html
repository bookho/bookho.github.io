			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great invention!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God took the hand of Stan Ein and spilled the gospel "The world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large early morning all newspapers reported on the story of a young medical scientist named Stan Ein, who discovered that through a special extraction method A magical substance called "the essence of wine" can be extracted from spirits. This substance has a strong breath, although it comes from spirits, but it cannot be consumed directly. The effect of this "alcohol" is not to satisfy the alcoholic's endless demand for spirits, but to use it in medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Stan's research report, alcohol can effectively kill bacteria and some viruses on the surface of the object, which is extremely amazing for the open wounds. Effect. Although the irritating effect of alcohol can make the injured feel more severe pain, it can save many complications caused by infection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even federal medical scientists are crazy about this, and the federal highest medical palace publication "Angel" even offered to give Stan Ein the highest "Enoch" The Medical Achievement Award, in recognition of his contributions to medicine and in the medical field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more mad is the private drinkers who finally found a way to extract high-alcohol without using high-value materials such as dragon blood. Many people think that the spring of private liquor dealers has arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, not!", Du Lin sat in the office and looked at the latest issue of the newspaper sent by the emperor, almost all of which was about Stan The story of Ain, even when he was a child, has been reported to a female student, and it is even more interesting that the female student actually stood up and said that she did not mind accepting the love of Stan Ein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put down the newspaper and looked at the woman in front of him, his agent, Sophia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia is wearing a black long dress and is elegant and elegant like a noble woman. From her body, she can no longer find a little bit of the atmosphere of the bottom society. Her As always, the smile is like the spring breeze when spring blossoms, and it can blow into people's hearts, and people can unconsciously relax. "Mr. Doolin, do you think this will affect us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia sent her little daughter to the emperor to go to school. The Imperial College of Higher Education announced that it only accepts applications from elite elites. However, any school that wants to become a world-class university is inseparable from powerful teachers and research institutions. Match, as well as sufficient research funding. Since the Yaoxing Noble Academy was renamed Imperial Imperial College, the nobility no longer donated to the college, so the college, known as the cradle of the Empire Star, will also receive students with special talents, such as some students. Have the special talent of "rich". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One 10,000-semester tuition is enough to make many middle-class and even small riches discouraged, plus other kinds of expenses, by spending money The cost of entering this school for a year is between 45,000 and 50,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sofia’s youngest daughter is actually very good at learning. The poor family has given this family member the motivation to actively change their destiny. Learning is one of them. Politicians are always advocating the dream of the Empire. Public opinion and constant propaganda and learning have made me such a slogan. Many people regard learning as a ladder of fate, although only about 5 percent of them succeed in the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her little daughter’s academic performance is good, but it’s a little worse than the most advanced colleges in the Empire, so she spent a little money and gave her daughter the most A perfect opportunity, and hope she can become a true social elite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia’s mouth doesn’t mean that she doesn’t want to be in her heart. Now everything is given to them by Du Lin. She is grateful to Du Lin when she needs help. Stretched her hand and pulled her out of the mire. But this is not insurance. If one day Du Lin is killed or stepped on - it is not impossible. What if she had such a day? She is likely to return to her past life, although she is still rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But people can’t just stare at the pockets, they need to look forward, and the mountains that are piled up in gold have a day that has been dug, not to mention that she is not too rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly, she came to visit Du Lin and asked about whether this matter would have a bad influence on their career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin threw the newspaper into the rubbish. The sultry heat made him a little uncomfortable. He went to the window and pushed open the window and ordered a cigarette. The face shook his fingers confidently. "This will not affect us, but it will be more beneficial to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put out a finger and pointed to Sofia. "First, we are actually operating channels, not commodities. You need to figure out the concepts and differences between channels and goods. Explain in another simple way. We operate a store with a wide audience and many customers, and the merchandise is only part of our sales."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second...", he took a sip of smoke It’s more than two fingers swaying. “The new method of purifying spirits will not only have any impact on us, but will increase your income. Because the manufacturing cost has dropped, the profitable space is fully Release, my suggestion is that you and others can lower the price slightly after the next month's arrival to absorb more customers and cause market volatility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the technology update makes the cost lower and consumes less, it will completely disrupt the market, so the world in Du Lin's dream may have already finished. The theory of what and what is said to be up to 18 months, isn’t the market going to explode once every year and a half? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is no such saying at all. The replacement of technology is actually a kind of reshuffle of the market. The stronger the stronger, the weaker, and the weaker. Eliminated, only the strong, and the market gradually solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This involves more questions, such as research and development capabilities, such as marketing capabilities, of course, these agents are not used by Du Lin now. These things, because the guns in their hands are more advanced than any marketing means and research and development capabilities, but do not prevent the entire private wine market from being cleaned by distillation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the monopoly business that all merchants want, once the market is shuffled, it will tend to be a pseudo-monopoly, thus gaining huge profits. In Du Lin’s dream, there is a company that specializes in the field of daily necessities. When many people face the market’s dazzling array of daily necessities, it’s actually a matter of carefully looking at the authorized companies of dozens of brands to discover that they actually They are all one family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuffle, annex, and promote monopoly, this is Du Lin's next layout for the private wine market. Although he is very clear that he can't do a complete monopoly in this line, it doesn't matter. As long as he accounts for more than 70% of the market share, there is no difference between it and the monopoly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here you need to come up with another concept called inertial consumption. Inertia consumption is a terrible thing. It can be done without knowing it, even if the affected person does not notice it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these more complicated things, Sofia and all agents do not need to know, they only need to constantly sell products. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia breathed a sigh of relief. "I feel relieved to hear you say this, and there is still something about you..." Du Lin nodded her. Go on, she smiled and continued: "Everyone is asking if they want to get together at the end of the year?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has a bit of a move, but wants After thinking and rejecting this idea, he took a few steps back and forth and said: "The emperor has set up an organized crime investigation bureau in the first half of this year. They seem to be eyeing us, so what we need most now is low-key. Acting. Such a high-profile event is not suitable now. If the time is right, I will inform you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last time Du Lin went to the emperor When Kevin told him that as the harbinger of the economic recovery of the empire became more and more obvious, the gang forces in some places also entered the shuffling stage, gradually becoming a powerful gang with a number of loosely structured gangs. . The Organized Crime Investigation Bureau was established to combat these gangs. Just as they prepared to investigate, Du Lin became the mayor and escaped this highly targeted investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the law of the empire, any official with a public office is exempt from part of the criminal responsibility and will only be investigated after leaving office. Only then can the case be filed and cannot be investigated. Can't monitor, can't monitor... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to imperial law for being so fair and reasonable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sofia first heard about this, she was a little nervous, and Du Lin waved her hand. "Don’t be afraid of these people, just do your own. Things can be done, as for the temporary stoppage of the fight, wait until the limelight has passed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Sophia didn’t come to him today, he almost forgot about it. In fact, even if he forgets it, there is no big deal. Now that he is the mayor of Otis City, if he can’t catch him but grab his agent, it has no meaning at all. He can do it in a very short time. Reorganize a group of sturdy, organized organizations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, leave my phone to your daughter, and if something matters, maybe I can help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
