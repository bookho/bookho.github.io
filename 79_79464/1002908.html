			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day, the Turat scorpion, who was watching the tape that had not seen how many times he had read, was alarmed by the quarrel. He was the only tall building in the camp. The head was revealed and asked what happened to the people downstairs. Then I realized that the amount of manure was not enough today, and I lost one barrel. According to the agreement, they only need to pay nine yuan, but the employee responsible for daily settlement does not agree with the other party's request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this part of the loss is finally counted in your own account, isn’t it a big loss? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thurat’s nephew walked out of the tower after listening to it. He walked over to the barrel that was not enough weight and glanced away. The distance and the look of disgust. There is less than one-fifth of the excrement inside, and those who are vomiting do not want to look at the second. Although he is not a real businessman, he has the qualities possessed by most wealthy children, and that is not very concerned about small money. If a reputation is spread in the west because of a bucket of manure, it would be better to kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nine pieces are nine. In the future, such small things do not need to quarrel, directly in the way of today!", he said he walked back to the tower. Continue to see the tapes that have not been bored after many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind him, the young man took out nine dollars and handed it to the camp staff, and let people move the bucket of manure from the carriage. "I won't bring this bucket back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon the barrel of manure was sent to the mine, which contained a lot of excrement, plus After a day of sedimentation and fermentation, there has been a very special smell. Finally, the barrel of manure was asked to be sent to the mine. When the people of the mine protection team watched the slaves place the bucket in the place where the excrement was collected, they immediately left the ghost place. The smell of excrement and the rotten taste that is difficult to dissipate in the mine, mixed with a thick body odor, is like a smell of hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the people of these mine protection teams don’t know, just after they left, a slave immediately went to the collection and placed the wooden boards on the barrels. Pushing open, facing the small half barrel of feces without any hesitation, jumped. The splash of feces and the stench did not make him feel uncomfortable, but he saw surprises on his face, and... hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found it!", he couldn't help but screamed and shouted, inserting a canvas wrap from his hand into the faeces. The person next to him immediately took the water for him, flushing his hands and feet and the canvas package. A group of people silently watched him cut a hole in the canvas with a piece of gravel, revealing the inside of it, and a personal face showed an ecstasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mining area of ​​Brewer Bay has been operating for 11 years. It is very stable compared to other mining areas. After several decades of bloody suppression, the slaves here have accepted the fate of the goddess for their future arrangements. Fortunately, the minds of Turat are all in physical business. Unlike the habit of killing slaves like Andorra or Luke, the private property protection teams of these mine owners do not dare to kill them at will, so that the slaves here live. The environment is much better than other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how much, they are all changed from free people to slaves, and their blood still retains the factor of yearning for freedom. Now, these factors are It was activated once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much in the canvas bag, only ten pistols and some bullets, but this is only the first batch. According to the information on the young man's note, he would not be able to send a hundred pistols and bullets, which gave the slaves in the camp a chance, a chance to regain his freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, there are some things happening in the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of the doorman to the mine disaster has caused some problems. He advocates first identifying the cause of the mine accident and then making relevant compensation according to the results of the investigation. But some things are not as simple as he imagined. He can stand firm in the West because the people here are very simple. If they can bring benefits to these people, they don't mind supporting a new party that has no foundation in the empire. But again, if this new party has hurt their interests, they will not mind showing a more "simple" "seeing" to tell the doorman what is called the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the farmer is very painful now, because he delayed the time of compensation, which led many people in the west to think that he could not compensate, and began to ask him to return it. The "three guarantees" insurance premium paid. This money has long been used in party building and other places, and those people even ask the factory to return their workers' funds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary working class is in trouble, and those capitalists have also spoken, hoping that he will calm down this matter as soon as possible. When the capitalists ate the workers’ money, they naturally laughed haha, and everything was easy to say, but once they asked them to spit out the money they ate, they were not so good. They don't care what they said at the beginning, they just see the result - not hurting the results of their own interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman has privately tried to contact Mr. Roel by phone, he told Mr. Roel, everything Mr. Roel did. They are well aware that he also warned the other party that if the other party does not immediately stop this boring means, he will consider involving the judiciary. Whenever he finds a little bit of evidence, he will hang Mr. Roel on the gallows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the threat of the doorman has no use for Mr. Roel. The man who is on the verge of bankruptcy in the scam has no retreat. In addition to doing so, he can't find any chance to keep everything he has now. If he is bankrupt, he is willing to die, the doorman can't threaten him, and he knows very well that this thing is safe enough if it is so big that many people's eyes are on the land. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigation team did not have any investigation into the mine disaster. They found the crusher that caused the mine accident when excavating the body. The crusher almost completely burst. The pulverizer manufacturer also sent a special person to do the appraisal. The result is that the powder of the stone is mixed with the lubricating oil of the linkage rod, which creates great resistance to the movement, causing the pressure in the reaction chamber to be too high. Caused an explosion. As for whether the explosion can cause the mine to collapse, it is a problem for others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reasonable way to avoid this compensation than the astronomical number. The choice of the doorman is not much. He has considered and compensated for the money as soon as possible. The storm, but doing so is equivalent to waking up to the miners who are also on the verge of bankruptcy, and there is a huge cash machine waiting for them in the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More trouble is that the money is not on the surface for Roel’s, but for the families of the victims of the three hundred and ten mine disasters. In the absence of any evidence, the doorman has no right to continue to detain this part of the compensation. But he is not reconciled. You know that the other person is in the pit of your money. However, there is no other way than to bear all the losses. The feeling is very bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bad feeling reached the peak on Wednesday morning, and Roel actually brought together the families of the victims and organized these people without reporting. In the case of the beginning of the parade, many newspapers and magazine reporters were invited to take photos on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let Roel dispel the person and let him come over and talk to me, we may be able to find a way that both parties are satisfied to end this farce!", The doorman standing on the edge of the window stared out at the window and stood at the forefront of the crowd holding a banner of Roel, gnashing his teeth and saying this. He intends to end the farce at a price of two million, which is 400,000 less than the actual amount. He believes that Roel is absolutely in the catastrophe, otherwise there will be no nearly 300 local miners in the mine. This is contrary to common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a staff member of the City Hall walked to Roel’s side and said something, Roel immediately looked at the third floor of the City Hall. On the first window on the left, he could see a silhouette standing behind the window, and he knew that it was the doorman. He nodded, handed the banner to the people around him, and said something. The people who shouted the slogan gradually quieted down, and Roel also began to walk toward the city hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
