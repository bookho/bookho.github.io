			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s sentence is completely on the commanding heights. When the New Party was “squatting”, it did not agree with the royal family and the old party members to retain the aristocratic class. The privileged class was directly smashed to the ground, leaving only the royal family. At the same time, the royal family no longer has the power to intervene in imperial politics. From the day when the New Party is fully governed, the royal family has become a mascot, or a spiritual symbol of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first few years, the royal family’s annual Christmas Day will appear in front of the public, hoping to remind all imperial citizens in this way, their emperors still Living is only deprived of political rights by a group of villains, and hopes that someone can subvert the rule of the new party and rescue the royal family from the siege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no use for this egg. The fiasco in the early period of the Great Patriotic War has made the entire empire understand the weak side of the empire and face a group. The business alliance that once did not match the shoes of the empire, was almost beaten to death! In the face of the performance of the nobility during the national disaster, the performance of the royal family was very disappointing. They did not do what they should do. Therefore, in the face of the "rumors" that the royal family constantly wanted to restore, there was no wave in the empire. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal family also died, and the nobles also died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years later this year, Du Lin’s words are absolutely correct on the political line, and even Harry can’t find anything to refute. Doolin’s reasons, even his rebuttal, cannot be rebutted—because he is a new party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politics, especially in high-level politics, there is no such thing as a wall-mounted squad, either a friend or an enemy, and there is no third party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitor's face was slightly reddish, I don't know if it was ashamed or annoyed. He wrapped his wrapper and smiled a little low. "Good. Mr. Mayor pointed out my mistakes, thank you very much, so we can arrange these things ourselves!" He said that he also took the initiative to apologize with Du Lin and Harry and sue to leave, then returned to Felicia. By the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong with you? It looks like you are very angry!", Felicia whispered as she turned around, and Vitor accompanied her. A young child grows up to be an adult, and her understanding of Vitor is as familiar as Vitor's understanding of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitor lowered his head and coughed, his fists covering his lips. "Du Lin didn't have any plans, and refused to follow the advice I made to arrange the next few days of travel and life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felika was surprised to look at Du Lin, Du Lin was also watching her, and smiled and nodded, it seems that there was nothing for Wei and Weito The conflict between the two is awkward or evasive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did he say? I feel that you are angry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitol Repeated what Du Lin said just now, did not add a word, did not reduce a word, there is no subjective trace in the tone. A large family like Fatima always has some unfamiliar rules. Once it is violated, it will have serious consequences. One of them is a message. Nothing is added or deleted in the process of communication. No subjective modification or tone is allowed. This is to avoid unnecessary troubles caused by the position of the next person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felika did not speak after listening, just like not knowing what to continue to entertain the guests around, but her eyes are a bit cool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the most important thing about a noble family with hundreds of years of history? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a hundred years of wealth? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a centuries-old network of people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it is the glory of the family. These people have the best things in the world since the moment they were born. Each one is a lucky one born with a golden spoon. While others are feeling lucky, they also carry a lot of things that others can’t imagine. responsibility. The elders in the family will tell them that they will not live for themselves in this life, they can only live for the family, the glory of the family is their glory, and the future of the family is their life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When someone dares to insult the family glory, they must fight back, even if they pay a heavy price! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is more important than the glory of the family, even the lord of the Virgin is not as important as the glory of the family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side, Harry sighed. "I knew, I shouldn't come." He glanced at Doolin and his eyes were very complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a child does something that should not be done, then a person with the right attitude will definitely put this responsibility on the child’s parents. By the same token, when a mayor makes some rude things in front of the big nobility, people will blame him while blaming him, because Harry is the top boss of Doolin, the governor, he should bear part of it. Joint responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inexplicable to become unreliable in the eyes of the big nobility, Harry has a sense of disgust in eating flies, waiting for someone else to send in his office How good is the money, what do you have to do here? Show your face? Definitely successful, Fei Lijia will never forget him, and even the Lord's daughter will know his performance today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sent him a cigarette and patted him on the shoulder. This action is actually very over-the-counter. Harry is his boss, he does this. There is no such thing as honour and ups and downs. It’s just that Harry’s headache has been broken by Du Lin’s three times, and he doesn’t care about these little moves. He even dared to go back to the Fatima family. What would be a big deal if you don’t give yourself a face? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Governor, we are the masters of this empire, these people...", Doolin’s scornful smile shook his head while shaking his head And said: "They are not!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry wants to ask him where he has the courage and conviction to say this, according to the statistics of the current New Party Cabinet, Companies or factories with jobs in public factories throughout the empire account for only 7% of the total workforce of the society, that is, there are still 93% of those with jobs, and their clients are It is a capitalist. It is also graded among the capitalists, from the most ordinary small businessmen to the top chaebols like Fatima and the hymn consortium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this particular group, the total wealth of less than 10% of the chaebol, and roughly 90% of the capitalist Have the same wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, a family like Fatima has about five percent of the total "market value" of the empire, such a huge family What not to fear him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really thought that the so-called new party rule can really settle these big nobility? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is impossible. If necessary, a top chaebol only needs to launch a strike. At least hundreds of thousands of people will have no work to do in a short period of time. If there is no place to go to work, they will become strategic to coerce the cabinet to compromise. arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin felt that Harry was a little... despising himself, but he didn’t care, he was empty-handed in the world, and there was a veteran who killed the nobility. What is he afraid of? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not afraid of anything, should be afraid of these nobles, because their family is big, can not look down on the table, but he is up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the dinner lasted for a while, Du Lin saw that Vitor suddenly left, and he did not care. There was no one in the land of Otis. Can hold back what he does. Next is the climax of the dinner, the gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moderator of this link should be Doolin, but it was disgusting by Vitor that Doolin was too lazy to go up, he was not going to banish the Fatima family. , transferred this errand to Harry. Harry did not express any objection to this. He even breathed a sigh of relief. It is obviously much better to do it himself than Doolin. To make the character of this bastard difficult, he has to make a "surprise" that can scare people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Harry gave the golden one thousand gold denominations in the red silk tray to Felicia, the surrounding guests started spontaneously. Applause, "This is a very memorable little souvenir, it won't be distributed, and it will be given one, it will only be given to the most distinguished guests!", the waiter carrying the tray will put the golden chips in the tray around After showing it, I handed it over to Vitor, who came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri Jiajia smiled and thanked Harry for his generous gift. She took a full pound of chips in her hands and was very beautiful and very touchy. Heavy, is this pure gold?", in Harry's nod, the surrounding guests whispered. The denomination is only a thousand, but its value is more than 30,000, plus the non-issued circulation and numbered certification, the real value is probably above its own value! (There is a typo in front, it is 30,000, it will not be changed, just confirm it.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felika thanked Harry and all the guests present again. Then put the chips on the tray and let Vitor put it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
