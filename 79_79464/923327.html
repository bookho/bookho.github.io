			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lid slowly pushes open, the colorful flowers are clustered with a blood-stained head, and there is a broken mouth on the forehead. Inserted a flower, this flower is a light pink, more eye-catching and more special than other flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that Mr. Todd’s former secretary was shot dead from behind, and the young people who opened the box were screened by this somewhat strange atmosphere. The impact of the smashed a bit, just like seeing the evil spirits and retreating several steps. When he was a little more stable, he shyly turned and looked up at Mr. Todd on the balcony, asking if he would throw it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Todd did not show any expression of fear, only a deep disgust on his face, he waved his hand and let people reinstall this head Then, it was sent to the cemetery of Nam Lindes to be buried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many years, Mr. Todd killed some people for Count Linders, some of whom were executed on gallows, and these people often have Some social status, during the aristocracy, hangman is actually a symbolic way of execution. As for ordinary people, they are beheaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now he couldn’t forget the moment when he slammed the high axe and then slashed it. The blood flew out of the head, and the blood of the cockroach blew out, and the moment when everything was at zero. All his ambitions began from that moment. He was not willing to let others control his own destiny. He wanted to be the one who mastered the fate of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned black into the room and stood in the balcony and ordered a cigarette. There are not many opportunities for smoking in such a position. More often, it is a decompression item that is loved by the upper class. He needs cigarettes now, and what he wants is not happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin killed his former secretary, indicating that Doolin may already know that the fake tokens came from him. He thought about it. There was basically no evidence left in the whole matter. The connection between him and his former secretary was also by telephone. There was no written document. So Du Lin couldn't have any substantial evidence to accuse him. The only thing that made him uncertain was how much Du Lin intended to make this farce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a matter of sitting down and negotiating, and telling him to make a bloody taste of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a moment and picked up the phone and called Louis. After the former secretary finished, there was another person involved in the deeper, that is, his illegitimate son Louis. He has no feelings for Louis, like the superiors and the subordinates over the father and son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Todd."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard this familiar and unfamiliar voice in the earphones Louis I thought I was wrong. When did the "father" take the initiative to call myself? Almost everything he told his predecessor to tell him, never bothered, and wouldn't call himself. He immediately sat in a formal position, somewhat humble, as Mr. Todd treated Louis as a subordinate, and Louis treated Mr. Todd as if he were facing his own boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Mayor, what do you have to tell?", he carefully worded that everything he has today comes from this man, he is not himself when he was a child. I don't hate this father at all. As long as I can make my life better, he feels that the position of dignity can be temporarily abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Todd did not talk nonsense with him, directly explaining the words, "I will leave Nano Lindes immediately, go alone, go to the west, I have friends there. "Louis has not had time to ask why, Mr. Todd has hung up." He looked at the earpiece in his hand and was a little confused, but he was used to obeying the order and he immediately began to pack things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some change, there are a few hundred pieces, there are a few pieces of clothes and two finger-thick gold bars, and the gold bars are hidden in the mezzanine of the travel bag. In the event of an accident, the two gold bars will be his life-saving money. He didn't have a woman who had already taken off her clothes in the bed, opened the cabinet and took out two pistols from it. One is not on the back, one is put into the pocket of the shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the impatience in Mr. Todd’s words, so he must race against time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before leaving the room, he looked back at the wall clock on the wall, at 4:58. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 5:30 in the evening, there will be a train going west, and time is still too late. He rushed out of the door and shoved into the elevator, then quickly rushed to the street, sat in the car parked outside the apartment building, a little flustered to pull out the key into the keyhole and twist the key When the car trembled slightly and could hear the sound of steam exhausting, he put his foot on the power cabin pedal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harsh brakes on his ear made his movements pause, and a car parked in front of his car, just blocking his way, and another car parked side by side with him. Louis was a little annoyed to get out of the window and make a very uncomfortable gesture. "Dog, grab the parking space and wait for me to go out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lives in downtown and has few parking spaces. Unlike his biological father and those rich people, he lives in the quiet and upscale neighborhoods, and he prefers these apartments in downtown Midnders. Going out from the building is the city center, and it is also downtown, and you can enjoy his favorite life anytime, anywhere. He loves it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management company of the apartment also provides the same room service as the hotel, only need to put the valuables in the storage room where the household has its own key, when going The cleaning sign is hung on the door handle and the spare key is handed over to the service desk on the first floor. The service staff will clean every inch of the room and take the cleaning bag into the cleaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these services are for money, ten dollars a month. This is very suitable for a lazy person like him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, two barrels were found in the window, and the steam that was continuously ejected instantly blurred the line of sight between each other. Louis subconsciously stepped on the power cabin pedal, the car went forward, his whole person shocked back, and the car stopped again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down and looked at the dense guns on his chest, and touched the neck that was shot through, and the blood invaded his palm. Life is leaving him quickly. The corner of his eye saw a guy in a trench coat with a hat and sunglasses coming down from the car and throwing a bag of silvery things in the compartment. He knows those things, that is, the tokens he made during this time, and the tokens of five hundred denominations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few seconds of his life, his vision has become dim, and even breathing seems to be out of date, he heard a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Doolin asked me to say hello to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city suddenly There were several murders, and the entire police station was busy. The operators in the hall had almost no rest for a minute. The phone just dropped and the ringtone soon sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not here that someone was assassinated on the street, that is, the house there was in flames, or that someone’s wallet was taken away by several young people. The city, which has been calm for almost a week, suddenly became alive on the last night of the week, as if these people had made an appointment on this day, at this time collectively committing crimes. There are always police cars carrying the police to leave the police station. The number of police officers on the weekend will not be much, and now there are even fewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to some clerks and operators, only six or seven police officers are on the job they can't leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a young man in a postman’s uniform came in with a handbag. He had a cap and the cap was very low, but from the front desk operator The angle can still see the appearance of this postman. He is very handsome, and the first one of the operator is the only thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, beautiful lady, there is a mailing parcel given here...", the young postman looked at the information on the handbag, "Yes I gave it to the police chief and asked him to sign it personally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of the postman is over now, the operator will inform the police chief, then She signed it. But when she was just about to say something, the phone rang again, and she smiled apologetically and picked up the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The postman pointed to the closed door, the operator missed it, and finally nodded, she was really busy, and the young man looked Not like a bad guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man smiled at her and made her feel a little hot on her cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the police chief is making a phone call, and various unexpected incidents in the city have affected the normal life of the residents and there are complaints. The phone hit the police station, even the State Police Investigation Bureau, and his boss was seeking his explanation as to why there were so many cases in the case of Nano Lindes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the door was knocked, he yelled into the microphone and then came in, and then accidentally watched a postman walk in with a handbag . He soon didn't care about this young postman, but stood up and stood sideways on the window looking at the scenery outside the window, explaining something in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
