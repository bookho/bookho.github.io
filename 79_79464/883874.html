			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;瞧瞧 These people, the people of the Imperial Bank, the people of the Imperial Chamber of Commerce, and the people of the Ministry of Finance, honestly say these people and Du Lin Not all the way, there is still a gap between them. After all, the 30 million gold that he took away was not only the Chamber of Commerce, but the other two were offended by him. He didn't understand why Mr. Jack wanted to invite them here and also to meet with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr. Jack can’t say one, he will immediately turn around and go to the king to blame it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jack gave a wry smile and slowed down. "The king means that these people are all people who can cooperate and they can provide more stability." The money, but also has a higher execution. King of the King let me tell you that he is selfish, he wants to maintain and deepen the relationship with these people and the organization behind them, so invite them to come to me Chat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can choose to make them our partners, or you can pretend to know nothing, the specific choice lies in you, not in I, or the king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not expect that the king not only had selfishness, but also conveyed his self-confidence through Mr. Jack and put the final choice In his hands. He thought for a moment and whispered, "We are afraid we can't satisfy their appetite... unless I pull in more people, I will call you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Then Mr. Jack took Du Lin to the banquet hall, then closed the door, Du Lin called Harry, and called another to Colliers. Harry couldn’t come over immediately because he was in the capital, but Colliers is nearby and already on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting for about twenty or thirty minutes, Colliers arrived here, and he also brought Harry’s plenipotentiary – Harry’s Scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colliers is naturally famous as a railway tycoon. The three great people present know him. Du Lin asked Merlin to take Surrey everywhere and turn around. By the way, the door was closed. After thinking for a while, he started the real theme of today - how to cause great damage and impact on the federal finance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big men in the room thought that this was just a small gathering of friends in the weekdays, or making new friends to enrich their own small circles. When Du Lin said the theme of today's party, everyone became extraordinarily serious. This theme, which Du Lin puts forward, is more attractive to them than making new friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As everyone knows, in the Civil War, which has always been unclear who won, the federal government has firmly placed the empire’s tariff rights in its own hands as a condition of armistice. This makes the empire very disadvantageous in the trade between the two countries. serious. According to the armistice treaty signed at that time, the federal government will hold the imperial tariff for at least 30 years. After 30 years, the empire needs to pay 5 billion stars to redeem the tariff right and achieve the purpose of tariff autonomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the payment cannot be made, then the Federation will continue to hold actual control over the 20-year tariff, which is a three-plus-two agreement. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for that war, if it’s not the momentum of the new party within the empire suddenly became huge, the royal family would not try to calm the external war as soon as possible to prevent the new party from taking power, perhaps not There is such a shameful agreement. But the agreement has been signed, saying that if more, it will not help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People may not feel any change to their life about this agreement, but this agreement has made businessmen feel the pain of the Empire management. Deep pain, this will become a thorn, forever inserted in the heart, even if it is pulled out later, it will leave obvious scars, and will never be forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economy of the empire has been sluggish over the years. It can be said that the trauma caused by the war is too heavy and has not recovered. It can also be said that the empire lost too much initiative in foreign trade, which led to the economic development for a long time. Until recent years, technological innovations have solved some of the problems that have been plagued in the past. The effects have loosened some financial markets and achieved economic recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin said that he wants to hit the federal economy, these big men are beginning to pay attention to it, if they can give federal finance at this very delicate time. The market has brought violent shocks and great negative influences. It not only gains certain initiative in bilateral trade, but also is a major event that invigorates the national spirit of the country. At this moment, interest seems to become less important, and what matters is how to make the federal people unlucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentlemen in the room are listening to Doolin’s narrative of his plans, and they are constantly making calls so that they really participate in the game. The number of members has grown from about 10 people predicted by Doolin to more than 20 people, including Magus, and a guy named Kubar. This guy is the current party leader, the former Duke of the Empire, the royal family. Members, the generals of the Guards Corps and a lot of titles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Du Lin’s plan has grown from 300 million to 700 million. Everyone decided to play a big one. It’s not the most important thing to earn more and earn less. The important thing is to let the federal feel what it is called pain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this was originally a small plan... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the room, Suri has been staring at a picture hanging on the wall at the end of the garden corridor, she can’t touch the picture through the glass shield But she seems to be listening to people who have said this picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a shoemaker in the painting, sitting in the corner of the room with a shoe, a total of thirteen people at the door and window of the house. Looking around him, these people have deep surprises and lofty respects in their eyes. There is a white cloud in the upper left corner of the window. In the white clouds, a child with long wings can be seen smiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This painting is called "work" and is the highest achievement of Fendi, the representative of the famous ideology school more than 400 years ago. Countless scholars and experts have In this painting, I saw something different. There were even more than ten different books on the market to explain the meaning behind the painting and what Finti thought when drawing the painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps because the painting’s reputation is so great that Su Rui soon recalled it, and she did not expect that she could see it here. The painting is simply incredible. Although I don’t know if the painting is true or not, look at the surrounding environment and look at the astounding decorations. It’s hard to imagine that there will be a shit in a bunch of dazzling gold coins, so Su Rui thinks this The painting is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed with a long sigh, she has done everything she can to understand the world of rich people, but at this moment she understands that if she is not Among them, it is never possible to understand how the world of the real rich is different from the world of ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can put thousands of blankets under their feet instead of hanging on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can cover a lampshade worth hundreds of dollars like a work of art in every corner of the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can make a toilet with a huge piece of agate and embellish the gold on the edge of the toilet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of them... is really incomprehensible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This painting is worth at least 3 million, but it is so silently hung here, there is no constant temperature equipment, no lights, no reporters There are no scholars, no students and teachers who are studying or studying paintings. It was thus hidden in this no-man's corner, losing its glory that it should have! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to this painting?", Merlin didn't understand these things. In his opinion, this is a somewhat inexplicable painting, probably a shoemaker's hand. The shoes in the shoes were too stinky, so the guests were scared to the outside of the house, and there was a kind of disdain in the eyes of these guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;瞧, everyone can interpret different things, this is the charm of the works of the most top art masters, this is the innovation brought by the consciousness genre to the oil painting world. It is hard to see such a great work until now, and many artists have begun to reflect on what has changed what the artists have created, just like the dead soul without soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Merlins don’t know, he’s just curious, why Suri, who is constantly exclaimed by the decorations and ornaments, is silent about a painting. It is. Suri looked back at Merlin and sighed again. She understood that this was the life she was pursuing, a life that she could catch, but Absolutely not the life she wants most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Merlin has a higher level of knowledge, has a higher taste for life, and has more life fun.... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe she can’t be Merlin’s girlfriend because she doesn’t deserve it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go somewhere else, it's really big!", Suri took Merlin's arm and walked along the promenade to other open rooms. She gradually lost some of this luxury castle and soon became awake. She realized that this might be the place where the princess should live in the fairy tale, but she is not a princess, she can not bring a crown, she can only be a vulgar wife, enjoy a vulgar but wealthy life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People always feel inferior before things beyond their imagination, which has nothing to do with ambition and desire, purely an invisible class crush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
