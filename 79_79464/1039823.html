			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Otto just left the office and his assistant went to his side and licked a few words on his ear. Mr. Otto’s face suddenly appeared small. Small changes then return to normal. Just now his secretary told him that a severely burned body was found in the outskirts of Montreux yesterday morning, and the first case was found five kilometers away from the place where the body was thrown. According to some clues they extracted from the body, and the intervention of the military department, the owner of the body is likely to be the latest promotion of the military office to the major Amp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp was shot and burned and destroyed, and all the people he took to Montreux disappeared. The mission records they carried with them were not found. The site inspectors did not get enough things, and they didn’t have a clue as to why they were harmed in Montreux. But the military department can be sure of one thing, that is, Amp is secretly investigating Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why Amp’s investigation of Du Lin’s case is too long, Amp was shot when investigating Doolin, except him. All the participants did not see anyone dead or dead. Only the body of Amp was burned and found. This is an attitude from the respondents, a silent declaration of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military Department... In fact, the Knights of the Roses have already explained to Magus and other people and won the agreement. From now on, the Military Intelligence Office, The Security Committee will cooperate to form a new investigation team to comprehensively monitor, investigate and collect evidence related to Doolin’s criminal behavior. The reason why this news can let Otto know, is because Otto's identity is actually very special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked to the edge of the corridor and looked at the three luxury cars outside the window, thinking about a lot of things until the vehicles disappeared into the street. At the end of the transfer, he regained his gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This matter has nothing to do with us. I will take the doorman to the interrogation room first. I don't like the air here. I can go back sooner as soon as I go back." Otto said that he turned to his office and his assistants began to work. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the doorman was brought into the interrogation room, his face was revealed as the horse that was about to die, sold as a horse to the leader, lying at night. The expression of the two technical women kissing the gold coins in their hands is the same. The moment before is full of endless joy, the next second hell will come. Now different from that time, the leader, who put the barrel into his mouth at the time, made him unable to speak. Now these people gave him the power to speak but he did not want to talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost knows what happened again. The former farmer has agreed to plead guilty in the cooperation of the lawyer. Federer’s testimony is not much for him, so he can easily confess and then counterattack when needed, not only can Gaining the sympathy of public opinion can also bring trouble to these people. I just signed the bail document and paid a 50,000 bail out of the command. I left the headquarters for fifteen minutes. When he was eating in a restaurant across the road, the group appeared. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They pressed his head on the freshly fried steak, and the hot steak made an intimate contact with his cheek, so far his The left half of the face is still in pain. He looks very embarrassed, the hair in front of his forehead is mixed with the sauce, he has begun to dry and sticky, and some sauces include some spices applied to his neckline. He is now just like a garbage dump. A tramp who has eaten something! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't want to talk! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Mr. Otto came in, he paused at the door, some weird look at the wolf-stricken Mennon, put the pen and paper on himself On the seat, then walked to the doorman's side. He took out the handkerchief, wiped the sauce and beef ground on the doorman’s face, and rubbed it. He asked, “There was a lawyer who came from the first place. He said something that you might not have imagined, so we think It is necessary to bring you back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s much more comfortable after Mr. Otto’s simple wiping of the farmer, except for the half-face that he suspects has been cooked. In addition, in short, you can talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what I did, you need to treat me like this, and I am a public figure, a government official, I will definitely be in my daily work. Offend some people. If every person who has been guilty of my sin has sent me with so-called evidence that may not exist at all, then is it better for me to resign?", Mennon’s heart is actually very nervous, but he Not revealed on the face, he knows that if he can't keep calm at this time, then he will be miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The means of these people are cruel to suspects who have already set goals! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto smiled and leaned back on the back of the chair. "You may not know that the former lawyer, who is from the beginning, is your private lawyer." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the scalp of the doorman began to numb, just like an electric shock. He looked at his face with no expression, and it seemed to be a bit disdainful. "You don't have to use this to scare me. You can just say your purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The assistants on the side began to tell the content of the doorman’s lawyer’s surrender, so that the doorman felt a little scared and had some doubts. In addition to those things that didn’t hurt, his lawyers actually explained Only he was told to find a way to let the four executives disappear. From the current point of view, the lawyer has done a good job. He has already sent these people out of the empire. The question is whether this guy is crazy. Why do you want to surrender suddenly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a fall, find him, I want to ask him why he is going to frame me." The doorman is still resisting. "Where is he? Let him Come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean your lawyer?", Otto shook his head. "He can't come for a while because his mental illness has gone on, Now I have been sent to a madhouse in another city for care. You can't see him in a short time. Whether he is absent or not, I advise you to say what you have done, so that at least you can protect your decent, door. Mr. Nong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I have a way to prove that this is the obscenity of the lawyer with mental illness, but it needs you small Small cooperation. If our first cooperation can satisfy me, your lawyer will not have a cure in this life. He will live in the madhouse for a lifetime and live until he dies."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if you don't want to cooperate, then I have to be very I tell you that he may soon be cured. After all, the treatment level of the Amika madhouse is very high in the Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lawyer was sent to the madhouse by Otto. In the words of Otto, it was to satisfy the lawyer's request. First of all, the madhouse has enough guards and even equipped with firearms. The treatment of the Amika madhouse is among the best in the entire empire and even the whole world. The “fear therapy” they admire can exert a strong effect on those aggressive mental patients. Even if a devil eats into the Amika madhouse, when it comes out, it will become a kitten with teeth and claws. The doctors will let the devil know what is fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you have to deal with these aggressive patients, there will naturally be armed guards, and the entire madhouse is equipped with a 36-strong armed guard. The team, with more than 200 "doctors" with rich combat experience, is simply not possible to disturb anyone who goes deep into Amika to assassinate a patient who is fixed in a constantly flipping bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as the lawyer said, he had a diagnosis report of mental illness. In order to protect his condition while his condition was relieved, Otto was very humanized and wanted to send him to Amika. Hey, it’s so cozy to cooperate with Otto, he has thought of things that others haven’t thought of, and it’s arranged very well. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman is no longer able to continue to guess that the lawyer who was fixed in the horizontal flipping bed of 366 degrees, spit the dark lawyer is not true He was sick and he began to think about Otto. Obviously, the other party wants him to cooperate, or to cooperate and get something out. Only Otto and his assistants in the entire interrogation room, even the rest recording equipment were closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swallowed a sip, and the room was still able to hear the snoring of his throat, he asked a little embarrassed, "What do I need to do? Prove that I am innocent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto is very satisfied with the knowledge of the doorman, he took a pen to the desktop, unplugged the lid, revealing the nib," Tell me where the high-rises of the Dawn of Blood are now, their characteristics, the names and surnames that are used now, how you used to contact them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost subconscious The doorman would say the name Doolin, but he quickly calmed down and said that Du Lin’s name was easy, and he would die very easily. For him, his life is precious, and only once. But the leader is said to have several children. If he dies, he may not feel bad. This guy Du Lin is only responsible for his own when he and the leader are killed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ran away any of them, it would be a nightmare for the rest of your life, but if you don’t say it, then he decided to sell and himself. Those traitors who run counter to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shapk, you already know his name. He should still live in the west now, the specific address is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person in the room has been saying that a person has been writing, and the scene lasted for more than twenty minutes before he stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you have the name of your leader?", Otto was a little unhappy, those people included himself, and the most wanted to catch the leader of the Scarlet Dawn, But the Mennon did not explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
