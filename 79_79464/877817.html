			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin left the city early in the morning, and he saw it in the lush bushes on the road about 20 kilometers from the city. The person he needs to meet is Colonel Gordon from the Imperial District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had contacted the deputy commander of the warning zone yesterday and promised to donate a sum of money in the name of private to establish the "Patriotic Service Foundation" for thanks. The heroic soldiers who died in the Great Patriotic War to defend the great empire, while providing the necessary humanitarian care to the "soldiers" who are serving. Thanks to the deputy commander, Du Lin’s goodwill and praise for his virtue. The exchanges between the two sides were very enjoyable. Through the exchanges with the deputy commander, Du Lin knew that the army was not as comfortable as people thought. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Navy became a self-contained military, it gave the Navy a very limited number of targets, and it was also monitoring the movement of the Army. If even the army is eroded by capital forces, then the last weapon of the empire will fall into the hands of those businessmen, so it is difficult to get a lot of money, or other benefits. But Du Lin has cleverly crossed this line of defense. This little means is actually nothing remarkable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone, especially those who have mastered power, will face an extremely unwilling thing in their later years, that is, let go of their power. And surrender all the privileges of enjoyment. This will almost require the lives of these people. If there are some party members who are still a little better, at least they can mix and drink with the party behind them, but the military is a special occupation that is forbidden to join any party, after retirement. Life is not so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person with the ability can of course continue to enjoy various allowances and enjoy benefits and subsidies from other places, but for those who are not top-level generals, their old age In addition to sitting in the sun in front of the old house, I am considering where to find some money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea that Du Lin proposed is a good fit for the situation of the deputy commander. He is already 62 years old. According to the empire, he is at six. At the age of eighteen, he must retire and leave the army. He took a little money, which is indeed a lot of money compared to ordinary soldiers, but for his level of generals, the money is actually nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Du Lin appeared. After the deputy commander retired, he not only served as the honorary director of the "Patriotic Service Foundation", but also continued to manage his personal connections. This is the most important thing for the deputy commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colonel Gordon, armed with 2,000 soldiers, was stationed in a field 20 kilometers outside the city of Otis, ready to support the city of Otis to suppress the rioters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Gordon left, the Deputy Commander had accounted for him and must see with his own eyes that those "mobs" made things that were harmful to the country and harmful to the people. They can use force to suppress. If this is not the case, if the mobs that Du Lin said did not do anything, then they can't do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not worthwhile to lose a military cap for several years for a foundation’s honorary director. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was close to the camp, Du Lin was discovered by two dark whistle and was blocked on the road. After he explained his identity, a soldier went back to report to Colonel Gordon, and another soldier pointed his gun at the ground in front of Dooling and looked at him with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this less harmonious atmosphere disintegrated when Colonel Gordon appeared. Colonel Gordon had a brown hair that didn’t look like pure blood. The Ogdin people, the lines on his face are very tough, just like the one carved out with a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Mr. Mayor, I am very sorry to have treated you unpleasantly, but I also hope that you can understand that this is our rule!", After Gordon and Du Lin shook hands, they invited him to the camp and explained what he had just happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not angry, he feels that this is not a shame to him, the army should have its own rules and rigid rules, because the army is not a politician, can Squinting and talking, not a capitalist, can squint his eyes. He smiled and said that he could understand, which made Colonel Gordon feel very good about Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the colonel of the Imperial Police District, the rank of Colonel Gordon is far from the superior position of the army base in a small local area. The top leaders of the old and new parties living in the Imperial Capital, the heads of major consortia and the powerful capitalists are the targets of their inability to offend. It seems that everyone has some fear of the soldiers, in fact, it is just to maintain each other's face. In the eyes of the old and new parties and capitalists, the army is a knife. The knife does not need to have its own feelings. It only needs to be able to break into the lower back of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the camp, Du Lin looked around and raised his own question. "You didn't bring a car? Then is it necessary to do things tomorrow?" Is it close to Otis before it happened?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon knew what Dulin meant. He waved his fingers and immediately two soldiers ran into the bushes in the distance, and opened a net for camouflage, dotted with countless leaves. Under the net is a somewhat old military car, which seems to have been around for a few years. These military vehicles have not been included in the replacement order, mainly used, and military vehicles are not the main war weapons. It is difficult to break out of war in the next 20 or 30 years. Therefore, military enterprises have not carried out new research and development on military vehicles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Mayor, we are professional soldiers, so we don't need to worry about our problems. At 9:05, we will definitely arrive at Audi on time. The city center of the city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is very satisfied, he likes to communicate with the military, especially the soldiers at the bottom. These soldiers can reawaken their sense of autonomy after brainwashing by the army, indicating that they have enough wisdom. At the same time, the special closed environment of the army made them disdain to lie, unlike the staff and the generals who had a lot of flowers and intestines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there anything I need to help? For example, food?" Du Lin saw that the breakfast of the soldiers was very simple, that is, a fish. Canned canned meat, and a fruit and a large piece of cake, "I can mobilize some fresh cattle and sheep, or cigarettes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The return wanted to refuse, but when he heard the cigarette, he couldn't help but slide. The Army's salary is not high, the Army is much more pitiful than the Navy's life environment with the ability to mix and drink. In recent years, the military has also been increasing military spending on the army, but the main military expenses have been used in dressing, and there is not much in the pockets of the grassroots soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gordon didn’t refuse, Du Lin immediately understood, “I can feel more confident when I see you here, after all, when I receive a secret report. I said that they are going to destroy the city. I am also very confused. I hope this is just a wrong rumor, so that we can save a little bit of things, so that I will turn back some people to send some living materials, and trouble you to add some meals to everyone. After all, because I let you run so far."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon said a thank you and accompanied Du Lin to say something, and sent him away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin returned to Otis and immediately let Natalie get a car cigarette and a car spirits to his and the place agreed by Colonel Gordon Then he let Dove go to the station to pick up people, pick up the acquaintance, Savy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Doolin needs some new faces and guys who are courageous and not so noticeable. These half-sized boys are obviously the most suitable people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savily is not a person, but fifty people, and when Dove received him, he couldn’t help but look at him more. For more than three months, Savi has undergone strict militarization training in the naval base. I don’t know if the children at this time should be married, or because those trainings are really useful. Not only has he been much stronger than before, but his body has also become taller, his skin has been tanned, and he has a certain momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw Doolin, the temperament of the soldier in Savage suddenly disappeared. He cheered and ran to Du Lin to hug him, then loose. Lying on the sofa, while fanning the wind with his hand, he complained, "Boss, what are you doing? Are you not hot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Hot?", Du Lin snorted. "I live in a steamer every day. I haven't been afraid of heat." He said that he smiled and handed a cigarette to Savi, and Savi prepared to beat his own lighter. At that time, Du Lin moved his lighter to him. "You have almost 100 people under your hand now. If you don't give you a leader, I am afraid that your kid will blame me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where can I! Thanks boss!", he put a cigarette on his mouth before picking up the lighter, there was no excitement from Hite, and there was no Jose when they were promoted. The smirk, the performance is very normal, and I put it together. "I already knew that I can promote the leader, otherwise how can those people take it? "What's the job this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin licked his head and pushed him aside, his face gradually becoming serious. "There are A guy named Bujo, he..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like me to kill him?", Savi grabbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin gave him a look. When there are no outsiders, everyone is a family, so he won’t blame Savy. "I’m talking about business, okay? "Savi's face and the Buddha's face like a hippie smile also converge and become serious. "He intends to launch a strike to force me to bow, but I am not going to do this, so the next step is your mission." Du Lin walked to the door and gently closed the door to isolate the space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white clouds in the sky stop and go, the sun is going to the west without going back, the sunset is dotted with the sky, and there are many people on the streets of Otis. It’s up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
