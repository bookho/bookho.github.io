			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day, the Tenel Regional Police Department had a strange thing, and the headless cases on weekdays actually came from the beginning. These cockroaches are all tattoos. At first glance, the guys who are not good people almost smashed the police station. Although their methods are different, one thing is the same, that is, their goal is to go to jail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small police officer of his hand went to the door, and Prando handed a cigarette to Codor and fired him. The two men smoked silently, and there was no desire to speak. Perhaps it was the feeling of empathy for Codor, and the mood of Prando was also somewhat low. Can Gool come from the beginning and admit that some of his crimes were discovered by his own conscience or suddenly awakened? It is absolutely impossible to get to the status of Codor, even if everyone knows that he is guilty, he will become sinless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is very short-answered, he has too many people willing to sin for him, just like Morris who has gone to heaven to embrace angels, the sin for the gang leader is actually Very glorious things, for some members, is also the best opportunity to leave the gang. Prando believes that as soon as the song is open, there will be people lining up to compete for the only place. But he came in person and personally confessed that he had to bow his head because the man behind him had to make him bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people are you going to send?", playing the ash, and Prando looked through the windows on the fourth floor and continued to gather gangs. Some headaches licked the forehead. More than 60 people have come to the forefront since the present position. This number is a bit exaggerated and outrageous. The district prison is very big, but it can be said to be very small. If you enter so many people in one breath, there is no doubt that the prison is the most powerful in addition to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon sneered, "One hundred people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one hundred people, He felt that he was still a little less. If he didn't need more manpower to maintain the gang's order and deterrence, he even had the idea of ​​packing his gang and bringing it to jail together. This is also the only way he can face the cruel ending, so that many members can protect him, at least not let him die in prison inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had the idea of ​​leaving the city of Tener, had the idea of ​​fleeing this damn fan, but he eventually denied it. It took him so many years to get to this point. If he changed his place to start again, how long would he have to wait? As the boss said, twenty years is really not a short time, but at the same time it is only a moment. He didn't want to fight hard from scratch, so he wanted to gamble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Prando was just about to say something, a familiar figure appeared outside the gate of the police station. He threw the cigarette butt in his hand, turned and walked to the side of Codor, patted him on the shoulder, "I Go on, let's come back later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Codor has nothing to say, he just wants to be alone and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando pushed the door and quickly walked to the old man downstairs. After a good hearing, he bent slightly and stood in the old man’s Body side. The old man pointed to the corner next to him, and the two walked in tandem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone curiously looked at the place of the two, and quickly regained their gaze, the two were talking, but specifically said no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...Yes, I understand...Yes, I know how to do it.", Careful in the wig with a very temperament, face But there was no expression of the butler's appearance, and he kept bowing his head. The face of Chowdor showed a happy expression. I have to know that not long ago, if he didn't want to understand all of this, he would most likely be ruined with Codor. At the same time, he also has a trace of doubt hidden in his heart. No matter what the person who made the plan wants to do, does he have any meaning for the game? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is now, the boss on the Gothor directly discards the piece, and what can be done by the person behind the plan? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This steward is the steward of the Gothol boss. He has only one purpose here, and he is telling Prando in a very harsh tone. The city of Trin is still in effective control, there is no dark power, and it is even less likely that there will be large-scale dark forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the experience of Prando as the head of the police for many years, this is the boss who told him that he wants to "go officially." Politics is a very fascinating game, because every qualified politician knows how to express his meaning in the most vague language without leaving any handle in the hands of others. What is a business official? In fact, it is a slogan to say nothing, but you can't leave such a statement on the fruit of the red fruit. So obviously it is meaningful to borrow the word "public business" and the context before and after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
