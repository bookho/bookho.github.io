			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the private lawyer of Mennon appeared in the building of the headquarters, although some people do not know why the doorman can see the people outside, but think again I don’t think it’s a strange thing. After all, Federer's press conference can be said that many people have been alarmed. Tomorrow's newspaper will definitely report the contents of the press conference with a large layout. At that time, the public opinion circles at home and abroad will be alarmed. At this time, the doormen must definitely find a way to protect themselves. When they know that this person is a lawyer, they are actually sitting on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer wants to plead guilty, so he needs to find a lawyer to discuss how to minimize his crimes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They asked for a room without a sound recorder. The doorman sat on the chair with a sullen face. He looked up at the lawyer who entered the door and deliberately took the table. The record of the conference meeting that Manin was coming to was lost. "Look, I have a big problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer silently recorded the meeting I read it from start to finish, and finally put it back on the table. He took off the golden silk eyes and wiped it with a clean handkerchief. While rubbing, he asked, "Talk about your thoughts, I see "I don't fit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I intend to plead guilty." The phrase of Mennon did not surprise the lawyer, or any other expression, he did not The point was not slow, and the doorkeeper continued. "I noticed that Federer confessed to our interest circle in the west, but I don't know if he deliberately or unintentionally. He did not directly Pointing at me, but pointing to the West Mine. Among the things he confessed, except In addition to controlling the tax rate, I am more like a decent person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Mennon couldn’t help but laugh a few times," he only said now This point, before people have reacted, before their curiosity has been transferred from the West Mine to me, I first recognize the crime and then try to get rid of it. This is my idea. Do you think it is appropriate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional issues should be left to the professionals to be responsible, this point is also very clear, so he did not say something else in mind The idea is to listen to the lawyer who graduated from the Imperial College of Law and has a very good resume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer puts the hand in the pocket, the eyes of his glasses holding his glasses and raising his head to prepare to wear his eyes, the eyes of the gold wire Covering a face that looks a bit like a bad person, the slightly awkward face is softer under the eyes of the golden silk, and the gentle look looks like a crowned beast. He took a book from the briefcase, a pen, and then nodded his head and said: "Your thoughts are very good. I just read this record, but I didn't find out what you said from it. Instead of "criminal evidence," I found some evidence that you are a great politician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have a very good saying. Before people's curiosity is transferred to you, you have to smash this road." The lawyer's understatement seems to be very certain that this will definitely not be a difficult lawsuit. His statement and attitude made the doorman somewhat tickle. When he thought that the worst situation had already appeared and he was willing to bear some losses, his lawyer actually told him that he was not guilty, and there was nothing more eager to know why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer couldn’t help but stand up. He took a few steps and asked at his head. "If I am not guilty, then can I Don't plead guilty? Also, can you tell me why you think I am innocent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer smiled and put down his notebook and pen, he leaned back On the back of the chair, tilt your legs, press one hand on the edge of the table, and the other hand on the back of the chair. He reached out and opened the palm of his hand and made a small movement similar to the display. "Hey, isn't this obvious? The purpose of lowering the tax rate is to stimulate the mining market in the west, and it also responds to the cabinet's acceleration of the entire social infrastructure." Calling. If some of the necessary mineral resources for social infrastructure are subject to high tax rates, this will reduce the desire of mine miners to mine, making them more negative, and will also cause a decline in production, which is not conducive to the western mining resources entering the market. It is even more inconsistent with the cabinet’s call for accelerating social infrastructure.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Reducing the tax rate has spurred the mining owners’ desire and speed of mining, and also This part of the tax stays in society, and consumption can greatly stimulate the economic construction of the entire empire. This is also a good thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for your contact with merchants bulk purchases I don’t think there are any problems with these mineral resources. As the mayor of the city of Villiil, promoting local economic construction and promoting economic development in the three western states are all You must do the work of the mayor. In this process, you did not harm the interests of the empire, but worked hard for the recovery of the empire. Mr. Mennon, anyone who said that you are guilty in this regard, he is a sinner himself. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Construction, defamation, and filth of an imperial official is a felony!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to say Who sinned, I believe that those tax officials who have been seriously derelict are the real criminals!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer explained that the doorman suddenly realized, and even felt that it was. I deliberately tried to contribute to Vanilla, for all the private time in the construction of the West, and also offended others for this, but I changed my complaints against myself. He refused to accept it! This is a trap, a shackle, a filth, and he wants to sue those who have poured dirty water on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But!”, the lawyer’s voice turned, leaving the doorkeeper’s active thinking into a short pause. “But you need to consider other situations. Stupid ordinary people don’t have the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, if you are offended On the contrary, it will lead to a more troublesome situation. They think that you have used some disgraceful means to interfere with the justice of the judiciary. Finally, it is very likely that under the leadership of public opinion, the Imperial Cabinet will send an investigation team to find out all the things. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At that time, you really have a big problem, so you have to plead guilty. I think it is a very clear choice, not only to plead guilty, but also To shape yourself into a tragic hero. After all things have subsided, after a period of time, when we are prepared to reconsiderate, it may be better!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer’s words made the Mennon completely admire, and it is obviously worthwhile to hire such a lawyer for a salary of 260,000 a year. The money he has been distressed now It does not make him feel bad to continue to go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very well, we need to make a plan and then follow this plan. Also...", the farmer looked at the lawyer with some hesitation, "I can completely Trust you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of the lawyer’s mouth is hooked up, and the smile makes people feel that they can’t say it. “Of course, I am a professional. Ethical lawyers, in the process of signing the agreement to be employed and after the process, if there is no national security factor involved, I will never provide any other person or the outside world with any conversation between us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman snorted. "There is still a problem. What about the four executives of the West Mine? They know that I don’t know anything." But this is also a no-brainer..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer waved his hand and prevented the doorman from continuing. "I don't need to know how much they are for you." Understand, I just need to know what you are going to do, you want me to be you What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer’s confession made the Mennon relax a little. He indulged for a moment and looked up. “Do you think they are alive or better? It’s better to disappear?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Of course it’s better to live outside people’s sights!” The lawyer gave his answer directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in a hotel in the city of Montreux on the East Coast, Amp sat on the sofa in the living room of a suite. He kept raising his wrist and looking at the watch on his hand. He and Mr. Tucks made an appointment, this afternoon, three The hour is here to meet. It’s already three and a half minutes, but Mr. Tucks hasn’t appeared yet. The reason why he chose to meet on Doolin's site was mainly because it was the closest to the federal route, and he was already a dead man. Du Lin could not keep his attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inviting Mr. Tucks back to the empire is hoping to get some strong evidence from Mr. Tucks in some way, to correct Duolin and There is a direct relationship between the big gold robbery. Only by doing this can we disintegrate the fortress of Doolin from the inside out. What Du Lin showed in front of people was almost invulnerable. At least, Amp had no way to attack from the front and capture the fortress. At the same time, he completely filled the places where the loopholes were easily caught. Many key witnesses and evidence disappeared. There is no trace of it, so that Anpu Nadulin has no way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin grew too fast, so that Amp felt that this person is a neuropathy, and only neuropathy can have such a growth rate of thought. But even though he grew up very quickly, but he was as young as it was, it was the Tyler gold robbery. He even saw Du Lin's back on his upstairs in the warehouse, and he was sure that Du Lin was sure. There are some loopholes in the Teel gold robbery, some clues that can be pursued, and this is the price Du Lin has to pay for growth - he is young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the moment he learned of the news of Anna’s death, he completely put down his work, specifically to deal with Doolin, which also got permission from the superior. . His superiors are not simply military affairs, but another institution. It may be that Anna’s death has spurred him, and it has also spurred their superiors. Amp finally has a chance to get a glimpse of this special institution called the “Rose Knights”. This institution is very mysterious and magical, but Amp is not interested in knowing what the institution is. He has focused his attention on how to make Du Linfu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to inviting Mr. Tucks, he also used the power he just got and “kidnapped” the gold robbery in Ordo The most powerful witness, a bank employee, her name is Alisa. Amp has already determined the importance of Alisa. She saw Du Lin on the spot on the day of the robbery, but she lied in the enquiry. Now that it is not necessary to pay attention to the procedure, it is possible to use some very good means to pull down the same unscrupulous Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
