			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s all over." Mr. Williams spit a sip of alcohol. He sat down with many people at Beford and the trading house yesterday to discuss how to face This sudden disaster. In the trading process of the stock market, there is a huge amount of losses in a timely manner and it is rare that there is no return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stock has fallen from ten dollars to one dollar, and the price has evaporated by 90%. After all, 10% is existing. As long as you don't delist, maybe there is a day to get back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the problems facing Atlantic Chemical and the Atlantic consortium are not as simple as the huge declines, they are already finished. The Atlantic consortium was suspected of falsifying the earnings and operations of multiple companies. The company’s top executives were all arrested except for the fleeing. An unprecedented huge financial scam has unlocked the tip of the iceberg, along with people’s scams against the Atlantic consortium. Knowing more, and getting more and more people feel desperate, everything is really finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlantic Chemicals and other stocks are unlikely to appear on trading cards, they are completely delisted, and all investors have lost their money. Even more troublesome is that in order to capture this round of market, Mr. Williams not only gambled on his own, but also borrowed a lot of money. He was overwhelmed by the heavy debts. He was bankrupt and there was no operating cost. Under such circumstances, he wanted to get up again and it was almost impossible to complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Befort and his stockbroking company can’t do anything about it. The only thing that can be done is to let everyone not blindly do any transactions, waiting for the federal government’s next bailout. Initiative. After the financial tsunami has passed, everything will gradually improve, and this is the only thing they can do now. Of course, this approach is not wrong in essence, because fear of selling stocks will only make the financial order more chaotic and meaningless. Now that you have lost a lot of money, why not try to wait for a while, maybe there will be some turning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of stocks, the price of futures, and the exchange rate of currencies are all "expectations" in the final analysis. When all goes on, the national economy recovers and national confidence increases. It will get better one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not include Mr. Williams, and quite a few of them, the money they use for financial investment is not from their own assets, but through Private financing and borrowing money. Behind the money is likely to be terrorary interest, or fatal and necessary liquidity, or even misappropriation of the company's money. They don't have time to wait for everything to get better, because they will rot before they get better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Millions of borrowings simply could not be repaid, and Williams’s life was completely shrouded in darkness, including his family. Their family must crawl slowly in the dark, from the former rich to the tramp who are not as good as the poor in the lower city. They don't even have the money to buy food, they can only beg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His property and all assets were sealed up this morning, and he left his house one day, not allowed to wear clothes Carrying anything to leave, he can't find the value to continue to live. Perhaps only death is his true destination. He has signed a divorce agreement with his wife and has assumed all the debts in the agreement. He put all his burdens on his shoulders. He dragged the family from the light into the darkness, so the only way now is to end it all through death. When he was moved into the morgue, his wife and children could have a chance to stand up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After pouring a bite of wine, thinking back to the glory of those years, everything seems to be a dream. One day ago, he was still thinking about going abroad for a holiday, enjoying the warmth of the sun in the cold winter. One day later, he sat here, watching the streets as if there were no souls, and the only people who left the body wandered around, suddenly burst into tears and laughed. The bottle in his hand slammed into the street, and the slamming slammed into many pieces. The numb people did not even look up, and continued to take a weak footsteps, looking for directions with a heavy heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, brother." He turned and hugged his wife, and his expression was very sincere. "I am sorry for you. I was not good enough for you in the past." I know that I am a jerk. I now realize my mistake. Yes, I am a jerk..." The hug does not bring any warmth, but it makes him courageous. "I don't know if I should. You shouldn't be advised to go back to the street from here. It's your choice, but I have to say that I have to leave here first. If you have a different decision, remember to take care of my family and tell them that I love them! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loosened his arms and naturally became soft and slipped from the edge of the roof. The raging winds swayed his clothes, hunted, and the wind that was blown by the wind made his eyes blurred. He closed his eyes slowly, he did it, and paid for all his mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bang, just next to the broken bottle, he lay there. The blood slowly spread along the gap between his body and the ground. The crematorium, which had been prepared here for a long time, did not give him a white stretcher. The ambulance did not give him any necessary rescue. He was It was loaded into a woven bag dedicated to the body, then was thrown onto a truck and piled up with more woven bags... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Williams’s move is like a horn. The former servants are constantly jumping off the high-rise buildings around the two exchanges. Some people, like Mr. Williams, borrowed a lot of loan sharks through mortgages, while others It was the appropriation of the company’s money. They are not dead now, and they can only live in endless despair in the future, slowly waiting for the advent of death in torture. Perhaps this is a relief, a courageous courage, escaping the punishment of reality, leaving sorrow to their favorite people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden financial tsunami that is still evolving continues to ferment, starting in the afternoon of November 24, a parade in major federal cities - a large group The workers who lost their jobs took to the streets under the organization of the trade unions. The unprecedented prosperity of the financial market has caused many small and medium-sized enterprises to reduce their production scale and put more money into the financial market. But the effects of the sudden collapse of the financial markets have caused more companies to be on the verge of bankruptcy, and more workers have lost their jobs. In order to fill their stomachs, in order to fight for their own rights, they took to the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the first angry worker who lost his job, he smashed the glass curtain wall of the store and robbed some of the necessary things in life. Everything has become confusing. Almost every city has risen a lot of smoke columns, humble speculators, gangs, anger workers who have lost their jobs and have no money to fill their stomachs and take care of their families. Under the influence and leadership of some people, they begin to destroy. They trampled on the rules and order of society, and the crime rate suddenly increased several times. The whole federation was like being crazy before the end of the last days! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a harsh social environment, the federal government has issued several press conferences in succession, and agreed to save the country with all consortiums and capitalists. Perhaps these news have brought certain effects. The Federal Shield, which has plummeted by 17.8%, has some support and has not continued to dive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 25th, in the past forty-eight hours, the federal government, the joint parliament, and all federal consortia and capital forces made a common decision, they want Re-launch the federal financial economy, and let the conspiracy of some of the ulterior motives succeed. The Commonwealth Bank will unite more "Knights" to save the current situation. These news did play a role in easing the situation, and some people began to have confidence in the federal government's bailout! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good Morning" even claimed that this was only a "technical" adjustment, and pushed all the blame to the Atlantic consortium, thinking that the Atlantic consortium came from The hostile forces lurked in the important pieces of the federation, igniting the important part of the federal financial order, and then creating a series of rumors and illusions, causing panic and distrust and fear of the federal financial economy. The hands of the federals came to complete the sniper plan. The Federal Financial Management Commission announced overnight that in order to stabilize the market, promote the recovery of the financial order, and reduce the herd effect of the spread of panic, it will shut down the two major trading lines until they think they can be reopened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
