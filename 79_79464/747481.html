			<div id="content">"Hello, Mr. Eric, we met again." Du Lin placed a cup of amber wine in front of Eric. "Taste it, this is the best wine nearby, enough to help you relax your nervousness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eri has just been removed from the hood I couldn't believe the young man in front of me, maybe they knew each other, or Eric felt that this guy was talking a little better. He was heavily tied to the table and pressed down. The fear in my heart and the anger roared. "Damn, you are doing this crime. Do you understand? This is kidnapping, you will go to jail!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, sometimes People are so interesting, obviously facing the danger but thinking that they are familiar with danger, they ignore the truth that everyone is equal before the danger. Doolin shrugged his shoulders. He took a square glass and took a sip of the wine in the cup. The taste of the scorpion was not as good as he intended. I don't know if people in this world love nuts. Almost all high-alcohol wines have a certain relationship with nuts, such as bitter almond-flavored wine, hazelnut-flavored wine, and pine-flavored wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put down the cup and sat on another chair, facing Mr. Eric’s glare, he snorted, “It seems that our Erie Mr. Ke hasn't figured out the current situation, let him be awake!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, a piece of cloth in Eric’s stunned He leaned around his neck and then pulled back. He was just about to get up and struggle, and Ellis took a metal cricket stick and put it on his face. A loud bang, the blood splattered directly, and Ellis smashed the cricket bat and stood aside. Dufoy also loosened the cloth strip. He patted Mr. Eric’s swollen red-violet swollen cheek and said softly: “You have to remember your identity now, Mr. Eric, here is not East Coast Entertainment. The company, not your home, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric nodded his face and said, "Sorry, I think I understand, please Forgive me for being rude!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and spread his hand. "Hey, I said, everyone can learn how to treat others politely. The key is that they are willing to do this!", he picked up the glass and touched the glass in front of Eric. The crisp clinking of the cup was clear and translucent, and the wine in his cup shook a circle. Du Lin's micro-lifting glass, "King civilization and courtesy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric quickly opened his hands and hugged the cup. His wrists were tightly held by the ropes and he could only end the cup in this way. He should also sigh and sip. The blood dripped into the glass and suddenly bloomed, giving the wine in his cup a bright pink color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin turned his hand on the table and looked at Eric very seriously. "Mr. Eric, when you left this Is there a feeling of emptiness after the city? Is there any kind of ignorance? Actually, escaping does not solve any problems, it will only cause the problem to break out completely. Hey, if you don’t leave, you will not meet me. Two brothers, will not sit here to accompany me to drink, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric did not speak, he knew his plan was seen by Du Lin But he didn't understand a bit. If the man knew at the outset that he was ready to leave and leave, why did he take 200,000 shares? If he doesn't know he is leaving, how can he send someone to stare at him? This very contradiction is also very unreasonable, exactly what Eric wants to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that he was full of confused eyes, Du Lin kindly explained to him a little, "From the time I saw the prospectus, I I feel that there is a problem, but you must be very strange. Why do I know that there is a problem and I have to plung it in. The reason is very simple, because I found your value.", Du Lin took out a cigarette box and took out a cigarette. Hearing, Eric didn't smoke. He smiled and said for himself. "It's good to not smoke. I agree that people don't smoke. This is not a good habit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; said that he took a deep breath and vomited his lips while vomiting out. "I was thinking, if you did not solve the funding problem through loans, but chose financing, not your company itself has a problem." It’s time for the loan. I asked Albert to spend two or three days investigating all of your assets. It can be said that all but the theaters in the fifth district are high-quality assets. Why not go to the loan? Bank for Such a customer is really very fond of it, then I thought about it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used his fingers to draw two circles next to his head, "Oh, I I thought, it must be that you plan to eat and drink and then borrow two dollars to run directly, so that even if investors ask to verify the integrity of East Coast Entertainment Company's property rights and equity, there will be no problem, this is a very Clever ideas, I have to say that you are doing well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for why I know that this is a trap and I have to step on it, maybe because of this paragraph. Time is too boring, and the trap like you can't trap me, so I think we can play a game."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest assured, I am not going to expose you or hurt you, but only if you need to be obedient. I will teach you a job, you just need to do it, you don't have to worry about other things." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric grabbed the glass with both hands and took a swig. His hair and breathing were entangled under the dampness of sweat. "What do I have to do?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled a little, "Do what you have been doing before, and bring in more people!"<br /><br />&nbsp Eric was shocked, and the body was just tense, and Ellis was a stick and pulled him directly to the floor with his chair. Looking at his painful expression, Buddha also went up to make up a foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't make any move that makes them feel impolite, we are civilized!", Doolin pulled the handcuffs out of the chest pocket, he rubbed I wiped a little blood on my face and looked at Ellis complaining. "When you start again, you will be bothering to flatten the cricket stick. Do you know how expensive my clothes are?", Ellis smiled slyly, and he gave up his mouth. "Put him up, how can we let our guests lie on the ground?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the forehead Eric, with a heel shoe print, lowered his head and his body shook slightly. He realized at this time that this was a group of madmen! They actually want him to continue to deceive, there is no doubt that all the scams will have a day to be exposed, and he will never have any good endings when the day arrives. Those who can take tens of thousands or even more of their shares will tear him up, but the money will not fall into his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can refuse!", Du Lin went to the bar and took the bottle for Eric and poured some wine again. "That tomorrow, Irian Daily The headline of the headline may have your photo. Maybe the city will also have some laws for you, such as not allowing you to go to the deep waters, or regularly clean up nearby sharks?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric chose to bow in the face of a strong desire for survival. "I want to know if I follow what you said..." Ellis is another stick in him. On the face, Eric's entire face was swollen. This time, the hemisphere stick in his hand was relatively level, and the blood did not splash onto Du Lin's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled the brown hair on Eric’s head and pulled it back, letting him see his eyes. “When you talk to the boss, you are this dross. Must you use honorific words, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric's swollen eyes became a seam. He ran out of his mouth with a blood in his mouth. "Understood, I understand!", he struggled twice, and Ellis loosened his hand and retired. Going to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must not have beaten him because he didn't use honorifics!", Buddha said with a certain face, "You just want to hit him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a shrug for Ellis, and he won’t admit it anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I do what you say, will you let me go?", Eric is really scared, he suspects if he is It is highly probable that the next two bastards will be killed alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his glass. "Why not? Mr. Eric, you have to understand, I am a businessman, I am not a robber, how can I Do you have such a heartbreaking thing? You work hard, my brothers Ellis and Dufoy will follow you these days. But please remember that if you intend to tear up the decisions we make now, Then they will tear you away like you tore up the agreement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But my face...", Eric pointed to his head "I'm afraid there is no way to see people in a short time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come, I heard that you are allergic to pollen, now it is just the flower season, these normal allergies The reaction is normal, isn't it?", he glanced at Jose. "Get a little anti-allergic medicine to our Mr. Eric, lest he be too painful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After letting Dufo and Ellis follow Eric to continue working for Du Lin, Doolin relaxes half-lying and sitting on the couch. His high hopes for Eric, I hope he can before the candle goes out of his life, to make more money for themselves. There is no doubt that he will definitely disappear after the last value of Eric is squeezed, otherwise the crazy investors really can't settle. After Eric’s disappearance, the bank will also start to get involved. In the face of such a complicated situation, even if the bank knows that these theaters can bring long-term profits, they will have to get out of the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make up for the loss, they will choose the auction, and this is a good opportunity for Dooling to swallow the entire East Coast company. The group of investors who have been defrauded of a lot of liquidity simply can't get more money to shoot East Coast Entertainment, but Du Lin has, and there are many. Buying someone else’s company for someone else’s money, and leaving millions of dollars in cash, this sale is really too difficult! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
