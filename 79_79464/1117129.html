			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus smiled for a while before he eased. He whispered and shook his head. "I never said that I would introduce the royal family." The princess knows you, but if you like, the children of the big aristocracy still have no problem." This sentence is not false. For the nobles, the child is not the burden of life, but a kind of wealth. In fact, from the primitive society, the word "hod" is used in families that can breed more children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the aristocratic family above the count, there will be a large number of children born in each generation. When wealth is no longer a stalker of fertility, something will happen. change. They will only think that there are not enough children, and there will never be too few children. If there is only one child, it is possible that this child will not become a qualified heir in the future. But if there are a hundred children, then there will be three or five suitable heirs to inherit the family's industry and carry it forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many such big families in the social circle of Magus. There are dozens of younger generations, so some homeowners can’t remember The names of all children, of course they will not show up. Throwing out a less important female descendant, in exchange for unimaginable gains, Maggs can already imagine, when he began to worry about Doolin's marriage, how many family owners will be tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is worth it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a guarantee to ensure that no matter what Doolin does, the end of the proceeds is the whole aristocracy. Of course, there may be some people who have some doubts. If Dolin turns around and doesn't recognize people when he gets what he wants, what should he do? In fact, such things have happened in history, and more than once. There are two consequences to doing so. The first consequence is that a group of vested dictators headed by Doolin’s successors will become a new aristocratic class. Simply put, when he makes all existing nobles unable to pose any threat to him. At the time, he may be the new ruler. But the "aristocratic class" will not be shaken, but only a group of beneficiaries have been changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the "class" itself, Du Lin will not only not cause damage, but will enhance the strength and hardness of the class, he will become the new maintenance of "class" Repeat the things that others have done to him until the new rule destroyer repeats his path, or another possibility - he better hopes that each of his heirs will not make mistakes. Even if it is a very small mistake, once his heirs make a mistake, the entire family will be destroyed. Even if this family has an extremely powerful power, it may not be possible to make it a thing of the past overnight, but it will eventually become a thing of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an invitation to experience different life invitations. Magus doesn't care about Du Lin's ambition and attitude. At least when he becomes a nobleman, he must stand with the nobles, otherwise the nobles will give him. Can take it when he is not strong enough. When he and the nobles stand together until they are strong, what is the difference between him and the nobility? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing for a while, Magus thought for a moment, "I will seriously consider it for you. In the last few days, you should not leave the Imperial Capital for the time being, just as you can Going to do your thing. Hellsman is a very capable bastard, you can trust him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not say "Why are you monitoring me?" Or showing anger and suppressing anger, his mood is not even a little bit fluctuating. When he decided to stand up, he knew that he would live in the spotlight one day and accept the malicious or kind eyes of the microscope to constantly scan himself, leaving himself with little privacy. And Hellsmann is a member of the Royal Policy Research Group. His identity and his work have exposed him to politicians like Magus. He only needs to reveal that he is working now and wants to recruit some talents. When you know, people who know will know that people who shouldn’t know can’t inquire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking of the election..." Magus smiled. "In fact, I hope that you can wait for the next general election. At that time, the situation will be much better. Of course, I know very well that I can't stop you from doing anything, and I can't stop it. I can only tell you that once you are successful, the next eight years may not be comfortable days!", There was a sympathetic look in Magus's eyes, which made Du Lin somewhat wrong, his heart sinking slightly, and faintly aware that some big mistakes might occur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus sighed. "Well, you can get out now. In the afternoon, remember to submit an application to the committee. I will be with the chairman." Say hello." He picked up his glasses and wiped the lens and re-attached it over the bridge of the nose, which meant that Doolin could leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin got up and succumbed to the ceremony, just happened to meet the butler to send tea in, smiled and thanked and took a sip and turned to leave. When I left, I took a small parcel from my wife’s hand and filled it with various pastries. When he left the Empire Avenue, he was thrown into the garbage bin as always. When Magus once again heard people say that he had lost those pastries, he couldn't help but lick two bastards, but then he laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus’s impression of Doolin is very good, quite good, the biggest regret is Du Lin’s birth problem, now the problem is solved, which makes him Feel a touch of relaxation. He is not afraid of those who have the ability to spoil, and the table is not too good for the table, he will always sit in his position, and others can not affect him. But if the other party's process before the table is like sitting down and not willing to sit, then it is really nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are not afraid of madness to eat, afraid that he is not a madman, still eating! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus took back the scattered thoughts. He looked at the book, but looked at the bright sunshine outside the window. After a few moments, he closed the book and made a phone call. Passed his sister's number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know a good young man..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is in one day Almost all the nobles of the imperial capital, Magus actually began to help people pimp after many years, this is simply unheard of the big news. According to the gossip, the wife of the emperor today, the empress of the empire, is the medium for Magus to protect the emperor. He introduced the daughter of a small aristocrat to the emperor and won the favor of the emperor. It is also because of this, Magus began to go from an ordinary Marquis heir to the highest political arena of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young people introduced by Maggs this time are really so good? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the palace director called in the evening, saying that there are still two princesses who have not found a suitable marriage object yet, let them try . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s market is really hot, he is not the same as those young people who don’t show up in the mountains, even if Magus is young. The ghost knows that he can finally get to this step. Before the acquisition of enough respectable achievements, the value of this marriage itself is not in the marriage of two people, but Du Lin is different, because he has already shown the dew. You can have such a broad and profound power and strength without the help of anyone. After the marriage, the nobles don’t even have to pay anything, they can harvest a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally this is Magisla’s...the media that is enough to illustrate the future of Dooling, so why give up this opportunity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just two days, Magus has drawn up a list of 28 people, and also removed some unqualified candidates, looking at this Maggs himself has a headache! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he also understands that for the nobility, the girls in the family should be used in such situations, this is the most correct way to use. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, when Margus’s movements alerted the aristocratic circle, Hellsmann got the news. The guy named by Magus as an old bastard is also a nobleman, a small aristocrat. He originally thought about how to make things beautiful for Du Lin’s promised money. I didn’t expect Du Lin to offer a valuable one. Remember to divide. With the support of the nobility and the acceptance of the new party, Du Lin’s chances of winning the election for the governor were almost nowhere. Now everyone knows that the New Party is putting the old party on the ground and rubbing it. When people think about their own interests, they often take the initiative to follow the strong side. This is nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
