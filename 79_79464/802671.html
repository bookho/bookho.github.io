			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garfield dismissed and got up and left, he just took a reason to go straight, and the next two people talked about things that he was not convenient to get involved. Every wise man will have self-control and will not listen to the secrets of others. The secret knows too much about this thing, and maybe one day it will shoot a bullet from an unexpected place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he left, the atmosphere was more harmonious, both of them were relaxed and there was not much strangeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the world that allows strangers to become brothers at the fastest speed, then it is the interest and common to let strangers become friends as quickly as possible. Interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven't asked you yet...", Du Lin wiped his shoulders, and Thomaston responded when he reported his rank. It was only at this time that he realized that his superiors had the advantage of upgrading him. If he is still a lieutenant colonel, maybe Du Lin will cross his direct and higher-level generals to negotiate, not with him. Du Lin smiled even more. "Colomnator Thomas, starting from the 1st of next month, our business will begin to fulfill. Before we cooperate, there are some things to say in advance, get on the table, right?"<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Thomas nodded. He was still a soldier in his bones. He was not as hypocritical as a businessman to say something else to test each other. He asked Du Lin directly. Something came out, "I can give you a guarantee, the transportation cost of each bottle of wine, the maximum will not exceed sixty-five points!", this Colonel Thomas still has the power to make a decision, because the price of this thing is talked about It’s just a matter of getting together. If you don’t talk, you can’t talk about it. You must have a result on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once there is a similar "study", the next time you talk about the price, the other party will have to press the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixty-five points? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin touched his chin, the price was acceptable, but it was unacceptable," Colonel Thomas, very embarrassed to ask, regardless of the price, the price is the same. Or do you have different prices depending on the itinerary?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Thomas stunned. "Of course not. This is just the cost of going to the farthest port." This includes factors such as the possibility that the return trip may be shorted. If the distance is a little closer, it will be almost 30 to 40."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded undecidedly and made a new request. "If I can, can I look at those ships?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, When do you want to see the boat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the meal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two soon In this special position, I ate a dinner, and when I shared it for an hour, Du Lin still paid 3,000. When they arrived at the beach, there was already a speedboat waiting for Matos. A short-haired young man stood straight in the driver's seat and looked at Colonel Thomas without squinting, as if he had not seen Du Lin at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Thomas and Doolin got on the boat, and he told me that the speedboat immediately went out of the port and moved quickly along the Irian coast to the south. It took about less than ten minutes to see another port, a military port. There are many warships anchored in the inner harbor. Some of the weapons are covered by canvas. Four white freighters are heard outside the port, and five "old ships" are obviously the same as the inner harbor warships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrolling navy turned a blind eye to Colonel Thomas Colonel, just as the young man driving a speedboat couldn’t see Du Lin, and they couldn’t see the speedboat. The two men boarded a modified ship with one of the warships. The entire cabin was almost empty, and the maintenance was very good. Some parts also had some butter that was not cleaned. Where is this retired warship, it is simply a new warship! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a new understanding of the guts of these navies. He initially thought that the Navy’s own operation of shipping was just a hidden rule, but it seems that this is no hidden rule. So simple, this is simply the illegal fruit of the red fruit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this can't blame Du Lin for being eccentric, the navy's situation is a bit special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attacks from the Federation during the Great Patriotic War basically occurred on land, and the attacks on the sea were not without, just compared to the crazy power on the ground. After the reservation, the two navies tentatively opened a few shots and then went home to rest. After the war, the New Party ruled. The first serious and blame was the attitude of the navy, and believed that the Navy did not shoulder the heavy responsibility of defending the empire and fighting the aggressors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this can’t blame the navy. In fact, both the empire and the federal side, except for those places where they can’t land, there are deep water ports and throats. A large number of shore guns, if you are not ready to sacrifice at any time, it is impossible to get in. Instead of wasting shells and crystals, and letting a large number of naval veterans die, it is better to turn around at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, Marques decided to cut the military expenses of the Navy and spend this part of the military on the improvement and research and development of new weapons and equipment. In addition to losing a large amount of military expenses each year, the navy's top management was also "removed" by some generals. These generals left the army, but their influence is still there. Many people even think that these generals are black pots for the entire navy. So under the high-level discussions of the Navy, they came up with an interesting plan - self-sufficiency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps they did run the maritime transport for this purpose at first, but soon the money became corrupted and the navy became a weapon for them to collect money. They have the funds that the Navy lacks in their hands, and the two sides quickly distinguish between the master and the slave from the peers. In addition, the active navy executives joined the feast of money, and the navy has basically been smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabinet of the new party is also very clear about this matter, but when they are clear, there is no way to deal with the navy. Either take the vast majority of naval generals and face the most likely overall change. This is not impossible. Even if it is not possible, the naval generals who are in danger will also create this atmosphere. The navy was forced to go to the opposite side with the empire, and those generals could protect themselves by this means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either indulge the navy, as long as they do not affect the empire’s policy implementation and political direction, as long as they do not vote for treason, let them be self-sufficient! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more cuts in the navy’s military expenses made the Navy more unscrupulous, so there was such a picture, blatantly transporting the empire’s warships to the rich. Supplies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are you satisfied with these boats?" Colonel Thomas patted the metal wall next to him, the dull percussion with a tremor The charm of the people, let people feel its solidity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is of course very satisfied. He shook hands with Colonel Thomas. "I don't think I have to keep watching. After you have the exact list of fees, We can sign the agreement!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Thomas slammed his heart and shook his right arm, holding the right arm of Doolin’s palm. "I will send you Go back, we will meet again at the latest two days later!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin left the military port after a contact with the speedboat, he thought of it at this time Things are far more important and more important than transporting those private wines. Obviously, the navy is a force that can be wooed. He will not naively think that as long as he spends money, the Navy can help him to do anything. If he spends money, he can always buy some naval "retirement" and "elimination", and it does not involve military. Secret thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example... weapons? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between non-military weapons and military weapons is too great. Military weapons are more powerful, more lethal, and have a longer range than others. The "toy guns" in them are much better. He has no weapons to carry the platform, and there is no latest war weapon, but he can change it himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tank in the dream is originally a "farm tractor", not to mention the conversion of a truck into a armed vehicle under the tremendous kinetic energy provided by the twine drive. It is not difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this requires first establishing appropriate cooperation with the Navy and then step by step to implement it concretely. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Du Lin left the military port, Colonel Thomas immediately went to the headquarters of the military port to meet the commander-in-chief of the navy stationed on the side of Ilyan, an imperial major. It is not unconditional for the Imperial Army to pay no hesitation to the Navy. That is, the Navy must remain loyal to the Empire and obey the empire’s fighting orders and orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Irian military port was abandoned, there was a small formation, a total of six warships ready to fight and eight training sessions. The ship stayed here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warships that Du Lin saw outside the military port were actually training ships. They transformed seven, leaving only one for training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "General, I am back." Thomas body knocked on the door straight and stood outside the door. With a "coming in", he pushed in, like the young man driving a speedboat, staring at his front without squinting. "I have met Mr. Doolin of Irian, he and I. Talking about a big business, starting next month, hundreds of thousands of bottles of wine will be transported to the Empire every month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Major General is a The old guy in his fifties doesn't look like a big man like the young general. He is not tall, a little thin, his hair is white and he is somewhat bald. His face is like a wrinkle with a knife and axe, and the wrinkles on the top of his forehead can catch the mosquitoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?", his voice was very loud, and there was a hint of accident in his voice. "Are you sure you are hundreds of thousands of bottles instead of tens of thousands?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
