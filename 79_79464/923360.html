			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the bodyguard sent Todd to the storage room and hollowed out a basket, loaded him in, and covered some debris outside the basket. He told Todd that if they were all killed, if he could escape, he hoped he could take care of his family and the children who had been supported by the bodyguard captain because they lost their father because of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd swears that he will definitely do it, then watched himself in a dark basket, watching the last light source in the vine gap disappear There is no trace, leaving only the boundless darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the bodyguard quickly climbed to the second floor. The bodyguards were basically on the second floor. There were only four people on the first floor, and they held the front and rear doors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the situation?", he took out a pack of cigarettes and distributed it. The veterans who participated in the Great Patriotic War will not be nervous in this situation. Because their nervousness was used up in the Great Patriotic War. At that time they faced the most elite army in the Federation. Every day, tens of thousands of Imperial Army were destroyed and they advanced to the empire's hinterland for dozens of kilometers. The thing they get the most is the hangtags of their comrades, and the constant loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they saw outside the trenches that the at least four-story weapon-mounted platform was madly pouring into the trenches, everyone was desperate, and One is easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s time to get rid of it, this is the only idea of ​​the bodyguard captain at the time. It is a pity that he did not guess the ending. The empire that had been beaten finally reacted. From the northern theater, a large number of troops were squashed and held in the position of the city of Otis, only one hundred and seventy-nine kilometers. People will be able to stand in the palace to declare the demise of an empire. But this one hundred and seventy-one kilometers has become the eternal pain of the federal people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They never have the chance to push forward even one kilometer, just as the imperial people were beaten, the federals were stunned by the inexplicable The long supply line became the fuse of the end of the war. They stopped in the city of Otis and lost the best chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the captains of the bodyguards faced the situation far less than the war. He took out the cigarettes just to calm the young people who had not experienced the war. Come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up a mirror and reflected the situation outside the house. Outside the yard, a group of guys wearing dark green covers were slowly advancing. He fixed the mirror on the window sill so that he could observe the situation at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said while smoking a cigarette: "It seems that these people and us are all a group." The captain of the bodyguard only smiled and waved his hand. "I don't mean that I am a group with them. I am talking about a profession. The people outside have the shadow of the soldiers. Is the Imperial Army so chaotic now? Even the military in service can Was pulled out to do private work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy with a sly face around him licked his nose and complained: "The army is not our army at that time." These women’s watches are raised for money. They have long wanted to learn the navy!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguard captain asked: “You said us How long can I hold on?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy with awkward face thought very seriously, “Maybe faster than last time!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, a little faster than the last war, they have no fire support, no weapons on the platform No snipers, no hand to observe a variety of ammunition without adequate support they held their ground. Here, they only have pistols in their hands, something that is useless in war! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the villa, Savi raised his hand and his friends were kneeling outside the wall of the villa. He made several gestures, and soon these people It spreads everywhere and looks for a dead corner to turn into the yard. The gate must not be able to go. Maybe there are several guns pointing at the door at this moment. To be safe, they chose the most common choice in textbooks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the action was taken, Du Lin told Savy, don’t fight for it, and perfect the task in the simplest and fastest way, they should made. Therefore, Savi did not consider the obvious naive way of attacking. He directly caused several smoke bombs to be thrown into the first and second floors of the villa. These catalysts with chemical elements reacted rapidly after the reaction with the twins. Spew a lot of irritating smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the second round of throwing began, this time they are not throwing smoke bombs, they are grenades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the first grenade fell on the ground, the captain of the bodyguard shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dull sound of the smoke bombs and the clear sound of the grenade are different. The purpose of the grenade is to kill, so it is made of cast iron. There are many split cutting lines on the outside to ensure that more fragments are created to kill the people around. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the fire swelled, and the second floor of the villa exploded with a huge explosion. Some flames spewed out from the broken windows, and they quickly disappear. Except for a few places that are ignited, there is not much flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the bodyguard licked the hoe and was full of dust. The irritating smog that had just appeared was blown away by the shock wave at the moment of the explosion, so that he could see the surrounding situation. . Several companions have lost their combat power, and the grenade is a reaction speed. If the moment of "ding" is heard, if you don't squat, you can imagine the consequences of flying around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has combat power here and he has only three people, and the other side is probably the same. Silently sighed, he glanced at his face, "I have escaped for so many years, still can't escape this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;疤脸知道What did he mean, the other person couldn’t help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't let these young bastards smack us, this round, it's us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Just after the explosion, it was calm for more than ten seconds. When the smoke bombs in the villa filled the whole villa again with thick smoke, suddenly three figures appeared from the smoke on the second floor. No need for anyone to direct, the young people stationed in the corners of the yard immediately pulled the trigger. The coherent gunshots and the rising steam made the bodyguard captain only want to swear. This group of women raised their rifles. How do you fight this battle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men fell out of the window after a few shots, and fell heavily on the ground. Savi personally made a few shots before they dragged them. Put it in the corner code. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd hiding in the storage room has been extremely nervous, especially when the explosion came, the whole villa was shaking, he was going crazy. And Du Lin is already crazy. Doesn't he know how to attack a mayor with such a super-sized heavy weapon? Is he not afraid of being sent to the gallows and hanged in front of tens of thousands of people? Doesn't he understand that there is something to discuss? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He regrets now, and should not provoke the madman, but regret is already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a series of gunshots, the surrounding area calmed down completely, and a lot of footsteps were heard around the floor, including the second floor, Todd. I held my breath and did not move. He could feel his heart as if he was about to jump out of his throat, and every heartbeat echoed like a huge thunder in his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"zhiya" a twisted whistling sound of wood, a light illuminates the storage room, he forced himself to be hibernating, even breathing slowed down A lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few swaying figures quickly turned over in the storage room, and all the hanging clothes were picked and dropped on the ground. These figures quickly left, which made Todd breathe a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After about three minutes, he heard someone talking outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I saw Todd fleeing back into the house, it is impossible not to be here, does this villa have a cellar..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Search again, search carefully, don't let go of any suspicious places..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minutes later, it appeared again Two shaking figures, they continue to search every corner of the storeroom until a ray of light illuminates from above Todd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrified Todd struggled not to get out of the basket, A young man slammed on his head with a butt, and he stood up honestly and walked out of the storage room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole villa has been destroyed, and there are 22 bodies in the yard, and Todd shakes. He was taken to the yard, and a man looked at him for a moment before he nodded. What he realized, immediately shouted, "I want to see Du Lin, I want to talk to Du Lin, Mr. Doolin must want to know what I will say!", his struggles and shouts lasted less than half a minute. Time, it becomes crying, "Don't kill me, I can give you everything about me, just ask you not to kill me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
