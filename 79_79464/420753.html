			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The price is too high!", Du Lin said that Mr. Richard almost took his eyes out and represented him in the city of Ternell. For the first time in the brand of wine, it was the first time I heard people say that the price he sold was too high! To know that those bars have heard that a bottle of high-quality almond wine is only 85 points, it has already decided the intention to buy, and no one has ever said that he sells expensive things! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the young and terrible Duolin, Richard is thinking about whether this young child is really doing business or is idle. Find yourself playing. Just as he was about to finish this conversation, which was not very pleasant, Du Lin’s words made him leave the buttocks of the chair and fell back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just extended a finger and said to him very seriously, "Six months, 10,000 bottles!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each successful businessman can estimate how much income he can earn and how much gross profit he has in the shortest possible time. Ten thousand bottles are eight thousand five hundred dollars, of which almost 30% of the profits, this deal less said that they can fall into the pocket of 2,500! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than two thousand five hundred? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said more or not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the big capitalists, 2,500 is just the price of a luxury car, but it is the money they need to spend a year to support their lover, nothing more than After they gambled in a game, they gave the chips to the class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two thousand and five hundred for these big capitalists, can't be considered as money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for ordinary people, this is a money that takes twenty years to eat, not drink, not wear, and can save. But maybe when they saved 2,500, 2,500 were not the previous 2,500. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Richard, 2,500 is a business that will make him comfortable for a while! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he believes that if he can maintain this sale, it will be the most successful sale in his life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Du Lin has already painted a big cake for him. If the city of Tener can maintain such a scale, how big can the entire Yaoxing Empire be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t think! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t had time to ask if Doolin needs this million bottles of Almond wine, and he plans to give a little price, Du Lin is like As he did before, he said first, "I must tell the truth, this is the basis of the integrity of businessmen. Before I talked with you, I also had another four suppliers of alcohol. There are also foreign and domestic. In their offer, you and your moon card do not take any advantage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard smiled quietly, but in my heart Knocked up the drum. This sale is very important to him. The moon card is inexplicably unable to expand the market in the Yaoxing Empire. The big boss of the Freedom Federation has been angered. If he can make this sale, he will lose the profit. It is also possible to get the goods at a lower price. At the same time, if his channels are integrated into the company, he will also change from an agent to a management of the company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Almonds are strictly costing around 60, plus the free trade of the commercial department and the major chambers of commerce, they intend to shine The Star Empire became a dumping ground for free federal goods, destroying the light industry and handicrafts of the Yaoxing Empire with more affordable goods, causing the collapse of the economic system of the Yaoxing Empire. So even if he sold it to the young man called Doolin at a cost of sixty, Richard could make money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Freewealth has subsidies, the more you sell, the more subsidies you have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, personal income, on the one hand, it also involves the future vision. Considering how long it has not lasted, Richard’s psychological price will come out, 60 Five points. He believes that under the premise of the same quality, no one will be cheaper than his price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the psychological price is the psychological price. If you can get a higher price, then he smiles and asks: "I don't know if someone else will open it for you." How much the price, so that you will think that my thing can be described with the word 'expensive'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin spread his hands to reveal a slightly regrettable expression As if he had decided to give up the trade that the two sides might have, he vomited a sigh of relief. "There are 40 and 50, and the maximum is no more than 62."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the price, Richard felt a burst of pain. He smiled bitterly. "If I put the price in this grade, I can't make any money. And Mr. Doolin should understand that in quality. The moon brand almond wine definitely exceeds the drinks provided by the merchants you are in contact with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But sir, people may not be able to distinguish between their tongues and their mouths. What is the difference between once or once? Of course, as you said, quality is really important, but the audience is more important. Girls don’t like to drink a little bit of bitterness, only adult males. Like. We can't give up such a huge market for girls and young people, choose a product with a higher price and a smaller hand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood up, Finished out the clothes and reached out. "Although I very much hope that I can work with you to distribute this better quality drink, but you know, whether it is the price or the audience, even if any point can meet my requirements, I You can be the master to sign an agreement with you. But you see, we still have a lot of differences, and have delayed your time, I am very sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard does not Standing too reluctantly, reaching out and holding Du Lin, he wanted to say that I could cut the price, but he knew that it was not the best time to say this. Just shouting a price that is considered too high, and then actively lowering the price, will give people the illusion that they are liar. The tone is now spoken, it is better to wait, wait a couple of days to contact Du Lin, but it seems more sincere. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Du Lin left, Richard arranged to investigate Duolin’s company and his ability to pay while preparing to mobilize merchandise from the Freedom Federation. There are only more than 2,000 bottles in the warehouse here, and he came with him last year, and has not sold out yet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard was a little farther away, Graf touched his head and looked at the expression he was afraid to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to ask?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grafton laughed, "I really want to buy one." Millions of bottles? We don't have that much money, and Mr. Heidler said that the money behind is also given in batches, I am afraid it is too late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin from the cigarette case Out of a complete cigarette, a 12-point box of male lion cigarettes, took a sip on the mouth, spit a light, like a smile and looked at the bright sunshine, "sometimes not necessarily buy things To pay, even they have to give us money!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf has a slap in the face, not only paying for it but also making money? What is this way? There was a hint of coolness in my heart, and there was a slight change in the eyes of Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin knows that it is impossible to talk to Graf, who has muscles in his mind, and has not continued to say it for a long time. Then they went to see four suppliers. The process is not much different from the process of talking with Richard. In a word, even if someone sells a price of fifty-one bottles, Du Lin is still too expensive to frown. Perhaps after an interview with Richard, he gradually found a little feeling, so he increased the number of 10,000 bottles to 50,000 bottles a year! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If 10,000 bottles can still keep Richard a little decent, make yourself look like a successful businessman. Then 50,000 bottles will make the other four suppliers become the dogs that are shaking their tails and turning around. This is definitely a business that can be sold for one year, even if you break your head, you must grab it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin Ma non-stop painted these pies for these suppliers, and did not come home at night, in a small restaurant on the side of the road and Graf Richard was suddenly appearing while eating corn soup and grilled meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can't blame him. He arranged for his company to investigate Du Lin's company and watch him see if he had talked about other suppliers. When his men told him that he accidentally accidentally heard that Du Lin and others were 50,000 bottles a year's supply request, Richard couldn't sit still. He didn't know what it meant to be a late change, but the instinct of the businessman told him that if he didn't take the initiative, perhaps the big fish would slip away from his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some strange Du Lin would have finished eating in an ordinary small restaurant, Richard did not think much. Now the situation in the Yaoxing Empire is still very chaotic. Turner is another small city in the border. A few luxury restaurants are not allowed to enter, but only open to local celebrities. So Richard quickly made up for it and found a reasonable excuse for Du Lin’s somewhat uncomfortable behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pretends to be a coincidence, the surprise on his face, even if Graf is a little embarrassed, "I am so smart, can I sit down?"林 < br br 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜 杜<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
