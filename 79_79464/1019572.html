			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people can face death with ease? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, many people can do it, as long as they have a firm belief and are eager for new life, then death is nothing but an eternal medal for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s obvious that this agent from the Security Council can’t do this. He doesn’t really believe in the old guy, at least in the world he knows. There is no sacredness in heaven, and the so-called miracles only appear in the records of some churches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a complete family, and a child who is about to be born. He even said it to the vice chair. After this stalking back, After a week of leave, he will go back to the moment when the most sacred life will come to this world. He will love his children, his wife, maybe more children, and then slowly accompany them to get older, calmly and finish their life may not be dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not thought about it, he will die in the mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, don’t be kidding, he’s a member of the Security Council, but it’s a special department that cleans up all possible threats to national security and institutions. Only when they kill, when others dare to kill them casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered what his companion had said before he left the room—he should go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence is the best way to disguise your inner heart. As long as you don’t open others, you don’t know if your heart is as strong as it seems, or it has already collapsed. Looking at the flames on the lighter in the hands of Buddha, watching the move to throw out, he could not restrain the thought of what Du Lin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that when a person’s body temperature drops to a certain level, even if it is burned by fire, it will not feel pain. This sentence seems to make a point. . It’s too long to play in the snow in winter, and it’s numb after feeling the pain in both hands. Whether it's a colder stimuli or a warmer place, there is no feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He started thinking about a problem, really doesn't hurt? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it doesn't hurt, perhaps this sacrifice is a good choice, although his family will not be the wife of the hero's parents and heroes, but they can enjoy more benefits from the empire, confirmed from his death. From that moment on, his family's future life does not require him to worry, his children will receive the best education, and his wife does not need to worry about the cost of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But... why are you not willing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong not willing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told himself that I don’t want to die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said..." His eyes looked at Doolin's feet with some evasiveness. "My name is Eric, the rank of Lieutenant of the Imperial Security Commission. This time we came to the western region to investigate the cause of the turmoil in the west and prevent the turmoil. According to the request and guidance of the Vice-President, we have made Mr. Doolin the primary goal and monitored your living and tried to find the west. The real reason for the turmoil. This is why my colleague and my colleague appeared here. I didn't lie, I promise!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lighter in the hands of Dufo was his After receiving it, the flames became a past tense, which made Eric breathe a sigh of relief and felt an unspeakable regret. He regrets why he is so weak, and he regrets why he is so unbearable, even death will make him afraid to breathe. He has lived up to a lot of things, including himself. He betrayed his beliefs and betrayed his future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there was a relief in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin licked his mouth and pointed at him with a hand holding a cigarette. "Get him down, put on his clothes and some heat." Drink, I have other things to talk to Eric Lieutenant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a child rushed from behind everyone, he ran To a middle-aged person with a toe on the tip of the middle-aged man said something, the middle-aged man praised the boy unexpectedly, and then walked to Doolin to convey the news that the child had just sent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were seven gold diggers who entered the town. They entered the town in three batches and were now swaying on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wat Xiazhen can also see gold diggers from time to time, but most of these gold diggers are Lone Rangers. There are no mineral deposits explored nearby, nor is it a traffic artery, except that there is a train station that allows trains to stay here slightly. With a supplement and replenishment, the gold digger can't find any benefit here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grab the village? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this is a way to get rich, but they have to get at least a thousand or more, or more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin asked the middle-aged to tell the Guars in the town, stare at the group, if they leave soon, if they just ask Whatever, let them "stay" down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of others, Eric put on his clothes, holding a somewhat hot iron cup and entering the room behind Doolin. In the room, only Du Lin and his two people were kept outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Eric, I apologize to you for all the encounters you have just received.", Du Lin’s first sentence made Eric somewhat ignorant. He did not understand what Du Lin wanted to do. He was so scared that he could not sit still with his chair and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his hand and pressed down. "Don't be nervous, sit down, so our communication will be normal, and I don't like to look up and people." "I don't know what Du Lin's words worked. Eric sat back in the chair. Du Lin handed him a cigarette and smiled and said, "Hey, I am not a hard person. The person I get along with, I am not a person who belongs to me completely. I have taken on the future and expectations of many people on my shoulders. I can't leave these things alone. Others are willing to believe what you said and give If you have enough trust, then you should not disappoint these trusts, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric took a sip... he looked down At a glance, I am not sure what this thing is. It's a bit like the taste of coffee, but it's more bitter and more mellow. This is something called a tree grape, which is more common locally. People cut the tree grapes and took out the fruits. After simple processing and baking, they became a drink for their bitterness. They called this black coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly looked up at Dulin’s chest, and he dared not look directly at Doolin’s eyes. “Yes, Mr. Doolin. You do It’s right!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was very satisfied with his answer. "It seems that we have found a direction that both sides can understand, so in order to keep myself in a safe situation, it is inevitable that there will be malicious or potentially malicious things to the outside world. Sensitive, this is why I hope you can forgive me.” After getting a positive response from Eric, the atmosphere in the room became more relaxed. “Are you married?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The awkward problem made Eric, who felt extraordinarily exhausted, suddenly shake, and the relatively hot black coffee in his hand spilled on the back of his hand. He didn’t feel the pain. "What do you mean by?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just our chat, really, with my ability, knowing your name and your work After the place, it is very easy to find all your information. Your parents, your loved ones, your wife, your children, even if you have a dog, the name of the dog can be easily I know. So this is just a Chat, we should put down our prejudice and say something normal. Don’t you want to talk to me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric is silent, Du Lin has no Push him, just smile at him. After about a minute, Eric nodded. "Yes, I am married, and I will have my first child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin The expression is very vivid. "Wow, this is the first good news I have heard today. You must love your wife and family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Rick nodded. "Yes, I love them more than everything." As Du Lin said, no matter what he hides, Du Lin can find his information through various channels. Instead of reversing the situation that would have begun to improve because of such things, it would be better to follow Du Lin’s words, and these ordinary dialogues and the family issues he was most concerned about, he gradually relaxed a lot, not so nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also have family, I am like you, love them more than everything. So, I want to give them the best things in the world, even if they want To the sun, one day I will use a thing that can fly to the sky to pick up the corner of the sun and give it to them." Du Lin watched Eric’s cigarettes exhausted and gave him another one. Talk about you, busy work? What is the salary? Oh, I don't want to find out what you have done, just like just now, just chatting, you are very curious when I am."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
