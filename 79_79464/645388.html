			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or, we slaughtered him!", the tone of the Buddha is somewhat sensible, this may be the best way he can think of now, that is, slaughter The mayor. When the mayor dies, everything will end. No one will continue to look for Jon, and no one will pose any threat to his fellow countrymen. But is it so simple? Really can solve all the problems as long as the assassination of the mayor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, things are not so simple, if a politician is killed, what is the first thought? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black screen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;****! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that an old party member or a city mayor died of an inexplicable assassination - assuming that both Buddha and other friends can cross the defense The line of defense and quietly kills the mayor like the legendary assassination god, Buddhism, and then, without disturbing anyone, the horse’s return to the same path is also undiscovered, and there is no meaningful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of important politicians of the old party will make the old party unquestionably define this as a "political assassination" for these qualified politicians who are still alive. For example, living alone may have many uses, but dying is more useful because people tend to sympathize with the "weak." By taking advantage of this so-called political incident, attacking the new party politically and splashing the dirty water of the new party, the new party will definitely increase the death of the mayor, whether it is to elute suspects or find out who is framing them. Investigation of the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the New Party’s old party worked together, plus one politician, businessman, and tycoon who planned to speculate in this incident, Du Lin I don't doubt that I can be betrayed anytime, anywhere. The fellowship and the Oriental Star will become the dust under the wheel of history and will be used to bury the insignificant truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s even more likely that our mayor is waiting for “Jon and his accomplices” to jump over the wall so that he can take the most out of it. Political benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you want to be safe in this round of tsunami, you have to choose the most positive way - politics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Doolin's long dream, the back of his eyes touched many big people. These big characters have a characteristic, that is, they have a very strong target and directivity. In the words of the merchants, they are the typical representatives of the unprofitable early days. In the words of the big brothers, they have high political consciousness and ambition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pocket of the pocket, Du Lin decided to contact the guy named Xien, who felt that he should talk to Xiu En. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They glanced at him all at once, "Change clothes, go with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The days without a phone call are not good, and even the days when you have a phone call are just as bad. It is said that there is already a telephone network in the capital and other places, but it is still relatively primitive and needs to be transferred through the switch. In this process, the content of the call is not safe, can be monitored and recorded, so people are more loyal to the traditional way of private communication, that is, meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of Doolin and Schoen is located at the northern pier of the city of Tener. The pier is built on the tributary of the Agate River. The draught is not very deep. Such a city that relies mainly on rail transport is enough. Every night after the darkness of the night, the workers on the dock will gradually leave, and the empty and dark dock seems to give a feeling of fear. Things that are darker than the night are hidden under the night, as if they have entered a certain fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the moonlight, Du Lin sat alone on the bench at Pier 2, Pier No. 2, and both were hidden in the dark, both of them Bring a gun, just in case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About nine o'clock, Doolin had felt that some cold, a drunkard with a bottle in his hand staggered. Du Lin put his hand into his pocket with some vigilance. The dock is not like a station. Basically, it is impossible to load any cargo at night, so it is difficult to see even a ghost on the dock when it is off work, plus the remote north side. Few people will come here at this time. Is this person a Xiun? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You came some early!", Du Lin had not had time to speak out, the drunkard spoke first, and he stumbled and sat next to Du Lin. On the bench, he looked up and vomited. The vomit exuded an unbearable sour smell. Du Lin covered his mouth and nose and sat on another bench. When he was almost squirmed, he took out his handkerchief and wiped his mouth and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
