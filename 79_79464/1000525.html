			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last time I forgot to ask, what is the atmosphere of the school?", Du Lin, this is nothing to look for, his hand has been pressed in Fu Lei Na's calf. It may be because there is too much ambiguous potential information in the process of playing chess with Magus today, and he still has a little pressure in his heart. Especially when Magus asked him if he wanted to serve in the West, his pressure was very great at that moment. What he needs now is relaxation and relaxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want to warm up in the house in winter, the fireplace is the easiest way, in addition to the more extravagant way, for example As a source of heat, twins can make a room warm quickly. None of these people who can live in the Oak Bay villa area are poor. The crystals that burned a few dollars a day or more for a few dollars are not in the scope of their consideration. It is better to consider the value is not worth considering. More valuable things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the temperature in the winter villa has been maintained at about 28 degrees, which is just the kind of cold and hot temperature, do not need to wear too much clothes. Freina seems to have taken a shower, and her body has a unique fragrance of shower gel. If this smell smells in a daily necessities store, it may feel very general, and it may even make some people feel a little sick or disgusting. However, after being used on people, the taste is obviously a lot lighter and it has become better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While groping for Freena’s calf, Du Lin lamented the passage of time and unconsciously left Tener for several years. He just arrived at Te Nai. He was only sixteen years old. Now he is already twenty-one. When he is busy with all the things in his hands, he is almost twenty-five years old and even twenty-seven years old. Time is really urgent. I will never stop a person’s hasty pace. Even the gods are killed by time in the long river of the years. How can humans last for a long time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can’t light the flash of the entire sky in such a long time, he will guilty, and he gave him life to the gods. Miracle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The current series is pretty funny, it seems that the screenwriters are still those who used to, are you so confident in giving these people to her?", laughter on TV One by one, some are indeed very vulgar as the commentators say, but the more vulgar things, the easier it is for the general public to find common pleasure, which is part of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opera really looks good, but not everyone can read and understand. It is possible that those big people don't like to watch operas, but they just want to prove that they are "civilized people", so they have to sit in the theater and smile and enjoy the torture. Just like some nobles drink milk and add rosemary powder and some spices, the taste is weird like the milk that the calf spits out of the stomach. This is not the food that ordinary people can "enjoy", but the nobles drink. I said yes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin came back and grinned. He reached out and separated the fingers as much as possible. "See?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena was a bit inexplicable, she looked at it for a while, and grabbed Du Lin’s hand and looked over it for a while, asking: “What have you seen? You have What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can't you feel it? Time slipped away from my palm, there is no such thing in the world. Now you think these things are great, but you will understand how long it will take, the past glory can't light up tomorrow's midnight..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this a line? It seems very esoteric, what does it mean?", Freina is still confused, she is a bit confused about what Du Lin is saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin gently pushed her, she immediately understood, kneeling on the ground and leaning forward on the coffee table, continue to concentrate on watching the screen The picture on the scene makes people laugh and laugh, and laughs from time to time. Just a little laughter, it seems to be mixed with some strange accents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the three days, Doolin was hiding in Oak Bay and did not go out. The public opinion outside became more and more intense, and various "conspiracy theories" emerged endlessly. Of course, he will not always say that he is good like a fool. He is a victim and he is a weak person. He hired a lot of newspapers to become his enemy, and tried his best to pour dirty water on him. Even some small newspapers gave Doolin a list of nine unforgivable guilts, saying that when Doolin was assassinated, the people chose. The doctrine tempered the little newspaper fire - but it was quickly smashed by some people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the general public lost their eyes in the various "truths" that are countless in society, how would they make choices? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people will tell them the true truth, these people are called "social activists", for example, Mrs. Vivian is one active in Cannes Very famous feminist social activist. Such people are more in the emperor. After all, there are more people in the imperial capital who can help them. Any "aid" will change their current life, both material and political. Pursue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why is Mr. Doolin persecuted?” A guy who looked very clean and tidy and looked upright dressed in a very decent dress stood in an open place in the park and loudly conveyed his theory to the people around him. He raised his arm and pointed at the sky and said loudly: "Because Mr. Doolin is a representative of the minority, there have been some problems in our society that need to be solved urgently. Racial discrimination and class discrimination are getting worse. Mr. Donald, Cape The ancestors of the family, they are all nobles, all of them are Ogildinians. These nobles not only look down on our ordinary people, but also look down on the Guars represented by Mr. Doolin."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the help of Mr. Doolin, the life of the residents of Otis has been greatly improved, which has hurt the interests of these nobles. They cannot continue to devour and exploit us with their evil means. Such people, so they hate Mr. Doolin and use despicable means. We may not be able to help Mr. Doolin get rid of the current dilemma, but we There are things that I can do. From today, from now on, we strive to resist and refuse to buy all the products of the hymn consortium..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This gentleman, who is full of sense of justice and looks like a good person, is a social activist. He received 1,500 pieces of assistance from an anonymous account. He hopes that he can at least follow his own in public. "Wish" discusses the relationship between Mr. Doolin and the nobility. This apparently biased requirement is what all social activists like most, not only can get a lot of money, but also enable more people to become their own believers and continue to expand their influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day they can represent a certain group of people to become recognized cultural people, and they are social ethics consciences for the advancement of society, he will attack on behalf of justice Ugly, he is the embodiment of justice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freina and Doolin, who were dragging Dulin out in the morning, stayed by the park. This is already the third one, she I couldn't help but ask, "How many people have you invited? Is their influence really so big?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled, no To answer this question, I will continue to move forward. These people are all Kevin to help him find, as a lawyer who can master the key to victory outside the courtroom, he has mastered a lot of things. A total of less than 150,000 spent, but invited more than 60 "social activists" with certain influence to create momentum for Du Lin. Look at those who stand by and concentrate on listening to the activist's instilling ideas. Most of them are the bottom of some society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
