			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, when Doolin waited for Adams to complete the patent registration for him in the hall of the Patent Office, the local president came in from the outside, He said something about investigating Xi Nen in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who stalked this morning, after Xiu En left, intercepted the tramps in the three parks on the way, and learned from their mouths that Xiuen was More than a month ago. When he came, he was not so lonely. He learned that Xiu En was coming to his former boss, but his boss is now being investigated for duty crimes. He spent his money here and no face to see him. The family, then joined the ranks of street friends, mixed with their tramps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the day, Xiu En will go to the station to beg, the traffic there is always large, and not far from the park, everyone will gather in the evening Eat and drink together, then wait for the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no abnormality in the mouth of these tramps, so they immediately sent the information back and let Du Lin know the first time. These things. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is sitting on the waiting bench at the moment and looking at today’s Imperial Daily. The front page headlines cover the former Imperial Railway Tycoon. Mr. Colliers finally wakes up magically after his family chooses to give up treatment, and there are no sequelae and complications. Even the medical group's expert group said it was a miracle. Mr. Colliers, who just woke up, returned the family that had fallen apart to his own hands, and with very strong means and attitude, deprived 17 family shareholders of their shares and removed four heirs with inheritance power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reporter of the Imperial Daily believes that Mr. Collier’s awakening indicates that the revived giant will cut off the federal builders led by the joint construction of the empire. "Pro- abuse." During Mr. Colliers' coma, the joint construction workers have built and realized the east-west traffic of the city of Otis, and also built the railway construction with a total construction length of not less than 30,000 kilometers. Other builders from the Federation have cooperated with each other and have already squandered the construction industry market to a considerable extent in the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it’s time to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still some embarrassment in Mr. Colliers’s face in the newspaper. It seems that the physical condition is still not optimistic, and of course it is. Anyone who has been lying in a hospital bed for more than a year without any disease, watching a little collapse of the empire he built, will certainly not be happy. Moreover, the space for restricted activities is also quite small, lacking the opportunity for sports. Mr. Colliers' physical condition is not as exaggerated as the newspaper said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all this is worthwhile. As one of the participants in the harvesting plan, a little effort is now to bring the company into the federal hinterland and to make the business federal in the near future. A little loss at this time can make up for it later, and also let Colliers see the ugly face of these relatives. Less than a week after I lie down, my wife, children, brothers and sisters began to think about how to dismember the achievements of generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for him to sign a new legally valid will, if it’s not his coma, if...he may have been killed by these people It is. He was very sad when he thought of it. The only thing that made him feel a little relieved was his pair of illegitimate twin brothers and sisters. In the whole process of vying for family property, only the twins did nothing. As soon as nothing happened, they went to school on time, went to school on time, and came to see him on time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colliers has made a decision that 66% of all property will belong to the twin brothers and sisters, another percent Twenty-four percent of the thirty-four will be donated to social charities without compensation, and another 14 percent will be distributed to the monks, although that is an amazing asset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the last word of this report, Du Lin closed his eyes, and the huge plan was constantly verified in his mind, two years, two A thriving federation will know what is fear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After about ten minutes, Du Lin threw the newspaper aside and told him: "Continue to arrange people to stare at him, don't alarm him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin didn’t think that he could see Xiun in this time, but he didn’t even think about it. In such an occasion, it’s inevitable that he’s in his heart. A trace of doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so smart? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just came out of the station to meet Xiun? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is so mixed now? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that Doolin’s understanding of Xiu’en far exceeds Xi’an’s understanding of Du Lin’s understanding. After Du Lin’s settlement in Irian’s, he’s investigated it. The bottom of the fine, for this also spent 7 thousand five hundred as the cost of purchasing intelligence. The reason why Doolin would do this is because Xiu En once said in a few words that he has a boss who is very optimistic about him. He wants to put a hole in the sky in Tyne and want to go back. On the side of the Imperial Capital, continue to be an agent of the SAR General Investigation Bureau and participate in an important case investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Xiun also said that he was taken to Tern or his boss to protect him, otherwise he might directly lose his job and be tried by law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Kevin Doolin, it’s common that the identity of Xiu’an was directly dismissed before he was mistaken, often without authorization. Government officials conducted a private investigation. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After combining a lot of clues, Du Lin thinks that the boss of Xiuen may also have the ability to fish out Xiu En, so let people check it out. The result was not bad. Sheen himself fell a dog in the toilet and smashed it into his boss, leaving his boss troublesome. Since then, Du Lin has not paid attention to the situation of Xiu En, but everything that happened yesterday made him feel very embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he and his fellow countrymen are beginning to enter a transitional period. This is an extremely important moment and cannot make a small mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, a young man who appeared to have a "guanwei" came to the patent office, he went straight upstairs, about five minutes later he left. Not long after, Adams walked downstairs with a smile and smiled and sat next to Du Lin with a file. "Things have been done, one hundred years of patent rights, I suggest that people re-enact a set. Put it here, when you need to use legal means to protect your rights, just give us a call."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded Without speaking, he took the file and opened it directly to several places where he needed to sign. In these places, he not only saw the chapter of the patent office, the chapter of the law firm, but also the two official seals of the Imperial Ministry of Justice. When he looked up at Adams, Adams looked at the empty hall and sat around Doolin to explain. "Because there is no clear legal clause to refuse us to register such a patent, they naturally have no way to stop us. But At the same time, there was not enough to support our registration, so I contacted the friends of the Ministry of Justice and found two outstanding officials who were willing to try to improve the Imperial Patent Law. We can pass here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doing a good job!", Du Lin, who was the one who took the initiative to solve the problem, never praised himself. He handed the file to the branch president here, and then Asked, "How much do I have to pay, including the registration fee on the federal side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adams’s face suddenly showed an irresistible smile, he was slightly Looking down, it is very humble. "Mr. Du Lin, it is my pleasure to serve you. I should not ask for more fees, and I don't need to delay my registration for a patent."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
