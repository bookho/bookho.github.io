			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After lunch, Brest’s people entered the hotel, including the drunkard who lived opposite the hotel. There was a bag on his head, and his eyes were a little blue, which was two times when he wanted to challenge Brest's patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the drunkard, what happened to him today was greatly hurt. The house he built with his wife was burned, and all the savings were He became ashes, and even his favorite queen puppet was accidentally broken. He felt that there was nothing that would hurt him more. He had no future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he plans to join. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to rob? Take me one, I know the situation of most people here, the most wealthy person in town is the sheriff, I I heard that he hid a gold bar in an iron box of his own security office, which is worth at least 500! Also, there is a hotel on the way to the west of the town. The boss is very rich, at least three or four hundred. Just give her fifty, she will help you take a shower, you understand? Help you bathe!", the drunkard thinks this is an opportunity, anyway, nothing is gone, it is better to follow this group of people to rob, say Uncertainly your own life will take another path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unfortunately, Brest’s answer to him was two punches, so he didn’t know what he was wrong. Not only was it blocked, but it was tied up and stuffed under the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two rooms on the third floor are not Du Lin, 303 is a young couple, 305 lives an old man, the only possibility is 203 The room was gone, no one came out at noon.” Brest was sharing his intelligence with his companions. He had a room on the second and third floors, and then stood at the window at the end of the corridor. Smoking on the side, as long as there are people in these rooms, they will definitely come out to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brest thinks that Doolin can’t possibly know that they have come and live in the hotel where he lives. Once Du Lin was discovered, they would choose to kidnap at night and then leave the town in the night. When the money is ready, Du Lin will be sent to see God. With a lot of money, they will soon become important figures in the Freedom Front. Even if they don't return to the Freedom Front, the money they get from Doolin is enough for them to spend their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the federal price is not high, they may be able to go to the federal side to start a new life journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brest’s finger clicked on the elbow-pressed table, and said with certainty: “If there is no accident, Doolin must live at No. 203. In the room, my plan was to take him away with the people around him without disturbing the local sheriff. Just leave him alone in the wild." At this time, someone asked how to bring Du Lin Go, Brest replied without thinking: "Of course it is to force him, do you want to ask him to take the initiative to leave with us?", said he waved his hand, "I know what you want to say, I will arrange you now. The task."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, continue to stare at the corridor on the second floor. If Doolin comes out, knock on the door. If he doesn't come out, you don't have to go." What to do to alarm him, he certainly won't show up easily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, get a carriage, buy or rent, go to the place where there are forages nearby Buy a few bales of forage, wait for us to grab Du Lin and then stuff him into the forage and leave the town, even the sheriff or There will be no patrols by the militia at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, go close to the boss, check if there are spare keys, if any, 203 The spare key was stolen. If not, I will use the door of my room to do the experiment and see how I can open the door without making a sound. But I believe that there will be a spare key in the boss, and we only took one!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calling...Crying..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brest suddenly closed his mouth, and the seven people in the room looked at the only bed in the room. Their eyes seemed to be able to penetrate the bed and see the snoring under the bed. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to kill him?", one person asked, "It is dangerous to keep him. He has seen our looks and may sell us to The sheriff, it’s better to kill him without any discovery.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a policy in the West that anyone can provide a portrait of the perpetrator and can take it At the beginning of the year, many people made some so-called portraits to get bounty. In the end, they found that a wanted man often had several to a dozen faces, those wanted. Even more wanted monks even have dozens of different portraits, which brings great trouble to arresting wanted criminals. Later, the western government decided to postpone the payment of the reward, and added a penalty system, ranging from five to five hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has caused many people who want to be cheap, to give up and make money by selling portraits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brest thought for a moment and shook his head. "He still has some use, and he takes him with him when he walks."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in the camp is also quite clear, and it seems that there is no big problem at present, but he knows that the next organization needs a large-scale attack to solve a potential problem. Crisis - supply. Many places have refused to provide resupply, and large-scale or small-scale transactions have been temporarily suspended, which has caused the first crisis of the Freedom Front. If they can't solve the problem of replenishment, they will not die, but many people will choose to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the future of an organization that can't afford to eat? Everyone participating in the Freedom Front is not for the high ideals of shit, but to make money and enjoy life. But if these things are not available, the group of people who are not slaves like Brest will leave. Maybe they will sell the free front to the state government or the military, at least from there. They can make a fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if there is a person who knows a lot about the town of Washu, perhaps they can transfer the target of the looting from the mining area to the town. As long as they can win the town, the supply in the town is enough for them to not need to consider the supply problem within three months. After three months, the situation may not be as tense as it is now. At that time, it is a good time for them to show their talents. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back Brest is still ready to say something, but forgets what he was going to say, he opened his mouth, "Just like this, according to plan Acting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time there was a sudden sound of footsteps on the stairs. This old wooden house is not very soundproof, sometimes on the third floor. After the couple entered the night, the sound of how humans originated was able to be heard by the boss on the first floor. The heavy footsteps made Brest's expression slightly moving. He immediately stood up and opened the door, and went out. At the same time, he took out a pack of cigarettes and took a sip at the window at the end of the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watched the three people walk up the hallway, and one of them looked at him again, his eyes staying on his face for a few seconds before moving away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the three people seems to be drunk, not even walking, and the people around him are still laughing at how much he is drunk without drinking. Brest most hates people who can't drink alcohol or drink alcohol. At the same time, Brest also noticed that they were holding two boxes for the food, and the food inside made him smile. He didn't guess, there were people in the room without a little bit of noise, and there were two others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling must be inside. He watched those people enter the 203 and waited for a while in the hallway. One of the three people left, and Du Lin did not leave. He annihilated the cigarette butt and turned to lie on the window sill, watching the man go to the distance before returning to the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin is still in the room, there are at least three people in it, and now act according to the plan, all move!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the person who arranged to go close to the boss came back. His expression was a bit strange. "The boss is not there, the player is on, and I found the spare key of 203 from the counter." He also took out a key with a number plate and showed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brest said in disappointment: "Maybe the guy went to the bathroom, or went to eat, don't care for him, stare at the movement of 203, later It’s to continue the day when there’s not a day, or to spend a lot of money, just tonight!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in the room is exposed Full of expectations, these expressions lasted less than half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, suddenly the door of the room was ringing, because Brest arranged for a person to stare outside, if there was any movement, knock on the door. At this time, the door is ringing, and something must have happened. The people in the room were all excitedly sitting up from the bed or on the chair. They pulled out the pistol hanging from the waist and walked lightly to the door. Brest whispered, "Who is outside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people outside the door even hit the word "I" without another Broke, "My stuff was left in your room yesterday. Your friend said that he didn't see it, but I think he saw it. If you don't mind, let me go in and see, maybe it's inside."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?", Brest opened a small slit in the door, and through the slit he saw a man in his thirties, wondering why, in his nostrils Itching and itching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was watching the man, that person was watching him, after the two looked at each other for a while, the man suddenly said, "Maybe I lost it." The place is gone, sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he did not hesitate to turn and left, Brest stumbled, and soon reacted, can not let this People leave! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
