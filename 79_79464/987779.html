			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald, who hangs up the phone, sits on his chair and licks his hair. The pain from the scalp can’t cover his inner helplessness. There is anger that cannot be suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seilem puts forward two conditions, as long as he can do both of these conditions, everything will return to calm, and some will even stand up to take part Responsibility. But these two conditions made him unacceptable, and even thought that he did not want to remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first request, he must personally call Mr. Doolin to admit that his own blind arrogance caused the turmoil in the society of the city of Riodis. And begged Mr. Doolin for forgiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second request, he must immediately submit his resignation letter to the state government, resign from his position as the mayor of Otis, and then publicly apologize to the public. Repent of what you have done, and then leave here forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he has done both, within one hour of his completion of these two requirements, all business operations in Otis will be replied, twenty 70,000 jobs will reappear, people will once again become settled, and the businessmen who invest here, the members of the Otis business group will continue to support the decree of the city hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if Donald declined such "goodwill", Selem did not say what to do, but Donald knew that they would definitely try to get rid of themselves. And even let myself be subject to some investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not afraid of investigation, he is afraid of being ousted, this is cruel to a politician than killing him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill him, he may still leave some political thoughts, political lines, continue to play his role in the political arena, constantly being mentioned by the latecomers or even affirmed His thoughts will continue until a major political system reform, and will gradually fade away. His body is dead, political life is still alive, and his family, his sons and future generations will benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are ousted, no matter what kind of work he has done, what kind of dedication, what kind of outstanding political thoughts and visions, all this Even if it is all right, it will be negated by people. Because he is a loser, a loser cannot have mature political thoughts. This is an iron law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He painfully picked up the phone and called the father who worked in the capital, and he had to ask his father for help. Although his father is only a very ordinary legal person who interprets the definition of justice, even a remarkable title is not available, but his special position is destined to make him incompetent, but also has considerable lethality. He is a double-edged sword that can hurt himself or hurt others. When you need to use him, people who might use him will not care if they can hurt themselves. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, in the core of the Imperial political arena, the complexity of politics is far more than other places. Here is the sharpest contradiction between the New Party and the Old Party. Somewhere, every day, every moment, some people are calculating other people. The only one who can stop here, even an insignificant official, has a very high political quality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From receiving a call from his son, Donald’s father was not surprised. He had already seen a lot of negative reports about the mayor of Otis in the Imperial Capital. It’s not too late for Donald to call him now. He only told Donald a word, no, it was a word, and immediately let Donald have a feeling of rebirth after the fire, as if all the fog in front of him was set aside, the sun came out, and a few dark clouds were about to disperse. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did he say? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one word for two syllables! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cape!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald’s father is mingling in the political vortex of the capital So he is more aware of the cruelty of politics. If his son is this piece of material, he will be able to know what he is talking about. If he can't guess what he wants to say, it means that Donald is not the one. He doesn't need to stand up again and follow the crowd. He can wait for the next generation to grow up and replace Donald to complete his dream in politics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald was very clever, and he immediately realized that Du Lin had a stun, and two of the seven photos were the murderer and Solo. Together with the photo, this is equivalent to dragging the Cape family down. His father’s meaning was very clear. With the opportunity of Du Lin’s time, he completely dragged Cape into the quagmire and then stood on the side of the Cape family without reservation. Let the Cape family and Doolin fight, no matter who wins or loses, he will not be the worst one to lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the opportunity to defeat Du Lin to get the real rule of the city of Otis, but also received the acceptance of the Cape family, this will be his strongest support in politics! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I will let them take out the photos of the Cape family.", Du Lin is sitting in the room and is talking to Kevin, Kevin II. The quarter will be transferred to the Imperial Department of Justice to serve as one of the most annoying prosecutors he once had, and the prosecutor’s promotion to the Minister of Justice is as difficult as the promotion of the City Court’s law to the Life Justice. But political things are hard to say. Sometimes you don't need to have many personal abilities. You only need people to nominate when you are in the new cabinet. An unknown person can become a minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin’s current mission is to exercise, strengthen his business skills, and woven his network of personal interests in the Ministry of Justice, and he will be nominated for the Ministry of Justice one day. At the time of the minister, at least it will not be a general of one person, and it will be able to call the entire Ministry of Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin is very passionate about politics now. He is talking to Du Lin this time to consider the seven photos Du Lin throws. Is it too sloppy? . These photos not only hit Donald, but also involved the Cape family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin continued: "The person responsible for the execution plan is said to have disappeared. I can treat him as dead, if the Cape family does not intervene. It is their luck, once they decide to intervene, they will find that this is not as simple as a quagmire. This is a swamp, a swamp that eats people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;More and more open information exchanges make public opinion and public opinion play a more important role in the political arena of the empire. If the Cape family intervene, then the first object they need to face is not Doolin, but those "Protection" Du Lin's paradox of fighting, there are many accusations of social celebrities fighting for ethnic independence, and surging public opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether they handed in or not paying, they are destined to assassinate Doolin’s case. They are the old aristocrats and the other side. Sending "new officials", together with power and interests as a condiment, will turn into a rich meal and become a matter of people and discussions for more than a whole year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as this testimony is established, even if there is not enough evidence, Magus, who is sharpening the knife on the side, will definitely raise the sharp knife. Cut on the body of the Cape family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of "old times" nobles actually assassinated officials of the new era for the sake of their interests? Who gave them the courage to trample on the laws of the empire, is it God? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of investigations will be carried out, Donald will not only benefit from this, but will therefore fall deeper and deeper, and finally it is absolutely impossible to die only Donald and the Cape family. These two, there will be more people being involved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot to say, the more you are, the more you will be able to start your own people. As a empire big aristocrat, Magus has a better understanding of the nobility than Du Lin, which is more clear than most people in the society. These only destroying the unconstructed parasites can only make the country weaker and weaker. Never expect this group of vampires to feed their blood back to the empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has arranged a lot of backhands to fight with these two forces. He is now an official without a burden, without the burden of the mayor, he It is invincible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Doolin’s explanation, some of Kevin’s unreasonable things suddenly became clear, and he played with the law as a good hand, but on politics. Not well understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, since you said that you arranged it, I wouldn’t have to worry about it. Let’s talk, is there anything fun in the West? I heard that The woman in the west is very hot and open, is it true?" After the three sentences, Kevin relapsed and talked about the enjoyment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin replied with a smile: "If you don't mind the women who are all covered in dusty soil and can use their fingers to get rid of mud, explore the origin of life." I think it might be more suitable for you to live here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds very interesting, I also heard that you will ride on horseback while riding a horse Is it true to use body fluids? It’s really a thrilling horse. When I hand over the work here, I will go to your side for a few days. You have to arrange this for me...”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hanging up the phone, Du Lin is also a bit troublesome. On the horseback, while the horse is galloping, while the spirit and the meat are highly coincident, the sublimation of the soul is also a feature of this side? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After ten days of dissemination and precipitation, Du Lin’s notoriety was finally thoroughly spread in the western world. The strange thing is that the local government did not come to him. The trouble is like having never heard of Du Lin’s character. This strange phenomenon made Du Lin feel that it might be a doorman or someone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just at such a special node, Garfield came to the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the largest steel supplier to Ilyan himself, and later followed the pace of Doolin, also known as the largest steel supplier in Otis, plus his own shot The next piece of land can now be said to be a small number of people on the empire tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of liquidity alone, there are nearly 20 million deposits in the bank, and with the real estate industry, his wealth has expanded to six or seven million! If you try harder, you may be able to build a small consortium with his own core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Garfield came to the west was that I heard that Du Lin took an iron mine in the first time after the development of the west. His business will always leave. Not to open these iron ore, plus Doolin pulled him, he is also a person who knows how to be grateful - especially after Lu was found suicide during the prison, and after Juan jumped off the building, he knows what it is called. thanksgiving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not looking for a few chances to repay Du Lin, he may not be able to sleep well at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you took an iron ore and thought that my good days are finally coming. You don't need to find someone to get the ore through the relationship. "You helped me, Du Lin!", Garfield's appearance is very grateful, as if he was not coming to repay, but to thank Du Lin for providing him with quality ore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his performance, Du Lin was also well aware that he took Garfield around the mine area. "The iron ore iron here." The content is 53%, dry-base sample, and the amount of mining is average. If you want to give this to me, it seems that I have to take a few more iron mines!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garfield was very concerned about the quality of Du Lin’s iron mine, and he also made a few reports. Although it is said that he has repaid Du Lin's help to him in the past two years, this kind of reciprocation should not be based on his own complete loss. Such retribution will only make the two people's sentiments quickly collapse. A reasonable deal and a partial profit are the real rewards, at least Garfield thinks so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The content is good, I can provide the price of eight dollars per ton of raw ore, unlimited sales can be!", for this, Garfield is definitely half expert. According to the data provided by Doolin, it takes about five tons to six tons of ore to produce one ton of base steel. Now that the empire has caused steel prices to rise due to infrastructure construction, the rise of raw materials has followed. The price of a piece of steel is between 80 and 120. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
