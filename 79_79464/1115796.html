			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was urged twice in Doolin and told him that because he hesitated during the time he lost a lot of money, Merlin smiled and said a Number - two million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two million is not a small amount, even if people’s income has increased a lot now, two million is also an astronomical number, which may require a middle-class family After maintaining the necessary expenses, it took more than a hundred years to make so much money. To say a lot, for those entrepreneurs, this may be a year's profit, of course, the western mine owners expressed disdain for this, and they have so much money for half a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not immediately agree, he waved at Di Nisha in the distance, and the little girl ran over. Since they became homeowners, the Hill’s power to kill and kill is in the hands of their sisters, and there is a feeling of exuberance. Although I felt that Doolin had a little too much practice, after mastering the family power, Dinisha gradually began to adapt to become ruthless in some respects. After all, the ass decides the head, when she needs to be responsible for every member of the family, when she needs to face the family glory for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of personal gains and losses, what is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally understands why every family always needs some people to sacrifice for the family, not the family gave up them, they gave up the family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boss!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Merlin wants to acquire a machinery factory to do agricultural machinery, this time You are here to help him build the company.” Du Lin arranged for it. Although Dinisha has been working in the bank, it is because of this job that she has a certain relationship with all walks of life. Understanding. Merlin didn't do business, and rushing to open a company is not necessarily... No, it will definitely face a lot of trouble. He didn't have time to help Merlin solve these troubles every day. It was better to hand it to Dinesha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the best way is to let Merlin wrestle, go crawling and mature, become a qualified businessman - this is ordinary Human approach. With Du Lin's current power and wealth, I don't care about this issue. The mature team will solve all the troubles for Merlin. Even if he fails, it is not a problem. The problem of having money is never a problem. Du Lin’s current financial resources are fully supportive. Mei Lin made mistakes while doing it. He couldn’t make a comeback. Anyway, he has money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these brothers and sisters, Du Lin can help them where they are, and give them as much help as possible. But help is definitely not forever, nor is it all-round. After all, they are brothers and sisters. He is not their father. He can't manage them forever. Being able to do well, then it is best, not doing well. Perhaps being a wealthy idler is also a good choice. Of course, Du Lin hopes that they can develop independently. This seems very contradictory, but there is no way to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are glorified by him, and they may be bleak because of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Du Lin told him that he would transfer the money to his bank account later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending Dinisha, Du Lin’s quiet Mimi’s admonished Merlin’s words. Since he has decided to get married, don’t make too ugly things. otherwise, Mr. Ke Sima will come to beat him. Mr. Kesma has complained to him about the fact that Merlin should have been married the last time, and he is very dissatisfied with Mr. Kemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending Merlin again, Blair finally got the chance, the two walked into a small room behind the church, the priest got two hundred from Doolin After the money's donation, he left very satisfied. He also said that he would tell the lost lamb to the Lord's gratitude to God, and he would not come in at least an hour. This is a very interesting priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sat in the chair, and Brenen spoke up on some more intimate topics. "Do you know, Harry is finished."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin suddenly stunned, he really didn't know about it, he couldn't help but wonder, "What happened to him? Some time ago I heard that he still has a chance, now How could it be finished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellen smiled and gave Du Lin a cigarette. He also ordered one. "The cabinet decided to lift Harry. At the current position, at the committee meeting, the chairman was very annoyed at Harry’s acceptance of bribes and duty crimes. He believed that he had discredited the positive image of the new party and decided to give him certain punishment. He was downgraded and did not give a new move. "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the current empire is concerned, Magus is the first person in the empire, the Prime Minister of the Cabinet, who holds the fate of the entire country, then ranks The second is the chairman of the New Party Committee, and the third is the party whip of Bowworth. Now that Magnus did not make a statement, the Chairman of the New Party Committee and Bowworth agreed to the handling of Harry. In fact, it has already explained the attitude of Magus through silence. He also agreed to do so. Otherwise, he will definitely hug the current situation for Harry, but he did not do so, apparently intends to give up Harry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry’s affairs are indeed quite big. As a bystander, Doolin completely forgot that this was actually a good show for his director. He is now an audience when no one knows. At the same time he was expelled from public office, he was also dismissed as a member of the New Party because of Bowos’ strong request. Magus didn't talk at that time. Is there some dirty dark curtains that Dolin is too lazy to guess, obviously there is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry is now abandoned and he is the same as the original, to say that Magus did not play any role, killing Doolin would not believe. If this is not the case, this is the opinion of Magus. It is just a change of one person to perform and extend deeper. On the surface, the discord between Magus and Bowworth is also an illusion? If Magus is really as good as this old man, he will inevitably die and ensure that his position in the new party will not be shaken, but he does not do that, which is worth remembering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of problems within the New Party. Doolin has not been involved for a long time. He can also feel that there are certain problems from top to bottom. Harry is abandoned. Absolutely It is not a case, nor an isolated incident. There must be a deeper reason behind this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin picked up his eyebrows and didn’t talk. Braun smiled and didn’t care. He continued, “I have a less mature idea. The next general election will be...18 months. Do you think I can compete for the position of the governor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Du Lin did not leave Lerrenken had never considered this issue, because Doolin was Harry's shackles and was also a shack of Magus, no matter how they chose, he could not choose his head. But now that Du Lin has left, Harry is finished, and the new mayor of Otis is fascinating, so far there is nothing to achieve. On the contrary, he was able to turn the tide when Nano Lindes began to decline, directly changing the urban economic structure, giving the city a new light, and ignoring personal ability in the state, he is definitely among the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone can support him, it may not be possible to take the position of the governor. Once he can win the position of the governor, it means that he really entered the center of the political arena. The seats in the new party will also be moved to the table, and will not sit against the wall every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole family is starting to think about whether this is possible or not. In the dark, a campaign team has been hired to start the campaign strategy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s look was awkward. He always thought that there would be another two years to change the general election. But today, Blaine’s words awakened him, leaving only 18 months to leave the next general election. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly time became tight, as if someone had pinched his egg and gave him a slight tingling swelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recovered and pouted for a moment and said, "This is perfectly fine. There is no conflict with my interests, but I There is an idea..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two talked in the church for a long time, after the wedding ended, the people were all gone, and at the end of the afternoon, two talents from the church Come out. They went back to the city center to eat something, and then Du Lin returned to Otis. In the process of discussing with Bren, he already felt that his previous plan was successful, at least it was right to pull the Hill sisters into his own circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can clearly feel that Blair’s attitude towards himself has changed. It is a sense of identity, an attitude of reciprocity. In the past, this was impossible. Even when Blair followed the development of Otis in the back of his ass and learned how to build a city in the form of students, Du Lin could feel that he was very modest. But I still look down on myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this feeling is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A conversation with Blair reminded him of the urgency before Ernst, and Du Lin realized that he had not reversed it in some respects, or after all It is the first time in life, and many things have not been experienced. Fortunately, this conversation with Braun made him understand the urgency of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the room, Doolin made a call to Kevin. When the sound of the cymbal sounded, Du Lin directly interrupted his nonsense. "Do you have a reliable campaign team that you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political campaign is actually a commercial act, simply to spend money to buy a sense of identity From politicians, ask workers to eat chickens, and spend money to ask some children to go. Only adults can go to adult nights. In fact, this can be seen as a kind of trading behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary transactions, and post transactions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
