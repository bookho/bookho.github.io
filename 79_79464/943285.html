			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The third question, or ask this reporter friend..." Du Lin extended three fingers. "When is the anonymous letter, when did you accept it?" Where is the letter now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs to figure out that the sudden appearance of these reporters is that Felicia used his own means, or there are others It is important to deal with him. If it is made by Felica, then he will give the other party a huge surprise, which has already touched on the extent of threatening his life. He can't be light and nothing happens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the truth of the attack on Nano Lindes is fully exposed, first people will question whether he is eligible to become a mayor, even though this is true Lin is not very important. However, once he lost the protective clothing of the mayor, in order to calm the incited public opinion and the public opinion behind it, the empire must give an account to the citizens of the entire empire. Coupled with his "minority" and other personal labels, it is highly probable that the Supreme Court of the Empire will send him to the gallows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter is not useful even if Maggs is in the early stage, the role of public opinion is playing a more and more important role in this new era. He has no other way to go except to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Princess Ferrari, who led to this is very likely to happen, must bear the corresponding responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to kill me, then don't blame me for killing you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunt has calmed down, he recalled, "Four days ago... No, it should be five days ago, when I packed my mailbox four days ago. Found. The letter is in my bag..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer made Du Lin not much easier, just to prove that this matter has nothing to do with Fei Lijia, He looked at Kina, and Kina took the backpack that Hunter carried with him. From the inside, I pulled out a letter that had been taken apart. Du Lin glanced at it and began to read it carefully. This letter is handwritten. This is very good. The person who might have handwritten the letter did not realize that the letter might fall into his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The font is very beautiful, and it can be seen that the person who wrote the letter has enough accumulation and the status may not be ordinary. Because most ordinary people, including some wealthy capitalists, will not practice how to write beautiful words. Ordinary people do not need to do this, they may not need to write a pleasing font for a lifetime, those rich capitalists have a secretary to do the work, the secretary can write the word is neat, it is not written The necessity of a fancy font. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, fancy fonts, although the person who wrote the letter has already constrained his habit of writing, but there are some clues from the beginning and end of some letters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He broke the letter into his pocket and opened the notebook of Hunter. There were some unimportant records in front, but when he was in the second half of the book, he saw what Henter wrote today. There is a lot of content about the Nano Lindes attack, including the official hidden silver chips, including Todd's death, and some people's speculation at the time. What made Du Lin feel the most ridiculous was the behavior of the hymn family who assassinated him. He was actually assigned to Todd... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea is very interesting, he handed the notebook to the Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunter’s bag also has a wallet with some business cards and his own business cards, as well as banknotes of about tens of dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunting was not calm when Du Lin took out his wallet, but he said nothing, no sound. When Du Lin read it with his business card, he was a little panicked, not only his identity in the newspaper, but also his identity in the family industry - a special contributor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect Mr. Hunter's relationship network to be so vast, here are... three companies hired you as a special writer, can tell me about you and them. "Do you have a relationship?" Du Lin played with two business cards and put the wallet back in Hunter's bag, but he left a business card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunt’s lips moved, he wanted to make up a lie to deceive Doolin, but soon he realized that any lie had been exposed. . And his relationship with these three companies can only be understood with a single phone call, and there is absolutely no need to hide. He told Du Lin honestly that the presidents of the three companies were his fathers. He used the identity of the three special writers and the rich and rich, and mixed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin put the bag on one side of the grass and then looked at another guy, "Mr. Hunt has already answered my question and I Very satisfied, then the next question is between us.", he smiled, went to the side and found a firewood pier to sit down, today he did not sit down all night, sleep and sleep half Screaming, I was a little tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember that the Ministry of Defence had agents who asked you to manage your mouth. Is that true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The guy nodded quickly, he was too scared, and Todd Doolin dared to kill. He was not famous for even those whose names were not qualified. There is no problem at all. "Yes, some agents told We don't want to disclose these things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So why do you want to say it?", Du Lin glanced at Hunter. "Is it because of money?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy nodded silently. He was moved by 100,000 pieces. It will be a brand new life, and he will say goodbye to his past. But what he didn't think was that the money didn't come, and Du Lin's people found the door, which made him even more afraid of Du Lin's power, it was terrible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"100,000..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sighed. "Do you have to tell these things to other people? Or do you know who revealed the news like you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head quickly. "No, I only told Mr. Hunter alone. As for others, I am not sure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a picture of his legs and stood up. "Very good, gentlemen, our quiz game went very smoothly, and the two candid performances made me very moved."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can we go now? I want to go home, my daughter may not have dinner at night." The office staff of the Nano Lindes City Hall looked at the surprise Lin, "I swear I won't say anything to anyone anymore!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunt also looked forward to watching Du Lin, but Du Lin A look of surprise, "When am I? Have you said that you want to let go? Have you said that?", looked at the Buddha, and Buddha shook his head, so he spread his hands in the eyes of two quickly desperate eyes. "The question and answer game just Let you avoid being beaten and tortured. You are all going to hurt me in this way. Do you think that I will not do anything like that, let you leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his head slightly, "Everyone has to pay for his actions, this will be the eternal truth!", he said, licking the shoulders of the Buddha, walking toward the warehouse Go, "Go, go back to sleep, there are still many things to do tomorrow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two watched Du Lin really leave, and immediately struggled, Hunter shouted loudly, he told the people around who are approaching, what is his identity, how rich he is, what kind of reward he would give if he left him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have forgotten that these people are only the executors at the bottom, and the ambassador has left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crying soon came to an end, and the reddish straw would have made the animals in the ranch feel happy because they not only added salt, but also Added a lot of nutritious things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, when Fei Lijia appeared in the lobby on the first floor, Du Lin greeted him, and Fei Lijia stopped. Standing in the field smiling and facing the appearance of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very sorry to bother you, can you help me see what special places are there in these writings?" Du Lin handed a piece of paper over. There are some separate words in the middle of the paper, which are not coherent and do not involve any substantive content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feilijia took the paper and gave it to Du Lin. "This should be written by a gentleman. He has a distinguished status and status. Other than that, I can't see other content."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thanked him after leaving with Fei Lijia, now he has locked in wanting to The person behind the knife - the Solo or Cape family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a feeling when he saw this letter last night, except that the nobility would circle at the beginning of the letter or at the end of the street, I am afraid there are no other people. I will write things in this troublesome way of writing. Among the people he offended or offended, except the Cape family, there was only the Miss Fatima family in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunt told him that the letter came from six days ago, maybe six days ago, Felicia was still in the north, not even his face, two There is no interest in the relationship between them, so it certainly won't be written by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin suddenly felt a little funny. Originally, Magus did not agree to establish a second and more SAR because he could not be sure of the cities of these SARs. Chang can stand as strict as Doolin and resist the erosion of capital power in the same position as Magus. But he suddenly agreed, in addition to his own ideas, there is also a purpose to lay down the contradiction between him and the Cape family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
