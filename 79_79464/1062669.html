			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Phyllis...", the local branch president is very embarrassed. It takes a lot of formalities to freeze the real-name account, not to freeze it. . First, you need a reason that is reasonable and legitimate. For example, this account involves the black money of a gang transaction, or a reason related to fraud, and then it needs to be from the local police station to the state investigation bureau level from low to high according to the content of the reason. The administrative order will then need to be reported to the head office, and finally the head office will be able to freeze an account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis has no reason to be reasonable and legitimate, and there is no official order from the official department. As for the head office he said, the approval will soon be approved. Without a shadow, how can a branch president really listen to his words and freeze Du Lin’s account? As the president of the branch in the western region, he has a deeper understanding of Du Lin, who has been red in the west for more than half a year. This is a "social model" for stepping horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only saved countless slave miners from the hands of the mine owners, but also gave them freedom and gave them the opportunity to realize their dreams in the empire. In the west, a large number of farms and pastures were opened, and millions of people have stable job opportunities. People in the whole west are saying that Du Lin is good. Few people say that Du Lin is not good. Even the church's stubborn stubbornness can't wait to give Du Lin a medal to recognize his good deeds for society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the most important thing is that Doolin has a lot of investment in the West. Once he freezes his account, it will inevitably cause huge losses to his business. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If freezing the Doolin account is necessary and reasonable, he may not be affected too much. But once Doolin’s own affairs couldn’t freeze the account itself, but he did, his future would be over, and the Western Central Bank would have to pay for his actions and compensate Dulin for all the economic losses he suffered during the freeze on the account. In the size of Du Lin’s net worth and business, it’s sure to say that the loss of millions is not enough. Maybe he can pull out tens of millions. He has to bear responsibility. Even if the central bank pays compensation, he will end up. I am afraid it will be very miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the director of a head office to rush to freeze Du Lin’s account, I’m afraid that my head will not be kicked when I go out in the morning? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in order to be as acquitted as possible, Mr. Phyllis, who has a bit of a problem, the branch president’s statement is relatively euphemistic, “according to the regulations promulgated by the head office System, freezing an account requires a lot of formalities, I can understand your urgent mood at this time, I have a proposal...", Phyllis nodded and let him say it, the branch president said slightly lower, "Because you said that the head office will approve it soon, I don't know the specific inside story, so I need you to sign a director's power to exercise the confirmation letter, confirm that the freezing of the account is done by you personally. What do you think? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phyllis frowned slowly, and the power of the director’s power was proved to ensure that the head office could not be notified when certain unexpected events broke out, or that it must be made when the situation was very complicated and there was no effective conclusion. At the time of the decision, the central bank's directors directly made a supporting document needed for the final decision in the way that is most in line with the interests of the central bank. Prove that all decisions are the opinions of one director and exclude other people's opinions downwards, with their own decisions as the final written document. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this document, the president of the Western branch does not have to bear any responsibility. After the document is signed, he is equal to the change from the president. Become an ordinary employee, and Felice became the branch president with the right to decide. If you have to take responsibility in the future, it can only be borne by Phillips alone. It will not be implicated in other people. Of course, if the decision of Phyllis brings great benefits, all the fruits of victory are only Philip. Can be enjoyed by one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president of the branch is undoubtedly shirking responsibility. Without this written document, he will be jointly and severally liable, even under the operation of some people. Responsible party. But with this written document, even if Felice blows up the west, he has no relationship with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk is definitely smaller and the better, the more people bear the better, the first reaction of Phyllis is to refuse, he does not want to sign this document, He does not want to gamble his future on this action. However, there is no better way to curb Doolin’s actions at this time. If you call to report the problem to the head office, he will be criticized first because he has not handled the matter first and has not been wary of competitors. The vigilance of such dirty means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the head office must definitely open a board to discuss the final decision, because Du Lin is not a person who is not a name, he is a celebrity, in society It has a high reputation. Any flaw in a targeted behavior will have a huge negative effect on the imperial central bank. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This society is very complicated, and one has a set of rings. People only see that the imposing central bank, a huge economy, is rampant in the financial markets of the emperor and abroad, but they don’t know. They also need to face many troubles and problems. Outside the empire, the influence of the international consortium and the influence of the indigenous forces will not be said. In the empire, there will be competition from the southern commercial banks and the step by step of the cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the largest economies in the empire, it is always a major matter not to be in the hands of the authorities, or to be in the hands of the cabinet. Disadvantages. Since the new party took office, it has always wanted to integrate the imperial central bank into the government system, and even set a new "banking department" to lead the bank's securities and finance industry. The ministers and the top leaders of all departments are from the empire. Selected by the central bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, as long as the board of directors voted, the board will become the Imperial Bank of China, a minister of the silver certificate department, other directors will become the highest rankings of various departments, and even directly interfere with the management of securities and other financial business! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central bank’s board of directors has opened 14 councils in succession, and ultimately failed to make the cabinet successful. These bankers still maintain their independent positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejecting the cabinet’s request is a very difficult matter, so the central bank should avoid any mistakes in major decisions as much as possible and prevent the cabinet from finding a chance. Intervene in the management of the central bank. If there is no sign to freeze Doolin's account without any reason, Du Lin will most likely turn a staff's "wrong" into a political storm, and let the cabinet find the rationale for intervening in the management of the central bank. By that time, the central bank will lose a lot of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and autonomy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Phillips was also hesitant. He hesitated and picked up the receiver after a while. This matter is not too big to say, but Still need someone to support him later. "Lord of the President, this is the case..." The structure of the Council of the Imperial Bank is very simple and is divided into three levels. As the first class, the rotating director fully presides over the daily work of the imperial central bank. The chairman is the second class and is responsible for implementing important plans and voting. The third level is the board of directors. Most of the directors are bankers or investors who have certain shares. They play the role of linking up and down, conveying the orders of the head office to the localities and working with the localities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chairman of the company that Felice contacted will become the chairman of the rotation after three years. Now the market has risen, and many people are jealous of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it after listening to everything that Phyllis told, and said on the phone, "I agree with your plan, I will help you on the board." Say, even if something really happened, I will try to help you. But Mr. Phyllis, I have taken such a big risk for you, but if you can’t do enough work in the West to help us Realizing our plan, even if I don't forgive you, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis nodded and finally cautiously hung up the phone, he With a sigh of relief, he glanced at the branch president standing on the side and handed his name on the document he had prepared. When the last stroke was finished, he said that the pen was thrown on the table, and he smiled and said, "You heard it and saw it. Hold the document and freeze the account of Doolin." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
