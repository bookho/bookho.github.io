			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You won...", Barr repeatedly looked at the board and smiled and shook his head. "Can you tell me why I lose every time?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus said while playing with the pieces on the board, "because you always want more, ignore every little loss." In the end, these losses will accumulate together and you will find that you are no longer possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggs and Barr are good friends for decades Good friends can still be good to meet and chat often is not an easy task. Even if it is a loved one, it is difficult to maintain such a relationship, showing how strong the friendship between the two is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have said this for decades, haven’t I changed at all?" Barr gathered the pieces and considered it for a while. I shook my head. "I will still lose anyway. I will stop here today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t care about Barr’s abandonment of Magus, as Barr said. In this way, such things have been happening for decades, and he will never change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in Magus, Bar is a very remarkable person, he has a longer-term look than himself, but he did it on the details. Not good enough, probably because of the identity of the Balkan nobility, let him subconsciously ignore many subtle details. These details alone will not be a problem, but when all the details are put together, you can foresee a straight line that deviates from the slightest angle for some reason, and then goes further and further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that Du Lin wants..." When the two men talked about Doolin’s question, Margot’s wife came in with a small snack, Bardox After picking up a piece into his mouth, his face showed a happy smile, and he could not help but praise, "Veneca, the snacks you made are as boring as before, and you feel happy."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman showed a little smile, and then looked at Magus silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus has a headache and picks up a piece. It takes a sip, and the taste of the tired person is exactly like that of Barr, and there is no previous The change, he also praised a few words on the scalp, "very delicious!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are lying, Magus, the vain tone and the false expression on your face tell me that you are lying!" Barr immediately began to dismantle the stage, and then sighed. "Why didn't you marry me at the beginning?" He looked at Seneca and asked a question that had been asked for decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three people were very good friends decades ago, Bar and Magus are pursuing Winika, and finally Winica married Magus, which made Barr very disgusted for a while and even hated Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the ruthless ripening agents of the years, everyone has become more mature, and Bar has gradually relieved the resentment in the heart, and everyone often gets together. There is always a knot in his heart. Why was it that at that time, he was better than Magus, but Veneca had to marry Magus, who was not as good as himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenica has never given the answer to Barr, which also made Bart entangled for a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe because you are stupid!", Magus also did not give Barr a face, their relationship has been beyond the ordinary friend relationship, and a little bit Contradictory places, in short, very special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venica did not give Barr any answer, smiled and left, she was in a good mood. There are only two people who can make her happy at this age. One is Du Lin's cute young man. He appreciates his cooking skills very much. He will take away many when he walks. This is the biggest compliment to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other one is to see the mutual destruction between Bar and Magus, which can also make her very happy, and the time between them seems to be back to dozens Years ago, under an apple tree, the two boys smothered each other in order to compete for her favor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I think of the two most noble people in the empire, I have done such stupid things, especially for making such stupid things for myself, and Seneca is very happy. Even the mindset has become much younger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the two most noble men of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar is just a nickname for Maggs, his name is Kubar, the current leader of the party... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be very unbelievable. The New and Old parties are about to fight for the votes of voters in various places, but the leader of the old party often runs to the New Party. The leader’s family came to eat and drink, but also thought about smashing the corner. The world is so magical, especially in places that people can’t see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the old woman left, Barr picked up a piece of pizza and stuffed it into his mouth. He chewed it very elegantly, and couldn't even see the broken pieces falling on the clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Back to our previous topic, I heard that Du Lin is coming back, is the engagement ceremony fast?" Look at the clothes on your chest, take a cup and take a sip to wash away the food residue that may remain in the mouth. "He is very beautiful in the west, are you teaching him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I?", Magus snorted. "What can I teach him? I didn't think he did it so well. It just proves that we need to assimilate him as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Magus was a little worried. He sighed and fiddled with the pancakes in the two dishes. "We will eventually go old, die, you may It has also been found that few of the imperial aristocrats of the empire have seen excellent young people, only a few of them are there, and there are several beside the sacred lord. We are almost dying here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The children are all on the front line On the surface, they only think about more benefits, but forget that the empire and power are their decent fundamentals. Now the international situation is changing too fast, and there are many internal contradictions. If the situation is still not clear, the current The system will become a heavy coffin board, and finally they will be buried!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We need an excellent leader who can suppress others for the future I am responsible for 50 to 100 years. If I can choose, I would rather not choose Doolin, but I can't see many excellent characters except him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to choosing him, there is no second choice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar also sighed, since the New Party overthrew the feudal rule, The peaceful development of more than ten years and more than 30 years has made many young aristocrats become mediocre, and this is what they are most afraid of when they are older. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace can kill too many families to forge ahead, but this is also the choice of the times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, the aristocrats have been constantly fighting each other, it is precisely this seemingly chaotic mutual attack, so that every family and every generation A good enough successor can appear. Because they must be excellent, once they have a mediocre successor, other nobles will have a glimpse of their territory, glimpse their wealth, and even want to take away their title and power. Under such huge internal and external pressures, everyone is crazy and makes themselves as good as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But look at the present, the younger generation of people and enjoyment, an old dog family of hundreds of children in the talented two or three, the other are proficient in eating, drinking and playing. Peace has made them lose their fighting spirit, making them mediocre, and mediocre to some people are almost unable to support the "noble" sign! On the contrary, the power of the civilian class has gradually emerged. There are a large number of members from the civilian class in the New Party and the Old Party, such as the current empire. The New Party’s party whip, Bowworth, is a very typical representative of civilians who are in high positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Magus and Kubar are able to suppress these powerful, courageous, and daring civilian members, but when their offspring, now When the new generation grows up and they lack the necessary means, they are very likely to be overwhelmed by these forces from the civilian class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last thing that Maggs and Kubar and even the current aristocrats want to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s unreasonable that after a few hundred years of struggle, the power of the country was handed over to civilians, and then they were taken aside, so that they might even Perform liquidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles lost their motivation, but the civilians did not. The new era gave the civilians more upward momentum, because this is a miracle era, as long as you dare to fight Dare to fight, may not have the opportunity to climb to the spire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar packed up a bit of frustration and asked a question, "Are you sure you can completely assimilate Doolin on our side? Know him It is also from the civilian class, perhaps he has a deeper recognition of the civilian class!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this question, Magus did not hide this time, but rather Fang said his point of view. "He has a lot of ambitions. As long as he has ambitions, he will be much better. I have already had enough of those young people who are waiting for the status quo to inherit the family business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin’s ambition will make him and the interest groups around him a new 'class', they are like the first generation of nobles, for The desire for power will alert them to all possible subversives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The times are always moving forward, since we can’t stop the future megatrends, Then we join them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
