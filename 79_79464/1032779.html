			<div id="content">At the same time, the eyes of both domestic and foreign media have focused on the west. A mine owner named Federer took the lead and decided to go to the whole society. A series of issues in the western part of the empire were announced, which made the West Mine very passive. Before that, they had been subjected to a series of attacks, plus the accusations that did not exist at all. The remaining four executives had already been devastated. Now Federer’s betrayal has made their situation even more dangerous. The phenomenon of slavery in the west came to the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence and inaction of the cabinet seem to be more certain. Perhaps the cabinet hopes that through such a press conference, the moral burden will be given to the West Mine, no Better than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how to end the game, this is definitely not something that makes people happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was full of smoke, four people who looked extraordinary, sitting or standing, with cigarettes in their hands, and the ashtrays around them were stuffed It has been six hours since the cigarette butts, and they still have not figured out how to make them safe through this crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two of their biggest crises. The first one is the unspoken rules of Western mining that Federer will open tomorrow. The most terrible thing about this is the use of slaves. The use of cheap slaves to excavate mines in the West is well known, and the extremely low prices of slaves can minimize the cost of mining, a high-risk industry. No one cares if the environment in the mine will cause some people to explode and die, and they don’t have to pay their high salaries. They just need to fill their stomachs and they can keep the ore from the mine. Send it out of the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All miners are using slaves, which has almost become the standard for mining. No one ever questioned the use of slaves, including the existence of slavery. Meet ethical requirements and meet legal requirements. From top to bottom, from the mine owner to the state government, everyone agrees with this system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not only a low cost, but also no major accidents, this is the perfect choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is the perfect choice. Now the West Mine will be promoted into the abyss. Those have nothing to do with the West, and have no relationship with mining. The guys who stand at the moral high ground will tear them all. Just as they heard that some orphanage managers let children do some technical work, their indignation, curse and condemnation of those scums do not have to bear extra costs and show their social responsibility side. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the scums are dead, some are in jail, and the situation is now reversed. This may be one of the end of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public opinion will form a huge storm, tearing them all into pieces. In order to calm the anger from inside and outside the empire, the cabinet will certainly deal with some people severely. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no deterrent effect on those mine owners, and it does not reflect the importance that the empire attaches to these issues. The main personnel of the organization with great influence can let everyone's moral climax that is about to spurt out from the nostrils gradually subside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second crisis comes from the inside of the Western Mining Association. If there is only slavery in the west, their end will definitely not look good, but it is absolutely Can't be said to be miserable. It is not that they have formulated such rules. They have not maintained such rules. They are only representatives of an industry, and the punishment that is strict enough but does not involve life safety is enough to demonstrate the determination of the imperial legal system. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But once the problem arises, some people inside the West Mine will be shaken to extend more scandals, and they may actually have their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like Federer’s damn guy, he’s the first one, and it’s not the last one. There’s always someone thinking when this big ship is going to be silent. To save yourself. It may not be clear what the West Mine will do outside the West in these years, but the members of the West Mine are very clear. They manipulated the price of western ore through various means, and opened up a bright road for the admission of big capitalists through joint efforts with some illegal armed forces. In addition, they are suspected of infiltrating government officials, falsifying documents and concealing operating income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These illegal things are not pulled out by any one of them, but they are all put together in the sun to accept the judgment of the society. They live less than the end of this year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a way to contact Federer?", a 60-year-old silver-gray old man sucked a cigarette in his hand while spraying a smog Said: "It is best to talk privately with Federer and let him not expose more insider. This is a good thing for him. As long as he can agree, many people will still stand on our side. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another middle-aged man with flax-colored hair and a somewhat depressed face shook his head, and he grabbed a bottle of wine around him," Federer does not seem to be in the west now. He may have hid it in order to detonate the bomb. I really don't understand how good it is for him. We will be unlucky. All the organizations and individuals involved in mining will be unlucky, all mining. He will face a review. What is he doing for this?" He can't figure it out. This is something that everyone can't figure out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation has clearly moved in the direction of light. The thugs of the Free Front have been annihilated, and the mining trade in the west has begun to recover. The West, which has never had any attacks, has already had a stable and peaceful period. Why? At this time, Federer has to pick out the wind and rain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another light-haired guy frowned and asked, "Is it going to be related to the previous attack? Someone is targeting our West Mine, Federer may have been bought by them. If we fall, they will be able to control the west?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man with silver-gray hair nodded, "have this Possibly, in addition to the doormen, the enemies we face are the big capitalists, and the enemies are among them. But we are not sure who is the real hand, you think Jindis and Ou Will Leville be part of them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question left the other three in meditation, they opposed the big capitalists joining the West Mine and confronted The reason is that the strength of these big capitalists is too strong. If they are alone, the West Mine will not be afraid of them. However, if they are accepted into the Western Mining Association, these powerful capital forces will have a place where they can take advantage of them. They will soon replace the Executive Committee through a series of means to become the new manager of the West Mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the situation that executives are least willing to see, so they have taken the way of confrontation to keep these people in trouble, while maintaining a certain degree Cooperation, do not give them the opportunity to seize the West Mine will dominate. If these people are really united for some reason, it is very likely that this is what they did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think... will there be a copy of Doolin? The guy has had an irreconcilable conflict with us from the west, and I personally think The other assassinations of the Executive Committee have a lot to do with Du Lin. It may even be that Du Lin has instructed his men to do it. Is there any way to find a way to break the game from Doolin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room suddenly fell into silence. After this time, they found Du Lin is a very troublesome young man. He is like a hedgehog or wild ho, Full of thorns, whether it is a kind touch or a hostile collision, it will make you poke a hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence lasted for ten minutes, and the one who had never spoken finally spoke. "The current situation is very bad for us, and we don't have the ability to flip the current situation." Means, so I have a proposal...", he closed his mouth and looked at the other three people, only slightly suppressed some voices and said: "Before the situation has not completely deteriorated, transfer the property, transfer the family, if you can... Let's leave the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
