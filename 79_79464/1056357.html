			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duringlin and Mr. Jack said after a while, they quickly led the topic to the current situation in the west. Originally, this was not a strange topic, but when Mr. Jack called the phone by the king and the queen, and then said a lot of meaningless words, then when the topic was led to the situation in the west, even It’s a pig who knows what Mr. Jack is calling, and what he wants to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I read the newspaper. Recently, the work of the Western working class strike has been very troublesome. It has caused an impact on many industries in the west. Doolin is now in In the west, have you heard of the official plan to solve this trouble? There are many industries in the family there, and people are always worried." Mr. Jack said that there is nothing wrong with it. The poker organization is indeed in the west. There are a number of industries, in addition to mines, there are some light industrial type factories, and recently with Du Lin investing in two large ranch in the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poker organizations are the world’s largest underground money launderers, so they need a lot of money laundering channels to ensure that hundreds of millions of dollars or more of money can be washed smoothly every year. . Some small money-saving money-making industrial chains with regional restrictions are very small, and the means of money laundering are also very backward. Even if there is a big business, they can't eat. For example, Du Lin’s small boss who knew the money laundering during the period of Tener could wash a 200,000-dollar black money in a month, and he could not do anything more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to money laundering now tends to be more primitive, such as laundering through a laundry. Washing machine is actually a very early thing, but not every family can afford a washing machine, plus many people think that buying a washing machine is not worthwhile and many other reasons. Many communities have specialized laundry to provide convenience for residents. service. From the fifteenth to one cylinder with the most basic cleaning solution, to the twenty-five minute cylinder with various high-grade rinsing agents, many housewives are willing to use this cheap way to clean clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three or five days of washing, one month is just about a dollar, and it’s more cost-effective than buying a washing machine for dozens of dollars. Of course, more poor families still choose to wash their hands to save on living expenses, but the business of the laundry is always very hot - money laundering through this uncountable calculation has always been the usual means of gangs and small-scale money laundering. In addition, they laundered money through a “premium investment” approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, investing in a bakery, using the best building materials and decoration, others may need a thousand pieces to renovate a store, but they may have three or fifty thousand pieces of decoration. . After the renovation, put a label for sale for a few days, and then sell it to the other party at a price of 20,000 or 20,000 or 30,000. Although the investment failed, the loss was a lot, but how much money is there? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightly higher grade is to cooperate with some brokerage houses on Xie Lisi Street to launder money by auctioning antiques, buying and selling stocks, and falsifying books by false investment. These organizations are larger and have higher grades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most advanced is that organizations like poker have a very thick family, and the means of money laundering are varied, if not specifically focused on a certain point, and There is also a very tough backstage that is not afraid of conflicts, otherwise there is no way to take a poker. The mines in the west are almost all waste mines, but their monthly income is very good. A car waste ore is launched from the mine hole, and it is reported as a high-quality ore. It does not require any troublesome means, and it is washed out with a penny. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, their ranch, originally only a thousand cattle, but reported 10,000 cattle when reporting, "out of the air" every year This even the non-existent cow, after the tax is reported, will be thoroughly washed. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, recently, the money laundering houses of the emperor and abroad have been eyeing the casinos in Otis, and they often carry a lot of cash into the city of Otis by smuggling. The cash is handed over to the management of the casino, and then a handling fee, which is about 15% to 25 percent, can be returned home to collect the money. In this way, the casino will convert the deductible cash into a remittance slip into their designated bank account. In this way, they succeeded in making an empire dream in the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the customer’s identity is special and willing to pay the upper limit, the casino in Otis does not mind giving them an advertisement – ​​for example, a newspaper Waving a red-faced gambling stick to the front page to prove that he did win a lot of money through legal gambling, and by the way also made an advertisement for his casino. Mr. Jack is also laundering money through the casino, and Du Lin closed his eyes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, Mr. Jack has a very deep relationship with the imperial central bank, even the Ministry of Finance has a certain relationship with Mr. Jack, perhaps it seems to outsiders It is an incredible thing, but it is reality. Poker organizes such a large-scale money laundering dealer. In the eyes of high-level countries, they are laundering the crimes that are illegal and illegal. Their identity is not a money laundering bank, but an international currency smuggling channel. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any country will enter the country's large overseas funds to be vigilant, and even actively monitor the flow of this money. But if the money is indiscriminately flowing through the underground money house, the money will be secretly left and then secretly left, the regulatory authorities simply can't find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sometimes right and wrong are not so easy to distinguish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin retracted his thoughts and said, "There is no way for the authorities to resolve this storm. They are still making final efforts, but I am personal. I think it is meaningless to do so. It is futile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jack chuckled a few times. "I heard that the core issue of this strike is The three-guarantee policy cannot be maintained, is it?” Du Lin gave a definite answer. Mr. Jack’s words turned and asked: “If I say that there is a very powerful force to take the three-guarantee policy from the government. In the past, the government came out as a third-party regulator, and the beneficiary and the new contractor talked about the next three insurance business. What do you think, the strike will not continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Mr. Jack’s words, Du Lin’s whole person was a little embarrassed. He understood Mr. Jack’s words and he planned to do so. The purpose of his founding company, the Empire, is to undertake more than four million insurance policies! In Du Lin’s point of view, this is definitely not a burden, but a solid foundation, because from the next month, the four-million-dollar policy will continue to pay, and it will have to make up for the west in April and May. Unspent money, this will be a sum of more than 20 million funds, and it is still a one-time cash! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the cabinet, including Magus, and the state government and the city hall are in conflict with the three-guarantee policy is that they have not responded, or Cognitive errors. The first thing they consider is that an insured person can only enjoy a one-time accident premium of up to 8,000 pieces, or a bursary of no less than 3,500 pieces, and possibly thousands of people, who only need to pay 30 yuan per year. Tens of thousands of medical insurance payments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Converting with a very ordinary ratio, as long as one insured has a problem and needs to pay the insurance premium, it means two or three hundred insured persons. The fees paid will be used on an insured person. If you enlarge this number a little, as long as 10,000 of the more than three million insured people need to use this insurance for various reasons, then there will be extremely serious losses! And there may be a lot of people who only pay for three or five months to swindle the insurance. The insurance money looks great, but it is actually dangerous. If you are not careful, it will trigger new turmoil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially Mr. Roel has a very bad head, he successfully defrauded more than two million from the doorkeeper, plus three guarantees Not a commercial contract but an official policy, so no one is optimistic about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
