			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Capital, St. Nunnington, the city has always been the capital of the Yaoxing Empire, the core of politics, and no nature is allowed here. Gangs - this is a bragging argument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, you can’t confuse the gangs of the emperor with the gangs in other places. There are all kinds of gangs of all sizes, like the gangs. All the big gangs are all white gloves of some big men. They are responsible for doing dirty work for the big guys, collecting information, or doing something less legal. They never take the initiative to get involved in illegal troubles. They are more like a "office", the kind of thing that does everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The firm is also the name of the big gangs who live in the capital, they will not charge the fees, nor will they bully the market, they may do it in the eyes of the people. The terrible thing about the mouth is that when some rumors begin to spread, they rush into some people’s homes and tell them to manage their mouths. As for whether or not I have done other things, no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little gangs are not quite like gangs. Most of them are smugglers and pimps. They don’t have a strong sense of territory. They only care about whether they can They can make money, and they seem to be affected by the political atmosphere of the Imperial Capital, and they are very good at compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin’s wine entered the Imperial City and there was no fierce battle. The first time his man moved the gun and even shocked the other, then Negotiations were carried out under the arrangement of several celebrities and their respective business scopes were negotiated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the tabloid reporters living here will never feel the huge crisis hidden in the fog that is not seen in other places, so that they dare to Villa No. 1 on Empire Avenue was filmed. But this time, they will definitely encounter something different, and Du Lin will never be the one who follows the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good cars are always much better in data than ordinary cars, whether it is safety factor, decoration style, or its power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a black shadow rushing forward, and it took only seven or eight seconds to catch up with the reporter in more than two hundred meters. The car, the president’s nephew participated in the battles in other areas, and he knew exactly what he should do. When the head of the car he was driving reached half of the body of the reporter's vehicle, he slammed the direction and directly lost the reporter's car. He was slammed into the store at the intersection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a loud bang, people were shocked to see the tragic car accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president’s nephew’s head ran a lot of blood, and his head and the steering wheel were intimately contacted during the impact, and the rubber-covered steering wheel was given. He had a forehead and made him look very hurt. He rubbed his ribs in one hand, and some walked up to the front of the car, watching the unconscious journalist lying in the back seat, taking the camera off his neck and handing it over to the other two people who rushed over. Then he went to the phone booth next to him and called the police. "I think I had a traffic accident... Yes, someone was hurt, I don't know what to do... Yes... well, I will stay here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hangs up and walks out of the phone booth, returns to his car, his butt pressed against the twisted hood and ordered a cigarette. It's not like someone who really has a car accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two bodyguards sent the reporter’s camera to Du Lin’s face, and Du Lin took it in his hand, opened the box with the film, and put all the film Draw them out and then point them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victure stood on the side and watched the film finally turn into a liquid that was cooling, and the anger on his face subsided, he was even interested. "Would you be so barbaric when you were in the field?" He didn't know how to express what he wanted to say. "I mean, do you use force more frequently to deal with some problems? For example Gang wars and assassinations?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head and replied with certainty, “No, we never do anything illegal, If someone jumps out of the building, people should think about how cruel the society is pushing him to the road, not to know who helped him at the end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Voice stunned, then laughed. He looked at Du Lin's shoulder and looked very happy. "I like how you lie. This is my personal call. If you have time, we will get together. You will Like my party!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at one In the hands of business cards, business cards, very thick, surrounded by a circle pattern edging and silver hot in the middle of no Abramovich's name, phone number, only about a dozen or so twenty, God, horse riding private telephone. If you are in a hurry, it will take half an hour to play it once, but it has also been seen that Vicki is not a well-behaved person. He is a good friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put Vicki's business card into the business card holder and smiled and nodded. "Of course, I am looking forward to it." He said that he looked at another luxury car on the side of the road. "Do you need a ride?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your kindness, I will have a date, I will go by myself, then we...", Vicki refused Doolin’s kindness. The main reason is that his appointments are more private. For most people, things of a private nature do not want others to intervene. This is not an impolite rejection, but a very common thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin reached out and shook hands with Viktor and said goodbye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the sirens from the corner made the people in the car accidents slightly open. The doctors and the police appeared almost at the same time. Du Lin glanced at the handcuffs. The president of the scorpion, recovered his eyes and entered the luxury car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be people to deal with this matter, even if the reporter and his driver are killed in this car accident, the lawyers can ensure maximum The legal rights of the president’s nephew and the fact that another car has been maliciously changed has caused the traffic accident. The testimony of a small number of hitters cannot change the jury's resolution, because the factors that determine the outcome are always outside the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, there was nothing in the newspaper about Dolin and Vecchi privately. The reporters focused on Doolin and the Imperial Bank. On the lawsuit that continued to slap, two newspapers issued only locally reported the accident that happened last night, and in the newspapers it was considered a murder and a purposeful car accident. Although they did not name Du Lin’s name in the newspaper, they have been guiding the reader’s ideas in this regard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument is very marketable, and all conspiracy theories involving the characters are always market-oriented. "I know a secret" is always the bottom of society. Only in this way, they will not feel that they have been abandoned by the mainstream of society and become the cornerstone of this society - sometimes we will use stepping stones instead of the word, they are sometimes The meaning expressed is consistent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a fire in the two newspapers that night, there were no casualties, because the fire broke out in the middle of the night, but the offices of the two newspapers were burned, sprinklers When I went there, there was nothing to be rescued. After the symbolic sprinkling of water, the fire was naturally extinguished, and then a fee was paid to the fire station. For example, the cost of the police, the cost of overtime work, the cost of fire rescue, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
