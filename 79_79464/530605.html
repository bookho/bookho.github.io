			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere solidified again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf slowly turned his head and looked at the Buddha with his gun pointing at his head. The muscle fibers in his head made his brain blank. He opened his mouth slightly to show his shock, his eyes were a little scattered. For a while, he only came back to look at the Buddha with an incredible look. The tone of the conversation was like a full of grievances. "All Buddha, you are my friend, I introduced you to The fellowship, but you...now pointing at me with a gun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo and Graf are good friends, almost a little more than brothers, more friends than friends One point, if you run for a while, if Graf can help him once or twice, they will become brothers. However, when their relationship entered the fellowship in Dufo, they were so bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a little bit of heat, with the index finger and thumb, there may be only ten ten-dollar bills that are as thick as they are together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, Dudu is holding his gun on his head. He could feel the cool metal texture of the muzzle and could feel the heat from the grip behind the gun body. Dufo has opened the insurance, pushed the crystal into the catalytic chamber, and can pull the trigger to eject the bullet at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that, a month ago, Doolin and Dufo did not know at all, they might pass the street many times and never stop. Speak one or two sentences in the next step and get to know each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s him, he is Graff with Du Lin who knows so many Guarts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was him, the first to propose to build an organization to warm up the guars who need more help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He played a vital role, but now, his good friend, Buddha, with a gun on his head instead of pointing Doolin. He can't believe it, and he doesn't want to believe that why everyone is embarrassing themselves at this time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha looked at Graf with no expression, he didn't want to talk, but he felt that he should say something. He is no longer an ordinary member. He is the leader of the team and has a certain status and power in the association. At the same time, he does have some words to say. If you don't say it now, you may not have a chance to speak again in the future, so you can only regret yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are a whole!" This is the first sentence of the Buddha's opening. Du Lin nodded slightly. "As the boss said, how can you behave in the weekdays? Everyone can tolerate you, but when it happens so much. When you do things, you still act on your own character and ideas, and you can only hurt us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are a whole, but you can't integrate into us This whole is coming, so we are lying here with our six brothers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next time? Are you going to let here lay a few more? Five? Or ten Is it that even when I and the boss are lying here, will you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha grinned, "Grav We are friends, I know you. You can be a bad guy, but you can't be a bad guy, this is not your game, you should leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Graf is indeed a bad guy like the Buddha said. Sometimes he is quite unreasonable, sometimes very enthusiastic, and most of the time he is a very enthusiastic guy. No matter who is, as long as he is a Guar, regardless of men, women and children, as long as he finds him and asks for help, he will do his best to help those in need as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise he will not go to jail for helping others, otherwise the tycoon will not spend money to get him out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a good person, everyone trusts him, he has a good heart, so he can't be a bad person, can't do bad things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe he killed someone for everyone, maybe he can rush to the front line at some point, but he can't adapt to life here. Instead of struggling here, it is better to go back to the life he should have. Go ahead and do a bad guy who is a bit bad, instead of being a bad guy who can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf wants to refute and wants to say that he has already prepared for it, but he can’t say anything about how hard he tried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t say it, even if he thinks he’s ready, it’s just his “think”! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it...", the hoarse voice was grinded out of Graf's scorpion, with a noticeably rough graininess, and he looked at it somehow. Dudu, "Is it only prepared to abandon my loved ones?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin spoke up. "You said it was wrong, Graf." He took out a cigarette and pointed it at himself. He bounced his fingers. They all put up their pistols and walked to the corner and stood against the wall. Du Lin took out a lighter and made a few hits. He took a cigarette and took a deep breath. He spit out slowly. "You have not abandoned any relatives. From the day you join the fellowship, all of us are relatives!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a word, let the Buddha's heart tremble slightly, and see Graf's eyes more full of contradictions. What Du Lin said is not wrong. All the brothers and sisters of the fellowships are relatives. But in the eyes of Graf, his loved ones are his mother, his brother, not the six bastards on the ground who can't even breathe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grav snorted, "I don't mean this, I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin Suddenly stood up, obviously from the height, he is shorter than Graf, but the feeling of giving the Buddha is that he is many times taller than Graf, and even need to let him look up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action behind Graf was pulled up by Dooling in his throat, his lips moving, and no more openings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took the cigarette from the desk and walked to the front of Graf. He looked up at him and had a smile on his face. He actually opened his arms and hugged Graf, then gently patted his vest. "Well, it's time to go home, go to the life you yearn for. Even if you left here today, We are still your friend, your brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One day is a loved one, a lifetime is a loved one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Inexplicable, Graf suddenly lowered his head and closed his eyes. He had an inexplicable fever. He didn't know why there was an urge to cry. The last time there was such an impulse, it was when his cat was kicked to death by a passing horse on the side of the road. He felt that he should not be a vulnerable person. He was biased. At this time, he actually showed a kind of fragility that should not be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his shoulders, shook Du Lin and hugged his arm, turned and pushed the door away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the empty door, Doolin shook his head and walked back to the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
