			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"President Jason, thank you very much for taking the time to take a trip to the City Hall during your busy work, and then delay your time, no problem? "The character and style of Julio is still very southern, so that Jason does not know if this is the expression of Julio's dissatisfaction with him, or is it really polite." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a future Jason who wants to take root in the West to create his own great business empire, the mayor of Vanlier is the one he is currently offended . In fact, at 9:00 in the morning, he received a call from the City Hall asking him to go to the mayor's office as soon as possible to talk about the strike. He has been dragging it until now, not that he wants to do this, but not doing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strike was initiated by him. He listened to Mr. Doolin’s request and secretly let his men contact some of the more prestigious people in the working class and promoted The birth of the strike wave, and also accepted a fund of 100,000 yuan as the start-up capital when registering a new company, then he must do his best for Mr. Doolin. Now who doesn't know that Doolin is a well-educated person, many people speculate that Mr. Doolin may be involved in some serious crimes, but there is no evidence that Mr. Doolin is really involved in these cases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not terrible to discover the truth. It’s terrible that you’ve become part of the truth, so Jason tries to delay the time to think about how to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t call Doolin, this is his own idea. If you want to ask Du Lin for anything, he will gradually lose his independent authority. In the end, even if he is still a boss, he can actually become Du Lin's men. He doesn't like this. He wants someone who can decide his life, not someone who listens to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jason gripped Julio’s hand with a hint of apology. “I must apologize to you, Mayor of Julio. Now workers Their emotions are very exciting. I have been contacting some of them to keep them restrained and not to escalate the incident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julio guided Jason to sit down on the sofa and affirmed with approval. "You are doing very well. Controlling the non-expansion of the situation is good for us to solve the problem. Strike is not the most suitable solution. The only way to solve the problem is to have a more rational approach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Julio's "touting" Jason just smiled casually and didn't pay attention to it. Now Julio has a lot of troubles, but anyone who has a chance to solve these problems for him, saying something nice will not make him feel any trouble, anyway, don't spend money to say good things. But if you really take what he said, it’s really stupid. "As the president of the Western Workers’ Union, this is what I should do and must do."<br /><br />&nbsp "Mr. Maggs once said that the interests of the working class represent the interests of the mainstream groups of society. The responsibility and task of the workers' union is to unite the working class, guide the working class, and provide the necessary working class for all working classes. Help, avoid being persecuted by capitalists and ambitions, and ensure their attitudes and correctness of positions." This sentence is the establishment of workers by Magus when the workers’ union was reorganized by Doolin in the past few years. The instructions given by the new management of the class are now very appropriate for Jason to come up with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Hurio, he looked at Jason again, and there was a very wonderful thought in his heart. Before this person came to see him, A custom made very detailed preparation. His speculation is not untargeted. The Magnus leader has expressed his views and opinions on many things, but this kind of thing is more symbolic. This is like someone who has done a good thing to be praised. The praise itself does not have much practical significance. Except for those politicians, no one will keep the content of the praise in mind, always ready to take it out. Pressing one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he thinks that Jason has done his homework, which has also caused more delusions. This sudden strike covers the city and the number of people involved. As many as there will be workers’ unions in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strike is not the same as the strikes in other places before. It was a strike in other places, mostly organized by workers’ unions. Raising the head, and Julio learned from the side that the workers' union in the west had a frame left, and even the people who maintained normal work were not in the same place, so the workers' union was not included in the line of sight. But Jason’s performance made him have to reconsider what the Workers’ Union and Jason played in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jason certainly didn’t know that he had made enough preparations to make him show the biggest flaws. Julio continued quietly, “I’m very positive. The correctness of what the workers’ union is doing now is the reason why I found you. I hope that you can cooperate with the Vanlier City Hall to eliminate this strike as much as possible before the outbreak. What problems can we have? Negotiated and resolved. The damage caused by the strike is multifaceted. It not only hurts the working class itself, but also hurts many innocent citizens and citizens. It is definitely a heavy blow to the western economy that has just improved. We should avoid it. These situations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
