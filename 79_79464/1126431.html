			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Dulin’s threatening eyes, Delier stated the reason for his change, and that was a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been in the cultural circle of the Imperial Capital before he came to the city of Tener, and he has built a small personal art gallery. Of course, he was not engaged in it at that time. Women pimp business. In the place of the Imperial Capital, if he dared to do this, he would be found in the pool of a park the next morning, or he would be hanged on a street lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a certain relationship with a literary and art scam group, and has worked together on some things, and later left the list alone, with the help of some of the previous reputations. China and India have the titles of “connoisseurs” and “artists”. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a national political and cultural center, a considerable number of middle-class people in the capital of the capital hope that their children can develop in the arts - here specifically Those who have not studied well, after all, learning well or going to the Royal College is more promising. Only children who can't learn can develop into art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art This thing has no boundaries, even if the master is smeared in the shoe box, it can also be called "passionate post-modern abstract art", and also Affirmed by many connoisseurs and artists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a title like a master of art is easy to eat in society, and this is also a way of getting into the middle class and the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreil took advantage of the family’s helplessness and expectations for the children, opened an art class, charged high tutoring fees, and issued some A letter of recommendation for them to get invitations from certain art schools. As for whether it can be admitted, it is another question, at least he has proved his worth from here. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for him to be discovered by his parents, he would be embarrassed to teach some of the children in the process of teaching them. Maybe he has become a first-class master of art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the reason why he changed back from a mother gun was related to a little girl who had been beaten by him. When accompanied Mrs. Vivian's participation in the Imperial Women's Rights Conference, he saw the little girl again. Over the past ten years, the little girl has matured, and the two have been filled with a sly atmosphere until the little girl rudely pushed Delier into the bathroom and then what Delier had done to her. After revenge on Delier, the door to the new world was closed and the old world door opened again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell in love, and the girl who had been jealous of him and passed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked up and down Delier after listening to it, patted his shoulder and said a few words, which made Delier somewhat flattered, even thank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little later, the Buddha came out of power. If an outstanding painter used the postmodern artistic expression to paint the Buddha, he might It is a scarecrow, or a pole. As he sighed, he sighed and ignored Du Lin's ridiculous eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already talked briefly with Vivienne about Fred’s situation. Unexpectedly, Vivienne did not have any excessive performance, she just And Du Lin negotiated a deal, this time is not suitable for this little thing to ignite, and then these things can also explain that Fred and Doolin's two children get along well, which is what she is willing to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Doolin and Ophelia are married, his future is absolutely incalculable, and Magus will support him, even if Magus will retreat in two years. Off, Du Lin will certainly have a terrible future. Being able to deepen the relationship at the end of the micro-end is far more valuable than the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of Doolin after a return to Otis from Cannes is temporarily calm for a few days, in the first week of July, July 7 On the day he will be holding an engagement ceremony with Ophelia, the reason is July 7th, because it was just a sunny day. Prior to this, there was also a charity party, which was held in the name of Doolin, and donated property rights to the city government of Otis, as well as a charity fundraiser. Natiya donated money anyway, and donated so much, it’s better to get things done, not only contacted several charitable foundations, but also contacted the church. At that time, these people will send people. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Add Merlin's name to him and let him come over." Du Lin put the invitation list back on the table, at the side of Nam Lindes Including the officials of the Imperial Capital and the state government, the style of Natiya is very much like that of Doolin. Even if she doesn't do this, Du Lin will let her make this donation into a huge charity event. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much money must be made to create a public opinion effect of sufficient weight, so that everyone knows that Du Lin is a socially responsible entrepreneur and It is important for future politicians to establish a perfect image for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the business talks, Du Lin glanced at Natiya and curiously asked, "You seem to be a little tired, sick?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya shook his head I smiled and said that I was very good, but after waiting for a while, she suddenly spoke and talked about her own private affairs. "I don't know what to do, maybe you can give me a better suggestion." "And then she talked about what happened to her recently." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Walter divorced Walt disappeared from her life and stayed with the young girl. But during this time, Walter appeared again, asking her for forgiveness and having the meaning of wanting to compound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt and her lived with the girl after divorce, he thought it would be the beginning of his new life, but never thought that this is actually the end of the dream . When the girl knew that the villa he had lived in was not his, and he didn’t have much money, the two soon broke out and ended the relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lost Walt returned to his home and found a job. After more than half a year of hard work, he finally got the approval of his superiors. His monthly income. Increased to fifty-nine dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the poor few banknotes in his hand, he suddenly realized that his divorce with Natiya was the biggest mistake in life. This is not enough money. Natiya used to give him pocket money every week. For a good life, he found a lot of ways to find the address of Natiya now, then found Natiya and wrapped her around to pray for compounding, and used the child as an excuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin dumbfounded, didn't expect it to be such a small thing, but he soon realized that this was not a small thing. A good woman is afraid of being a man, this is the most true sentence in his dream world. How many good girls are planted in the word, and Walt’s divorce mentality is definitely out of balance. His performance and his true thoughts are not necessarily It is coincident, it will be a danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will assign this to me, I will arrange for someone to deal with it." Du Lin raised his hand and slammed the two desktops and took it. come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya wants to stop and say nothing, and finally nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a later time, Natiya was ready to go back, but Du Lin took the initiative to join her, which also made Natiya realize what she was not sure about. Doing right or wrong, can face the strength of Du Lin, the swaying mind is gradually biased towards Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their car had not yet entered the docking area outside the villa. Du Lin saw a middle-aged man standing outside the villa. He looked awkward, his beard had not been cleaned, a cigarette was in his mouth, and some The lonely man sucked the smoke against the lamppost. Hearing the sound of the car approaching, he looked up and looked at the car not far away, and there were some pleasing smiles on his face. He dropped half of the cigarettes on the ground, and then sorted the collar and walked toward the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Natiya had just said, Du Lin stopped her and gave her a peace of mind, laughing and saying, "I will handle it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car is slowly leaning to the side, but the first one to open the door is not Natiya, but Du Lin, which makes Walter somewhat inexplicable anger. He knows Doolin, from the newspaper, from the mouth of the public, and also listens to Natiya that she is now serving Du Lin. But no woman has ever served the boss and served home, and with Doolin's growing temperament, there is something in Walt's heart that he can't describe is tearing his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undulating chest of his undulations heralded anger in his body. He licked his fist and stood on the sidelines watching Dulin open for Natiya. The door, and holding her hand, he even looked at Du Lin and kissed Natiya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bastard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is his wife, only he can kiss her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, Du Lin’s ostentation and irony in his eyes turned Walter out of his madness, and he was still showing off what he was doing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a trace of calm in my mind that does not let Walter attack immediately. His body is slightly trembling and watching the dogs and men lock the door, standing In front of yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took Natiya’s waist and had a natural and friendly smile. He also took the initiative to reach out to Walt, "Mr. Walter, no. When I think of seeing you here, can I help you?" He looked at Natiya. "You go ahead, I talk to Mr. Walter, and I will pass later." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya looked at Doolin with some worries, nodded, and nervously left, but she didn’t know, Doolin’s words and her actions. More exciting Huat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
