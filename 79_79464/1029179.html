			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people who know the organization of Scarlet Dawn in the empire. For more than 20 years, the age of people can’t wash away the immersed in hell. Time, in the last period of the imperial glory of the empire, is active in many familiar people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a robber who specialized in robbing the rich to help the poor. He plundered the noble gold and silver utensils of the nobles and gave them to the poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are kidnappers who specialize in kidnapping nobles and wealthy businessmen. They snatch countless wealth from nobles and wealthy businessmen, and give them to the poor who have no money to see a doctor or live. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a well-known female road tyrant who always reveals the upper body of her red fruit after robbing the aristocrats crossing the road, telling these people that they are being weak The women robbed and used this to humiliate the nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in all the rumors, the most powerful is the bloody dawn, in fact people were more willing to call them "red dawn" at that time. A philosopher once said that when the red flame that dominates the sky ignites the first light of the sky, the night will be the past and the dawn will be ahead. Later, it was said that the philosopher was accused by the nobles of being infected with the bloody dawn, and was finally hanged in the square of a certain city. Many people may still remember it, because the guy was still smiling when he died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original numb audience at that moment is like suddenly waking up from a dream, they have no sorrow, no pain, they shouted with tears Singing and singing free songs. Because they suddenly understood a truth, this is not a victory for the nobility, because the nobles are afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, the empire has stipulated that hanged must wear hoods, and that these damned death penalty prisoners should not be allowed to reveal any news before dying. Perhaps this story tells us that when a person with a "D" in his name is sentenced to execution, he must not only wear a hood for him, but also block his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the bloody dawn is remembered is because in the history of the entire empire, only they dare to kill the aristocrats on a large scale. Every nobleman who has been black carded, whether he is a baron who has just been promoted, or a duke who has been inherited for more than a dozen generations or more, will not be spared because of their status power or wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no escape, this is the source of fear of the nobles against the dawn of the blood, they will never let any nobles who are targeted by them continue to live in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin said these words, many people in the room jumped in the eyelids. Many people know that the Mennon and the bloodstream are related, but there are not many people who know that the Mennon and the Scarlet Dawn have a relationship. It is a secret. One is almost the same as the public secret at the top of the Imperial Tower. At the thought of this, many people’s steadfast attitudes immediately swayed sharply. The degree of the news was so exaggerated that they were a little bit sloppy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the empire has entered a new era under the leadership of Magus and the New Party, in this new era, Magus or New Party The top level is also full of old aristocrats. Moreover, in the north where the noble powers are best preserved, it seems that the two worlds are completely different from the south. Before the arrival of the new era, the aristocrats were everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These people are enemies with the doormen, because the inheritance history of the nobility itself is a hodgepodge that may not be clear, maybe a baron’s sister is married Another duke, the wife of the Duke's child is a member of the royal family. Among the members of the royal family, except for the determined successors, they almost all match or marry the sons of the nobility. In the bloody fusion of generations, perhaps all the nobles are actually distant relatives of each other. This is not a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why do you know that the Mennon is a bloody dawn, and let him make such a big achievement in the West? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all businessmen here, and the things they are exposed to are obviously more advanced than the things that ordinary people have come into contact with, no matter what, including conspiracy. Inside. For a moment, their minds extended a kind of thinking. The new and old empire of the empire did this in order to make the doorman a bait and fish out the people with bloody dawn behind him. Then these people and the doormen have formed a cooperative relationship, will they be suspected of becoming a bloody dawn? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seemingly amiable Magus leader was standing on the steps that were flush with the emperor, and the emperor read the constitutional reform and read the cabinet. And finally handed over all the power in hand! It was a politician who ate no bones... No, it was a politician. There may be no idioms in the world after the fall, but there are similar sentences full of wisdom - the day of the autumn harvest is the best day to pay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the farmers are liquidated, their investment may be cut down, they will suffer unparalleled losses, and then enter the gray life path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos swallowed. "Are you sure everything you said is true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Du Lin’s booth shrugged and shrugged his shoulders. “Why should I lie? And the doorman has just made the most wrong decision in his life. He expressed his longing for the new life to the empire and completely cut off the past. The connection. The importance of a bait is that it attracts the precious fish to the angler, but when the bait indicates that it will never attract the fish, it is when the angler changes a bait."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He lost his value. If he could not obey the will of the cabinet in a short time, he only had one end!" Du Lin raised a finger and looked around in a circle. Everyone, their eyes stayed on them one by one, and finally said in a very positive tone: "That is being liquidated!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is like a hand The hammer hit the chest of everyone, making their chest boring, heart rate imbalance, uncomfortable Not unspeakable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, once such a thing happens, the entire western region will immediately become a mess of wheat, which is more chaotic than now. The doorman has infiltrated his own tentacles these years. In all aspects of the West, he was liquidated, and many of the policies currently in the West, as well as many laws, including the investment of all, will be a thing of the past. Everything they pay for it will be slammed on the ground and broken into pieces that can no longer be spliced ​​together. This is no longer a word of risk. This is a thunderstorm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost everyone thinks that Magnus’ attitude towards capital is enough to make them tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, Mr. Doolin, what method do you have to save such a disturbing situation? Have you thought about how to proceed to solve this problem? "The speaker is called Sith. It is one of the largest construction machinery manufacturers in the empire. They are now involved in the military industry, and there has been a competition with the Bondika Military Group." And this is also thanks to the military industrial group headed by Bondika for completely eliminating the AT-1 weapon-loading platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lages Engineering Machinery Group intervened in the AT-1 weapon-mounted platform to increase the civilian interface, and also designed some engineering arms. It can be said that their design is very successful and has taken a big step forward in their own field. It was also when they participated in the project that they found that there was not much difference between the weapons-equipped platforms and their construction machinery, and even some technologies were still lagging behind the overall design of their civil engineering machinery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gave the chairman and the largest shareholder of the group company. Mr. Lagnos was a great inspiration. Why didn’t they add more accessories to the engineering machinery that they could only sell for tens of thousands of tens of thousands, and sold them as a military platform? Hundreds of thousands of prices? The huge profits generated by this made Mr. Ragnos red eyes. He used to think that the military platform was very complicated, but he did not expect it to be so backward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the face of more various metal gaps, Lagnos Engineering Machinery Group arranged a Western agent to provide as much as possible for the group company. More resources to reduce the additional costs of imports. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if there is no Doolin, Mr. Sith will never sit with Carlos, they have no common language at all, all commercial enemies are The dead enemy, this sentence makes sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s eyes are on Du Lin’s body, and Du Lin gently clicked on his head. “I’m asking questions, there will definitely be a solution, I Not a mathematician, not a scientist, always getting some questions that people can't even read and then ask them how to solve them. I am not that stupid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is actually a very simple question. The problem itself is on Mr. Mennon. If Mr. Mennon is in prison because he has lost his power because of certain things, even..." Du Lin said I stopped here. Everyone stretched out his neck and wanted to hear what he had to say. He smiled lightly. "Even if Mr. Mennon accidentally made an accident and died for the country, then I believe that the cabinet is not sure. The campaign will be launched in the west."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When a big tree fell, all the birds flew into the sky, and the value of the tree did not exist. No matter whether it is good or bad, then no one will care about this tree again. What to do for the forest, what can be done for the animals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Mr. Mennon cannot continue his current job because of his physical condition, I will work with Mag Mr. Si talked to ensure the stability of the west."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is very red fruit told everyone, the doorman should almost exit the stage of the empire, bloody However, it did not make any person's face look like it should not appear. Some people even nodded secretly and felt that what Du Lin said was feasible. When the Mennon died, the little leaders did not have room for survival. They were like a group of birds that perched on the big tree of the Mennon. They all flew far away, and who would care about this dead tree. Forest? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
