			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Perito is a branch president of Southern Commercial Bank, and Julio was in the same city before, when Julio and Perito The relationship between them is very good. The game of capital in the southern city is not only the professional skills of the merchants, but also well known to government officials and banks. Someone once commented on the officials of the Southern Department, saying that they know better than the merchants how to use the advantages of their hands to make more partners, and work together in many fields to achieve economic success in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a more civilized and implicit statement. If it is straightforward and rude, it is that the South has a very good set of collusion between officials and businessmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Hall uses merchants to pass on risks, and merchants use the bank's capital saving funds to expand profits. Banks obtain stable interest through borrowing while deepening cooperation with the government. It's like a solid iron triangle. No one can do without it. Everyone has already formed a game game that is not well known. So Julio had a good relationship with the president of the Southern Commercial Bank, Bailito, where he served, and they worked together many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before sending Jason, Jason just vaguely shirked his responsibility. He thought that a more authoritative person or organization could solve the current trouble. In fact, the purpose of this sentence is that Jason created momentum for Du Lin, and he wanted to follow Du Lin to have such an idea. In his eyes, Du Lin was the authoritative person. Now he gave Perito a shot. After a period of time, the situation continued to deteriorate. Du Lin took advantage of the current rotten apples in his own pot. It's more convenient and more convincing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Jason ignored two questions. First of all, this was his unsuccessful decision. He did not say hello to Doolin. If he greets Du Lin and tells Doolin how to prepare himself, Du Lin will never let him say such stupid and mentally handicapped words. The unique social environment and economic ecosystem of the South have created many new eras of wealthy people. Most of these rich people have made their fortunes through thrilling capital means, and they have brought something that is not legal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know everything about the game of money, and many capital rules are even made by them. In such an environment, Julio is very knowledgeable and familiar with the means of capital under the guise of deafness. Once he finds the fulcrum, it is easy to resolve the current crisis. In fact, the strike is now good, and it’s just a matter of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town hall can't afford to solve the current troubles. The people who participated in the three-guarantee policy don't mind accepting the loss of expected value, but if there is a person with sufficient strength to stand up and adjust the center, it will easily calm down. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this is also Jason’s subconscious hedging action. Du Lin asked him to contact the workers’ representatives to launch this huge momentum, covering the entire western region. Super strike. Once things get out of control, it is very likely to cause terrible damage and influence. At that time, he will definitely be sold by the workers' representatives. Then he needs a little self-protection at this time. He can tell Julio that he actually reminded him that he was behind the scenes many days ago, but Julio is "arrogant". I ignored his reminder, so he should not take on too many responsibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Jason couldn’t think of it, he actually destroyed Doolin’s plan and pointed out a direction for Julio! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Perito is dining, he is hosting a few very special guests, the local super rich. The bank president and the rich are always the closest couple, and even if the above policies are so harsh, they cannot break the relationship between the two. If the caller is not Julio, Perito will not pick up at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very sorry, I have an important phone call, I am temporarily missing!", Perito touched the grease on her mouth and succumbed to a slight sin. Go straight to the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed the door, made a phone call, and the calm facial expression suddenly became warm, and even the tone was filled with a long-awaited surprise. Mr. Chang, how can I call me today? I thought that this call will not appear until at least half a month." He laughed when he finished speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of solutions for Julio, "I invited you to come with me when I left, but you don't want to, Otherwise, we should sit face to face now instead of talking over the telephone line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The West is the place I know more than you, our game The rules don't work there. Even if I'm gone, it won't be long before I come back. It's better to wait for your call. I believe this should be good news!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The poverty and backwardness and old-fashionedness in the west have left the southern commercial banks unable to open there. The Southern Commercial Bank is a joint bank established by the southern bankers. In the early days, these bankers fought each other, one east and one west. Private banks are spread throughout the South and have not been reorganized into the current Southern Commercial Bank. Later, the imperialist central bank has already perceived the dangers of these bankers – locals support local banks far more than the imperialist central bank because local banks are owned by locals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, some things that seem to be troublesome in the imperial central bank are well resolved in local banks, and social relationships that can never be undone in society, so local banks have quietly risen. To this end, the imperialist central bank began to suppress these small banks, and their means are also very simple, that is, this injury. This injury is always the favorite thing for businessmen, because this method does not have any technical content, high success rate, low risk rate, and is deeply loved by business people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called insult is to use sufficient funds to step by step, and finally let the enemy destroy themselves. This approach sounds a bit complicated, but it is very simple. Take gambling as an example. There is a billion chips in front of A. There is a stack of chips in front of B. Each round has an underscore. Each round A bets on the total amount of B. It doesn't matter how many times A loses, the loss is always within his tolerance, but for B, no matter how many times he wins, as long as he loses, all the money on his counter will become A. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the pressure on B in such a hand makes him must be very careful every step of the way, clearly that he has a great chance of winning, but the odds are not When he reached 100%, he did not dare to gamble easily. In the repeated attempts, either because the gambling is wrong, all the money is lost, or nothing is harvested in the forced ante. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same was true of the imperial central bank at the time. They were very despicable to use themselves as the empire’s largest economy, secretly allowing people to store large quantities in these private banks. Deposits, then take the initiative to tighten interest rates, allowing more money to flow in the market. By the time they gather enough intelligence to support their actions, they go looking for banks that have just invested a lot of money in a certain area to cash in. It is well known that only one-third of the depositors' money is deposited in the bank as a reserve deposit, and the rest of the money is profitable through borrowing or investment. This is also the main means for banks to make a profit. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sudden redemption and the rumors that have arisen in society make it impossible for them to meet the requirements of depositors, the disaster will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All business conduct has nothing to do with morality, good friends in the past will step on them, and those partners will step on them, these private In addition to the bankruptcy and liquidation, the bank has no second way to go. Some people even revealed some news that they felt angry and feared, saying that the imperialist central bank took the initiative to deploy in the south, attracting investment from private banks with short-term and short-term projects with small risks and quick returns. As long as they put the money in, the imperial central bank will immediately Launched a run on the run and ran into the bankruptcy of these private banks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
