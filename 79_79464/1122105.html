			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most people’s impressions, the first date for men and women must create a romantic atmosphere, such as the use of peerless empire – always pretending to be a rose and getting The world-recognized rose, and dinner with candlelight red wine, and a little more emotional stuff, all together seem to be the best first date, to give each other the best impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Du Lin is different. Du Lin has a different head than ordinary people. He can't create any romantic atmosphere, nor does it fill the girl. In the mood of the environment, he said that he was weak and soft, and he took the girl to the slums of the lower city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Hall of the Imperial City has never mentioned in the publicity that the emperor has a lower city, and there are places like slums, which directly cover up this fact. In fact, there are poor people in the imperial capital, there are sub-districts, and there are slums that are not much different from other cities. The solidification of the social class means that a large amount of effective wealth will gradually be lost from the majority to the hands of a few people. This is an irreversible process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person has a savings of one hundred dollars, he can not eat or drink without any expenditure, then he prevented the loss of wealth in his hands to other places. ? Of course not, he can't stop it. Every year, the newly added currency and inflation make his one hundred pieces continually depreciate. Even if he doesn't eat, drink, or spend money, his wealth is still losing. So this has caused some families who are poor and do not have a relatively high salary to work in an unstoppable life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more developed regions, the more obvious this phenomenon is, the expansion of the overall wealth of society does not include such a group of people in the process of wealth, in the wealth of others In the process, they contributed the rich energy of others. Over time, these people are obviously working very hard, but they are inexplicably getting poorer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus God is obviously higher than other places of consumption, so some families that could be said to be not poor ten years ago or 20 years ago, Under the ruthless impact of the years, it finally became a poor family. Fortunately, there is another organization in the Royal Capital that has been caring for them, and that is the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sunset City is the home base of the church, but in the politically advanced Yaoxing Empire, the church also has a cathedral in the capital, they have been helping the poor. The royal family, including the cabinet, has always been very disgusted with the church. This group of gods who once ruled the world through zheng teaching and unification has always been the object of caution. But they have been really providing the necessary help for some difficult families. Giving is the main reason why the poor can live in the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every week, the church will distribute some old clothes, furniture and other messy things together with food to the poor, so that they can continue to support them in exchange for more people's support. These jobs are not only done during the interview, they will always do this as long as there is no external interference, and continue to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people say that the church is a group of hypocritical gods, but hypocrisy to this extent, perhaps this is why there are people who believe in the church because they Too "hypocritical" is also used to maintaining "hypocrisy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took the girl to several malls first, bought a lot of ordinary clothes, and a lot of food, in the girl’s inexplicable confusion, Du Lin She was taken to an orphanage and welfare home hosted by several churches in the slums. When she was in a state of ignorance, after Du Lin took her hand and stood at the table where the relief was distributed, almost mechanically distributed what was brought to every child, every person who needed help, and got After they were thankful from the heart, the girl suddenly seemed to be an epiphany. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She began to take the initiative to participate, the children's eyes that are as clear as crystal without a trace of impurities make her feel a kind of depression that can not breathe, this It also made her see the other side of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all descendants of aristocratic families have been vying for fame since childhood, and not everyone is white lotus. Du Lin did a full investigation. Make such a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family of Magus...Timamont, and the pronunciation of Ogding, read it in Simmamont, if this family is not Magus Being is actually not very conspicuous. In the past many years, in addition to inheriting the title of the ancestors, the Timamont family rarely has a particularly famous family member. Most of them are relatively mediocre. Occasionally, several characters with outstanding performance appear, and they will be more powerful at the same time. The light emitted by the characters is covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this family has a small problem, the ability to breed offspring is not as good as some families born in the world famous for children, one family or two offspring It is the limit, and there are at most three children. Magus had only one younger sister, and he only had two children. This is rare among the great aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of families of direct descendants in each generation compared to the Diplecius family. The Timamont family does not make a difference in its ability to multiply. On the strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
