			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, they asked me to come to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is very familiar, but Freena did not have any excessive communication with this person outside the door. The outside person was her classmate and she was still a female classmate. Freena knows why these little girls will crowd out themselves. She doesn't have any thoughts other than being funny. Everyone is not a world person. When these girls mature, they will understand how naive they are doing today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freina quickly opened the door, the girl outside the door dressed up, wearing a very fashionable winter coat, and wearing some sparkling jewelry. The girl is called Kairis Baikafu. She has several mines in the west and a steel mill. It is not the first purpose for Mr. Lao Baikafu to send her to study here. The first purpose is to reach out to some high-level social people and find suitable springboards for the future development of the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there something?", Freena put on a nightdress, she stood in the door and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerris shrugged and slammed his feet. "Inviting you to go out and play. After all, we are still in class yesterday, and tomorrow is just a break, everyone said Go out for a while together.", said she looked at the side of the corridor, and turned back and said: "We are all classmates, all of a class, we are the whole, we should also act together!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very naive idea, Freina originally wanted to refuse, but Kerris impressed her in the next sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that we sometimes do something too much, now we understand, give us a chance, a chance to ease the relationship, if you know this is a kind Apologize is OK!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena smiled a little and thought, "Well, wait for me to change my clothes."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerris waved his arm and ran to the side. Freena thought about it. This time she went out to play, so I don’t need to wear it so formal. These young people may choose some more lively. In the entertainment venue, she quickly picked up her own clothes, drew a simple makeup, and left the dormitory with Xiao Kun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, more than forty classmates in the class stood alone outside the dormitory, and the dormitory administrators did not see them. When I saw Freena coming out, everyone was very eager to say hello, and many people were excited to exclaim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is not difficult to think that the excitement of these children is no reason. At their age, it is the best age in life, and it is also the stage of the most desires and impulses. For those ugly desires and impulses, for the time being, most of the young people at this time will have a small problem, that is, vanity, or show off. They all have very good family history, or they can't get 100,000 pieces to enter the imperial royal college gilded, so they care more about some superficial things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, girls often compare accessories to each other, such as some of the gadgets that boys compare, and today they will carry a very famous The actress goes out to play together. If I meet some acquaintances, friends or something, it will definitely rise. Coupled with their love of the nature, I feel that this evening will be a pleasant evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena and everyone greeted and walked outside the Royal College. On the way she talked to the girls a lot, from their own costumes. The collocation, the feeling in front of the camera when acting, almost everything. The girls seem to have really realized their past childish behavior and seem to be very harmonious with Freina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the outside of the school, take the car of Kairis, they headed for the largest bar in the capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Du Lin is also sitting in a bar with a few people talking about the sky. The George family's industry has now all been transferred to his personal name, but these industries have not yet fully taken over, on the one hand, some places do not use, such as Du Lin, such as villa estates, can not move in, If you let someone else live, it feels a bit unreasonable. He needs to arrange some people to take care of his houses here, as well as three houses in the city center of the Imperial City. Until now, the horrible situation after the fire has been maintained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two Doolins that have been used, but there is currently no specific arrangement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When chatting with Magus, he made a small difference in the middle of the road. With an idea, can you make a museum, a wine culture museum, and a western country? The wines are displayed on the inside and can be served for everyone if necessary. In addition to the positive propaganda of the need for life, the gradual unraveling of the high-pressure policy of the prohibition of alcohol, so that more people realize that wine is a necessity of life, not a harmful thing, here can also be used as Du Lin in the future. The Imperial City is a guesthouse for guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is accurate to say that Du Lin currently does not have a stronghold in the capital, and Nasha traded his estate and villas for years, no matter how many years of change, it is still an industry that once belonged to the George family. When Du Lin used these two places to entertain others, others would inevitably think of the original owners of the two industries when they entered, and they would also think of what Du Lin did in the collapse of the George family and what he played. Character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s definitely not a place to entertain others, but the three buildings in the city centre are different, and their nature is not like that of manors and villas. Living, but commercial. The biggest characteristic of a commercial nature industry is its strong liquidity. Most families sell some assets when adjusting their family business structure or business strategy. This is a normal phenomenon, and people will not associate these things with the George family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin found the agents of the Imperial Capital and the club president of the fellowship, and they planned to let them repair the three houses first, and then The museum is set up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As their own boss and president, the agents here discussed with the club president, and the location of the reception of Doolin was set in the most luxurious of the Imperial City. In the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security environment of the Imperial Capital and the superiority of the imperial citizen’s unparalleled superiority did not make the bar here more expensive than other places, maybe the music is more Soothing, and there are reminders in the bar that smoking is prohibited and the logo of the fungus and gecko products is forbidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women who are prone to sweat on the stage have become women from primitive tribes. They live in places where they can't even do their clothes. They can only use some pearls. Or sparkling things are worn together as clothes to cover as much as possible the parts of the body that are not easily exposed to the public. However, their practice is obviously useless. The owner of the bar gives them a lot of salary to dance hard. When the body movements are slightly larger, the bulingbuling things will churn and the audience will peep. When it comes to the privacy of others, they are red-faced, and some people can't stand the whistle and remind them to protect themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bar is also selling the same high-alcohol wines as other places, and they will be bolder and more generous to sell, instead of using "oral disinfection medical supplies" To confuse the concept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boss, do you know that the two producers in the West are fighting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking about the matter here, the agent of the Imperial Capital said something that Du Lin was interested in. The manufacturer he said refers to the manufacturer of the patents that Du Lin authorized to use to purify the alcohol concentration by distillation. These people spontaneously made outstanding contributions to the Doolin purification private wine industry. At the same time, these authorized parties maximized their profits as much as possible. They frantically suppressed those small workshops and ensured that they had enough market for the drinks they produced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, their existence has not only affected Du Lin, but will benefit Du Lin. Du Lin's wholesale wines for these agents are infinitely close to the cost price, especially in the recent period, the inflation of the empire is slightly faster, so that he still has some profitable sales into cost price sales. It can be said that his wines are sold to agents more, and he can't make any money. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite is the fact that these fifteen producers have acquired a lower cost and more efficient winemaking method through Doolin’s patents, and they produce a large number of products. Need to be sold through Du Lin's already established sales channels, then they not only have to pay an expensive channel fee, but also need to leave enough profit margins for agents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will lose money to sell, and it’s less likely that the hidden trust of the terminal, like a channel dealer, will not make money or make less money, so in general Du Lin not only There is no loss, but it is more profitable than being covered with goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin put down the glass, there is some silver light flowing in the dark blue liquid like the night sky, this wine is called starry sky, invented star air conditioning wine formula The bartender just sold the formula and he was already rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?", Du Lin took out a cigarette and took a cigarette. The club president immediately took out the lighter for Doolin. "I remember their The site is already well-distributed, and it is not necessary if you want to grab the market."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agent very much agrees to nod. "This is indeed the case." I heard that several large mines were discovered in the west near the Yagur Mountains. Over three or four months, more than 200,000 miners and capitalists poured into the area. Before this, Yagur was a ridiculous place. Now with so many people and such a big market, it will definitely attract their attention. Originally this place is in the middle of the two manufacturers, they have played several games in order to decide who this area belongs to!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin suddenly understood that these manufacturers are not really good things. When they are subject to Doolin, they naturally obey the rules of Doolin. The channel itself is a very special thing. They want to establish new channels without any problems, but this has violated the interests of Doolin, but they still do not want to fight with Doolin, so they can only passively accept it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the original market of Yagur was suddenly appeared, it immediately attracted the idea of ​​two people. In the western part of the country, the sales speed of the wine is actually much faster than other places. A lot of miners work in the wet underground, they need spirits to get rid of the cold, and the boring life needs to find a spiritual comfort, then explore a certain threshold compared to a few dollars and skilled women. In a few minutes of change, it is better to use two or three dollars to buy a low-quality wine to maintain a minimum of two or three days of spiritual satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no agent for Doolin here, and there are more than 160,000 miners here, each of which consumes three dollars a week, then there are two hundred in a month. After 10,000 of the turnover, after eliminating the cost that has been reduced to the freezing point, they can at least earn about 80% of the profit, 40%, about 7800,000 a month, enough for many people to desperately It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not express any opinion on this. If these manufacturers can eliminate themselves within a certain range, it is the best thing, avoiding others in the future. He hit the face too broadly and ate the ugly drawbacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They like to play and let them play, help me to send a message out, I don’t have any desire for the personal market of Yagur Mountain..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a waiter came over, he smiled slightly and owed a little, "Gentlemen, this place is banned from smoking, can you...", he The words have not been finished yet, and the two guys in formal suits on the outside of the deck stood up and blocked in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The service stunned, he glanced at the two big heads in front of him, and glanced at the guests sitting in the deck through the gap between them. Immediately after a quick sigh, I quickly left. In the Imperial Capital, there are always some people who are different and special. These people do not necessarily dare to offend each other even if the police chief comes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, as the largest and most luxurious bar in the capital, the boss himself has a certain amount of energy, otherwise the bar has long been a ruin, waiting for the day when the property is re-auctioned. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin regained his gaze from the waiter and continued: "What is the emperor's side? How is the sales situation?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agent said with a sigh of relief: "Our opponents are still there." According to your request, we have reduced their living space, but they have survived. Soil, now in the market share of the Imperial Capital, we control nearly half of the market share!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
