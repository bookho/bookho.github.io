			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the team leader invited Du Lin to the City Hall of Villier to talk about some new initiatives, such as these will be saved The placement of the slaves came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that Du Lin quickly sent his picture to the front of thousands of households with the help of tape, with the economic improvement and technical update. In the future, the price of this thing that Du Lin called TV as has dropped from more than 3,000 to 899. Perhaps this money is still a bit expensive for most ordinary people, but it has begun to be normal for families with middle class and above income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of this year, the income of the middle class family published by the Imperial Ministry of Finance, the income of middle-class families has risen from the average of 41 yuan per person five years ago. At the cost of seventy-eight dollars, as long as both husband and wife are working in a family, their monthly income is about 130 to 150, and they can save 40 to 8 for various expenses. Ten pieces are not equal. Buying a TV set a year is not a luxury. As the content of tapes increases, middle-class families are almost ready to give up access to newspapers from other places. Of course, local newspapers still have to buy. Nowadays, the most famous tapes of the Empire Star and the Star Empire are only one roll per week, which cannot meet the requirements of the middle-class family for daily news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a TV set, it will naturally look to the tape, the cost and technology of the tape is more and more advanced, especially the line filling machine and the new carrier material. As soon as it appeared, the cost of the tape industry began to shrink sharply, releasing a huge profit margin, allowing these tape companies to play the price war happily. The price of tape has been reduced from thirty-five in the Doolin period to seven in nine, which has caused many small-scale tape companies to go bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such a huge market influence, more and more people choose to understand the world through tape, and let them see Du Lin in the previous tape Very infectious interview. Everyone is very concerned about the many problems that these illegal immigrants will face, such as how to resettle them, whether their living conditions and treatment in the empire can provide them with equal legal rights as imperial citizens, and the society also splits two camps. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first camp is optimistic that these people believe that hosting the resettlement and giving them the legitimate rights and interests of these illegal immigrants is a symbol of imperial benevolence and love. These people are already very Unlucky, can't say to save them from the mine, send them home in a blink of an eye, which is unfair to them, and they may become extreme people. In the eyes of their families, they may be doing decent work in the outside world to make money, and no one will feel that their loved ones will be arrested and become slaves when they leave their hometown to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sending them back to their country will not only make them difficult to survive, but will also have a great impact on the image of the empire. It is possible that through their propaganda empire, they will be a horrible image in the eyes of nationals of other countries. And barbaric, full of all kinds of backward systems, this will have a great impact on the empire and on the imperial citizens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who hold this part of the attitude are often the middle-high class in society, who already have enough to eat and have warm clothes and have money to reflect themselves. In the middle and high-class class of existence, image, decent, culture, and institution are often things that they value more. They are the mainstay of society and the fulfillers of the Empire Dream. They have a higher perspective on the issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course there are another group of people who have objections. The ghost knows whether these illegal immigrants will be persecuted because they are being slaves. The mentality, for example, wants to gain the pleasure of revenge by hurting the citizens of the empire. These people are seriously insecure. They also organized a parade to send these people back to their own country and hometown, and not let them stay in the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this part of the people, often the lower class and the proletariat, because there is no money in the pocket, there is no deposit in the bank, facing a higher society than the middle class Stress, they are less able to withstand risks, and they want to have a relatively quiet and risk-free life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, everyone is paying attention to this matter. As the investigation team settled in the west, the mine owners of one mining area began to release their slaves, and Provide a specific population to the City Hall of the City of Ville, where the investigation team is located. These illegal immigrants have been well placed for temporary resettlement. They also live in the slave camps where they used to live, but the environment they live in now has a very different performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are free to leave the mining area, work in the mines, and get at least two new sets of clothes, as well as rich and delicious meals. No one is forcing them to mine again. Even if they are actively mining, the miners must settle their pay as required by the salary system of the Imperial miners. It can be said that they have fully acquired everything owned by imperial citizens, and even more than the powers and obligations of imperial citizens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t need money for medical treatment, the mine owners will pay for them, they don’t need to spend money to buy things, because the farmers and the grocery stores will be the owners Settlement, such a life makes them feel very unreal, very illusory, and they are waiting for nothing, waiting for the final judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Du Lin, the countermeasures you put forward during the interview have been recognized by the cabinet. This time, when I came to the west, the Magus leader asked me if I had something that could not be solved. I must ask you more. Now we are still before. The question, how do you think these people are going to be placed?" The inspection team leader was very polite, and he was able to feel faintly that the reason for Magus’s change of attitude toward the doorman was on this young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A controllable Mennon and Kadima Party, significantly better than an uncontrolled and often frightened Duolin Group, he sat in the room and Du When Lin faced the face, he realized that if the doorman left, the next person to take over the position of the doorman would most likely be Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years ago, people only referred to Du Lin as Doolin, but today, three years later, when people talk about Doolin, they tend to After his name, he added the title of "group" or "interest group". After experiencing the construction of the East Coast and Otis, the wealth and connections that Du Lin possessed were enough to qualify for a consortium. His every move often means the future changes of an industry. He has become a chess player who can sit on the table, even though he is thin and can lift the chess piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and nodded. He leaned his legs and clasped his hands and fingers on the stable thigh. "I have considered a lot of answers to this question. But in the end, I feel that leaving these refugees in the empire is more valuable to the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Difficult...people?", can become a cabinet investigation team The leader of the team is definitely not the kind of "office worker" who only sits in the office and has no real power. The leader of the investigation team can enter the top 100 in the new party. He has a very important task to come to the west. So what he can learn, his vision and level are definitely not what ordinary government officials can have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those who can survive in the political core of the capital of the capital and have certain practical powers must not be underestimated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, your name for these people makes me feel a little strange, are they refugees?", when this sentence is thought and asked to export The head of the investigation team flashed in the mind, and his arm even trembled because he understood why Du Lin wanted to refer to these people with the title of refugees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, Mr. Otto!", when Doolin laughed, he couldn’t find anything that seemed dark on his face, always very Sunshine, he laughed and said Mr. Otto’s speculation. "You know, I have always been concerned about the empire and the empire’s international affairs. For the public opinion attack from the outside in the recent period, I think Very ridiculous. Although these people are illegal immigrants, they are also victims."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do they appear in the empire? Because their country makes them unable to survive. Those countries that are still in the midst of war make them feel no sense of security. They can die from war or tyranny anytime, anywhere. Therefore, they are willing to carry their bags and leave the place where they have lived for more than ten or decades, and come to the empire to seek the soil for survival. I believe that the Yaoxing Empire, as the world’s most powerful civilized country, should shoulder our corresponding responsibilities. These refugees should be taken in, and diplomatically given these shameless, ignorant countries that want to reverse black and white!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I say so, you are now Can you understand why they are in my eyes, are refugees in the eyes of the empire?", Du Lin took out a box of cigarettes and gestured, Mr. Otto’s buttocks slightly left the chair, and the smoke from Du Lin’s past I took one in the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of Dooling in the smoky sight is somewhat vague and distorted, Otto can’t believe what he saw and heard, because Du Lin’s statement is about to be solved. Gus has some troubles. Those illegal... No, the country where the refugees were born has been smashing the empire in diplomatic opinion. Some countries even intend to use this opportunity to extort the empire and demand that the empire give indemnities ranging from a few million to more than tens of millions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These despicable villain acts have caused the Magnus leaders to be troubled during this time, and the federation behind these countries is also contributing to the fight against those countries. The face of the empire on the diplomatic level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Du Lin’s statement quickly gave them the pressure to impose the shameless and despicable villains on the empire. Mr. Otto has already thought of the next series of plans, such as interviewing the refugees, letting them tell the whole world, what is happening in their country, what makes them run out even their families, even if they die The empire is not willing to go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will always be people who cooperate, the money is not good, and there are bullets! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reversal of public opinion coupled with pulling a batch of fights, the Empire will soon be able to reverse the trend and make a turnaround. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not that Magus is not smart enough. He, including everyone else, is bound by the times, and has not been able to shamelessly reverse black and white at the diplomatic level. Squinting and talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
