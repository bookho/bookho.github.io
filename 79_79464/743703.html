			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Doolin, it’s great to be able to see you again!", a young man in a suit and a smacked mouth revealing a big white tooth. Glittering in the morning golden morning light. He carried a briefcase in his hand, sitting on the opposite side of Doolin from the uninvited, took a few documents from the briefcase and placed it in front of Doolin, and introduced it with great sincerity. "Look, This is our latest product introduction, a great invention that can completely replace the traditional cleaning tools, just open the switch, you can clean it. Whether it is blocky or dust, it will be sucked by its strong suction. Go. You only need to periodically remove this garbage bag and put it on a new one!" The young man hooked his finger and asked for a glass of ice water, and continued to exaggerate the introduction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it’s a vacuum cleaner, a vacuum cleaner with twins as the power source. This young man is a salesman. This kind of career can be seen in Tener. Not enough, but it is almost flooding here. Since this young man who claimed to be Albert has seen Duoling sitting here every morning, he always harasses him and sells everything he can sell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Du Lin was not interested, he introduced several new items and eventually collapsed in Doolin’s silence. In the end, he had to frustrate the final publicity text. "This is a prospectus. Do you know the film that Irian is preparing for the holiday?" He saw Doolin nod and immediately changed. Rejuvenated, "This film will use the latest color imaging technology. When it is played, it is colored. Can you believe it? It is actually colored, but unfortunately, 16 cinemas in Irian City can only play. Black and white videos, so they plan to update the device."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The advent of color movies will definitely replace black and white movies, this is a trend, but the playback device is not It's cheap, so I have this prospectus. The cinema owners want to absorb some of the investment and replacement equipment from the society. If you are interested, you can try to invest. This is definitely the most worthwhile investment project!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin picked up his eyebrows. He thinks this prospectus may be more interesting than the sales of other products. He took the prospectus and put it on. In front of myself, "I will take the time to look at it. I would like to know if you can get a liquor license than this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irian will meet every day. A large number of tourists, local consumption levels and abilities are also very high, which makes every bar earned to spit out. This is definitely not an exaggeration. The laws of this state are different from the laws of the state of Kansas. Although the prohibition of alcohol is strictly enforced, they are allowed to produce and sell the liquor and liquor licenses. Highly alcohol, while specifying a quantity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liquor license and the permit are not the most expensive things in the city, but they are definitely the scarcest. Everyone knows that this is a fruit tree that can make gold apples. No one wants to sell them. Even if some people may need to use money urgently, they will only choose to mortgage, not sell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert laughed a few times. "Mr. Doolin, these things you said are not something I can reach, but I will try to help you." If you are interested in this prospectus, you know how to contact me!", he made a call gesture and shook, the emerging product of the phone has begun to spread inward along the east coast, many The middle-class families have installed telephones, although everyone is not very clear about what else to use in addition to showing off, but as long as the capable family has installed one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin had Albert’s call, he gave a slight click, and Albert excitedly drank a swig of ice water and then got up and said goodbye to leave, he would Continue to market his products. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a look at the prospectus and flipped it over. The owner of the theater hopes to absorb 200,000 funds for the update. Equipment, at the same time will take out 15% of the current 16 colleges and universities as the share of investors. Future earnings will be strictly distributed according to the proportion of shares, ensuring that all investors' investment is not a loss. Here is a list of the annual net profit of these theaters and the forecast of the profit generated by the next color film. In general, after watching this prospectus, there is only one thought in Du Lin’s mind, that is, absolutely making money, absolutely no loss. But is this the case? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the case, why does the theater itself not lend but want to absorb funds from society? Are they already lending, or are banks not willing to lend them? Or is there a problem with the IPO itself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Hall announced last month that it will fully build Ilyan’s film industry and develop an eighth administrative district around the industry. Du Lin had not considered this before, but now he can also consider it, for example, to participate in the tender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't drink the rest of the coffee, lost five dollars on the table, pressed the meal plate, he picked up the prospectus and the cap disappeared The envy of the buddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of life is life, the young man has lowered his head and pulled out the five dollars under the plate, playing a bullet, a crisp sound. Make him feel exceptionally pleasing to the ear. Simply packed up the desktop, took out four dollars and put it into the cash register, and started the day-to-day boring work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes of strolling, Doolin returned to where he lived. It was a manor built on a cliff by the sea, covering an area of ​​about 2,000 square meters, for which he spent three thousand. Buying this manor is not only used to live, but also an investment behavior. As the development of Ilyan's tourism industry is getting higher and higher, it will become the largest and most developed garden city on the East Coast. The mansion will naturally become the target of successful people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just arrived at the door, the maid opened the door, lying on the sofa, the face of the decadent Buddha and Airlis stood up immediately. In the past six months, they have rested in addition to rest, and they have to grow long when they don't do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin left the prospectus on the coffee table and sat on the separate sofa on the left side. He leaned his legs and pressed his hands on his legs. "The limelight has passed, so I gave myself and you have found something to do. I plan to invest in the theater. In addition, I have to participate in the bidding for the 8th district. You should go out and collect information. By the way, please contact the city of Irian. Guar, look at who is here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin never imagined that there would be no dark things in this clean and tidy city. Because these things are always clean and unclean, as long as there is enough profit, there must be people who are willing to take risks. Are the high-alcohols sold in those bars the wines from the regular channels? Not necessarily? Are the wines produced in the brewing workshops only available in the area of ​​Irian? Certainly impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be darkness with light, the more dazzling the light, the deeper the darkness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept flipping through the prospectus on his way back, and there is already a prediction that this is most likely a scam. He is very interested in this scam, he is the best in black and black! For half a year, they were rusting and long hair. He was not rusting and long hair. After spending so much time, he should come out to activities and play with the locals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, he contacted Albert and said that he was very interested in investing in the cinema, let him contact the owner of the theater if he felt If you are satisfied, you are willing to directly invest 200,000 yuan to directly participate in the stock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert got up on the phone and stood up, the spilled coffee drenched on his clothes and pants. He didn’t care a little bit. This is a big business. As a salesman, he can get a 5 percent commission, which is a regulation. Five percent, there are 10,000 pieces, and he has struggled in this city for three or five years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
