			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such a big thing, it’s definitely not the one who can cover it, including the compensation of almost 10 million stars, according to last year. In the case of the "Monetary Memorandum of Understanding between the two countries" signed by the Federation, the federal side needs to use 40 million federal shields as compensation, directly causing economic losses of more than 13 million stars, as for the capital market. The market value of the evaporated company is even more unclear. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not that the joint construction has a strong enough foundation and a financial report that everyone can see, I’m afraid it’s enough for the joint construction to go bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the joint construction workers also held an emergency meeting, all the company’s directors and shareholders must be present, which is related to the future fate of the joint construction. When the main major shareholders faced such a huge loss, they actually had a different kind of thought. In any case, the incident was in the empire. It was really impossible to do this business. After withdrawing the people on the empire. If you can rely on it, you can definitely reduce a large part of the loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all workers have deposits that allow them to come to the federal court, and the heavy cost will allow the families of many workers to choose the right things with the cooperation of the local government. Accepting a small amount of money to draw a full stop for this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the consequences of doing so are quite serious. As a society based on honesty and adherence to the spirit of the contract, if the joint construction workers really do this, It is highly probable that this will completely withdraw from the capital market and become a model of defeat. It is cast aside by people, so it is necessary to convene this meeting to decide the final choice of the way to survive this crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is active compensation and persistence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still taking the initiative to withdraw from the faceless shame? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than three in the afternoon, the spacious and bright meeting rooms are filled with the company’s shareholders and executives, and according to federal law, own a company’s shares more than A person or institution of 0.5 is a legitimate shareholder of the company and can attend the board of directors, but must abide by and follow the board's system to speak freely or not to speak freely. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the construction of the Imperial Otis City contract, the joint construction industry made a rapid leap forward in the federal stock market, and increased the share price by one percent in just six months. One hundred and seventy, the board of directors and professional market analysts believe that as long as they can complete the contract, the stock price will continue to rise. Their first order in the empire can serve as a gateway to the empire's closed capital market, allowing more federal capital to find a breakthrough into the imperial capital market, full of gold mines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, in the face of such an accident, from the moment the newspaper disclosed the news, the share price of the joint construction workers has already suffered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People are here, Chairman.", a long blond hair secretary bent down slightly, whispering in the chairman's ear, her white shirt It looks a little too small. When her age girl is developing, she often faces such a problem - the clothes are smaller, so she can't buckle the top three buttons on the shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chairman of the joint construction engineer is in his 60s, with silver-gray hair, his hands are ten fingers, and the elbows are placed on the armrests of the chair. . His gaze swept through the faces of these shareholders, and many people shunned his gaze with some guilty conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the last second of today’s suspension, our stock price has fallen by more than 47%, if we can’t resolve the accident within a week The impact, and the stock price back, Mr., many of you will face bankruptcy, including me!", his eyes are like a knife, the cold look makes many people I don't think it is very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people tore off the neckline and took off the jacket, the heating in the room made them feel too hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that many of you started secretly yesterday, and privately sold the stocks without the consent of the board of directors. I am very disappointed. I am Thinking that we should be partners, we are holding hands together to find friends who lead to the ladder of heaven, but the fact tells me that some of you are just shameless speculators." He picked up a document and left it on the table. "I have an up-to-date information sheet for your personal holdings. At present, Mr. and Ms. who hold less than 0.5% of the shares can leave. You are not here."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice fell for about three or four minutes, the first person stood up and said "sorry", then sorted out the clothes and turned away. Less than a third of the conference halls that were quickly filled were left. The faces of these people are also very difficult to see. The company has encountered such a big crisis. These people not only do not consider how to protect the interests of the company and their shareholders, but because they are afraid of shrinking property, the stocks are sold without the knowledge of the company’s board of directors. The snowball effect brought about by the behavior is definitely more serious than the damage caused by the accident itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chairman of the board let the sweet little secretary close the door of the conference room, and his face showed some smiles, a little bit shy and shrugged. "The situation is not too good." Worse, I just had a phone call with the mayor of Otis. They are willing to cooperate with us to fight down the negative effects of this incident, but for this we need to repair the railway for them free of charge. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting in the second position on the left hand side of the chairman's board, the old man who has been white-haired but has a good spine asks: "How much will we lose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his hands open, he answered this question with "sorry". "We will lose about 70 million federal shields. If there is any excess, it will not exceed too much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the conference room have taken a sigh of relief, 70 million federal shields, have been able to catch up with the tax of a relatively economically backward state for a year, this money is enough to make them stand on the brink of bankruptcy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chairman is very satisfied with his words and scares everyone. What he wants is such an effect. Of course, he can’t let these shareholders who are still insisting really lose all Confidence, then he will really go bankrupt, so he quickly went on to say: "But we will gain more than 100 million, or even 200 million or more profits! The mayor of Otis promises that as long as we complete the Otis The two railways in the city, he plans to build some railways, the total number of kilometers is not less than two thousand kilometers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharers once again took a breath and built The profits and added value of a 2,000-kilometer railway can definitely make up for the losses caused by this accident, and there is still plenty of room for profit. The faces of these shareholders suddenly showed a relaxed expression and a lot of smiles appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chairman nodded. "The first thing we have to solve now is to minimize the impact of this accident..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you do?", a 40-year-old middle-aged man who was sitting at the conference table asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chairman took the pen on the table and pointed at him and praised him: "Well, according to my understanding, the casualties caused by the collapse accident." At present, there are only 189 people known to have been killed. The local government is actively fighting to save more injured people from the disaster!" His eyes flashed with light, no doubt he lied, but he lied. This lie will have an empire to cooperate with him, then this is not a lie, it is a fact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the newspaper reported on the specific situation caused by the collapse of the city of Otis. It was originally heard that one or two thousand people died. So in the panic, all the stocks in the hands are sold, but now it is obvious that some people have been deceived and sold their stocks as mentioned in the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
