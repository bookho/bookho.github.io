			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Soro’s reasonable request, the officers of the Anti-Organization Crime Investigation Bureau have no reason to refuse. As a target of assassination, Soro is still dangerous. So far the gunmen have not confessed to Bangka, and Bangka can't get to the case immediately. He can still launch his men's attack on Soro while embracing freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you know Solo’s identity, Mr. Secretary can do it without knowing what is called cooperation and let the other party leave. However, after knowing the identity of Soro, in order to avoid the hot-skinned crystals falling into his own hands, he asked his subordinates to inform the police station and arranged for the police to come and escort them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that he’s not willing to let his own people, but now they’ve caught four of Bunca’s men, not only to slam the four gunmen, but Also, sweep a wave of Bangka’s site and see if you can force him to make some impulses, or find evidence related to these four people, and arrange things as far as possible on the head of Bangka. And arrange him as the behind-the-scenes ambassador to continue chasing along this line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this arrangement, Soro did not say anything, he soon realized that now is not here to argue something, he must first leave this dangerous Place, then figure out who wants to kill yourself and make reasonable arrangements. At this moment, nothing is more important than going back to the North faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, three police cars appeared outside the door of the Anti-Organization Crime Investigation Bureau, under the protection of several agents, Soro and Ornes The middle and the last police car. The reason why they were not placed in the same car was to protect the two special characters more effectively. If they were arranged in the same car, it means that they are only in addition to them and the driver. Can have an additional police officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of an attack, the lack of protection from the police officers is absolutely dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the arrangement is different in the two cars. In addition to the protected person and the driver, three additional police officers can be arranged so that they can be met. Provide the most reliable protection when attacking, and try to prevent them from harming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a rare thing. Soro has seen and knows a lot, and the big guys of the family or consortium travel the same. He plunged directly into the police car in the middle, and there was a policeman on the left and right, sandwiching him in the middle, which made him feel very safe, although a little crowded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police car quickly flashed the police light and left the gate of the Anti-Organization Crime Investigation Bureau, heading for the pier on the outskirts of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inland ships are generally not very docked. After all, the river is so wide and the depth is limited, but even this will not be built in the city circle. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ornes, who is sitting in the back of the car, is also not so comfortable. It’s not good to be squeezed by two policemen. These policemen are stinky. The smell makes him very annoying. He has been observing the surrounding environment. At this time, he has already left the city center. There are not so many neon lights on both sides of the street, and it becomes dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the scenery outside, thinking about who the attackers would be, who could hurt them in this extreme way, They have a deep hatred. Can Ernes ask himself so far, he and his boss, Soro, have not made such a resentment with someone who needs to end with hatred of death. Will it be... Solo’s nephews? This idea made Ernes himself shocked, and the relationship between the three heirs was not as friendly as they were. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every heir is always thinking about letting two other competing guys die, and letting them stand out from many family members who may become heirs I have paid too much, and now I am only one step away from success. It is also possible that this step is an abyss. To ensure that the next step is that heaven is not an abyss, the easiest way is to remove the abyss option from your choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo is blessed in this disaster, and the differences and contradictions between him and Du Lin have made Magus make concessions, once Soro can take this With regard to the operation rights of the SAR for import and export, with the power and channels of the singer consortium for so many years, they can definitely do their best. So as long as Solo succeeds, he is the one that is the most likely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think about it, it’s not impossible for the young masters to move some brains... No, not them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s their hands, then they don’t need to alarm Soro’s wife to know Soro’s whereabouts, and the whereabouts of Soro in the family are basically It is open. The other party needs to find Soro through temporary signing rights, so it must be an outsider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a figure in the mind of Ornes that slowly appeared. He thought that this guy must be Du Lin undoubtedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he took his eyes back from the already dark street, and suddenly he was covered, and the police car in front of him was very far away. Only the lights can be seen faintly. A sensation that cannot be described in words is filled with his body, and he begins to sweat, in this deep winter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more sweat, he took out his handkerchief while rubbing the sweat on his forehead and face, while staring at the police on both sides. At this time, the car body had a slight sway, the car turned, and the faint lights of the car in front were completely invisible. He hadn't had time to say anything. The policeman sitting in the front seat suddenly looked back at him and smiled and said to him: "Mr. Doolin asked me to say hello to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It really is him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, a bullet penetrated the head of Ornes, his body violently twitched twice, completely lost the movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Clean up the car, don't let people see the problem." The policeman of the previous command told me to take off the police cap and police uniform, directly under The car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Solo still doesn’t know what happened behind, everyone is silent and the atmosphere is serious, which makes Soro somewhat uncomfortable. He didn't really like the serious atmosphere of this solidification, but he didn't know what to say to adjust the atmosphere. He thought at this time, if Ornes is just fine, at least they can talk about something, so that the half-hour journey will not be spent in the boring bumps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly looked back at this time, the police car that should have been tightly attached to the back of the car disappeared, and suddenly he was guilty. With a goose bump, he swallowed and looked at the policeman nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police around me don’t seem to know what’s going on, they’re still looking ahead, Solo doesn’t know if he should say it, or is he still silent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is deceiving himself like a beggar at this time. He is very clear that the car behind him, that is, Ernes must have had an accident. I didn’t hear the impact of the crash just on the way. I didn’t hear the gunshots. Just in such a quiet atmosphere that people started to feel creepy, the Euros car disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that these police officers have problems! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed suddenly began to slow down, and Solo tightened his fist nervously. He was thinking about how he should survive once the other party showed his attempt to kill him. . But soon he was desperate, and the two policemen around him firmly restricted his actions. He could not leave the police car in the first place. And what if he left? Can he run the speed of the car? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the car slowly stopped, Solo’s heart slammed, and when he opened his mouth to say something, the police in the front seat turned around. The bullet of a black hole was aimed at his head. "Mr. Soro, Mr. Doolin specifically asked me to convey a sentence to you." He paused for a moment before he continued: "Everyone will pay for their actions." It may take a long time for this day to come, but it will never come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin said, 'I wish you a pleasant trip!'"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo couldn’t believe that he was so dead, and the other person did not care to use his bullets to penetrate his skull. He was lying in the back seat and twitching. He was dead according to the medical point of view, but his remaining consciousness was still struggling. He saw that he was dragged out of the car, threw it on the ground, and saw that the bastard who had shot his own bent down.... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who killed Solo is still good, or the gun in his hand is good. The bullet hit Solo's head, and there was only a small hole in the forehead. The fat and blocky brains blocked the muzzle and did not let the blood flow out. The hindbrain opened a window, and everything was sprayed from his hindbrain to the rear window of the police car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two police officers were actually very careful when he was dragged out, so that blood would not be contaminated by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunman took off all of Solo’s clothes, and the third car just came from a distance and stopped next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ornes" came out of the car, he looked at the gunman and put on the clothes of Soro, and took out some cosmetics to shine on Soro’s It looks like a simple change to your face. After a while, I didn't look at the indistinguishable "Ouennes" and "Solo" and got back on the car and headed towards their original destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At ten o'clock, under the protection of the police and witnessed by many ordinary people, "Solo" and "Orneus" purchased luxury class, On the ferry... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
