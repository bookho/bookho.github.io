			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One after another bad news continues to pass from outside to Mr. Todd here, the quiet atmosphere is like the biggest ridicule for him, according to the usual practice, at this time Some people come here to have dinner with him with gifts and fine wines. He will entertain them with delicious food, then talk about some easy topics and maintain his own team. Only by letting these people feel that following him is a future and a future can he truly control the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s already six o'clock, no one is coming, these people may never come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has called the people in several locations in Otis, and since Du Lin threatened him in this way, he would never sit here. do nothing. He had intended to let these people also do the work of Du Lin, but all the phones seem to have become empty at this moment. The busy tone that could never be answered made him realize that the danger was close, and he cursed Doolin while he let his wife clean up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you going?", his wife is 55 years old, but it is well maintained, and the "small milk dogs" are crazy. Let her look like only forty, less than fifty. The rich body and the temperament of the body are like a lady of a noble family. Her eyes are on her fingernails. Yesterday I just had a little milk dog to make new nails for him. It looks pretty good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she made a hundred and fifty nails this time, she thought it was worth it. It was a rare experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd opened the dark space behind the mural in the bedroom, took out some of the documents and two hundred denominations of the banknotes, and urged: "Of course There is a little accident. If you don't want to be unlucky, go check your belongings now, I will only leave you five minutes!", unconsciously, there is already some sweat on his forehead, just now There was a phone call to him, and his most effective assistant, the police chief, died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his office, his head was shot and his brain was sprayed, the murderer was a postman, the police station Looking for the trace of this person. In addition, they found that on the body of the police chief, more than 20 large denomination tokens were popular on the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that Du Lin’s hand is absolutely out. Todd does not doubt his judgment at all. He doubts whether Du Lin’s brain is a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked himself that he didn’t hurt anyone around Du Lin, even threatened it, but secretly cast some tokens. This is obviously a very small thing. The two of them are mayors, not the street gangs who can pull out their knives and break into each other's body for a hundred pieces. In order to do such a little bit of insignificant things, is it appropriate to start a killing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he won’t call to find out what he is going to do now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife slowly took off his pajamas, and the smooth body has gone a bit. After all, the ruthlessness of the years is the greatest in women. She changed a dress, Todd has packed up things, and walked anxiously, constantly urging, hurry up, hurry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you not the mayor? Who dares to do anything to you?", his wife is somewhat curious, since Count Lindes was killed by her husband. When she started in prison, she had never seen him panic like today. It is impossible for her to understand how the aristocrats who are afraid of death can measure how crazy a madman is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his wife had already worn a dress, he immediately grabbed his wife’s wrist and walked up the stairs. "Now, not when talking about these things, After we are safe, I will tell you more about it. Now the first thing we have to do is to protect ourselves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bodyguards have prepared for him A custom-made car, which is five times more material than other cars, and has more torque and power. Even an ordinary rifle can't wear the thick steel plate of the car - except the glass window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glass window is custom-made, but it will still split when it is hit continuously. Fortunately, the moving car wants to be hit by one part in a row, which is difficult. It is also one of his escape cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were four cars in front of the two, and he guarded him. When he and his wife came out from the door of the villa, they were immediately pushed by the bodyguards. The bulletproof car. The captain of the bodyguard responsible for the escort mission waved his arm and the entire team’s car was pulled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, suddenly a thunder came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the previous second, Todd’s heart wanted to look up at the sky. If it rains at this time, it is definitely a good thing for him. The performance of firearms on a rainy day will be affected to a certain extent, such as aiming. At the same time, the rain curtain will also become a natural barrier, giving him more opportunities to rush to Leeds before dawn. As soon as he arrived at the state government of Lizwa, when he arrived in Harry, Du Lin would have no choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, his bulletproof car slammed down and then jumped up. The roof of the entire bulletproof car was deeply sunken, with a broken hole and smoke. The driver of the bulletproof car pushed the door and fell out. There was blood in his ear and there was also in his nostrils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet did not hit him, but at the moment the bullet hit the roof of the bulletproof car, the huge vibration made him almost faint, dizzy, tinnitus and tinnitus The whole world is a ghost. He struggles to get up, but he will fall quickly as soon as his hands are off the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two bodyguards immediately pushed open the door of the bulletproof car, and Todd, who had the same black eyes and lost his sense of space, came out and ran him Go back to the villa. As for his wife..., he has followed the call of God and returned to heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kina in the canopy frowned, this is the best sniper location he could find, Todd’s villa is located in a bulge around the villa area On the other hand, his villa is about six meters higher than other villas. Keena can only find the tallest tree nearby and climb up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sniper is not very good, because the leaves on the canopy are too dense, and the branches near the edge of the canopy are too slim to withstand the tonnage of him. ". Just as he was preparing to send Mr. Todd directly to the world, a leaf swayed in the wind and blocked all his sight. After the leaves left, Mr. Todd had already entered the bulletproof car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they let them go, I am afraid that they will be run away, so Kea will directly kill Todd and prevent him from leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large piece of smoke in the canopy also exposed him to the sight of the bodyguards. He shot another shot before the other side reacted. The bullet broke. The first person's chest was then shot through the second person's thigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One shot, one death and one injury, superb shooting skills let the bodyguards who are going to "live catch" snipers hide in the bunker and keep moving towards Kina The location is blind. Many of these people are retired military personnel, and some of them are veterans who have participated in the Great Patriotic War. They realized that this was a heavy weapon for the first time, although they did not understand when the empire had heavy weapons that individuals could use, but did not hinder their understanding of the damage caused by such caliber weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing, if it is wiped, it will be hurt! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy on the floor who was torn in half from the chest is telling everyone what he has experienced, don’t show his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kina took a three-eyed squat and climbed down the tree. This weapon can only be used by him, especially after his modification, the power is even greater. . The last time the Buddha said that he had to shoot a shot, and Kea, who was a little bit stunned by the Buddha, gave him a try. The price is that the Buddha's shoulders are directly dislocated, and if it is not his body is very strong, it may cause more serious consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of gun is only available to those who are laughed by people like "half dragon people". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunfire in the villa area suddenly made the whole community quiet, and the windows that had been lit up not long ago had extinguished the light source, and the entire villa area Like a dead city, I can't find a little bit of anger... No, no, at least Todd's villa is still lit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ted’s wolf’s head squinted at the bodyguard captain who was close at hand. This bodyguard followed him for nine years and was a warrior. The veteran, he tied him to his side with a high salary of four hundred per week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can it be solved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguard captain’s expression was dignified and shifted from the outside to the Todd’s face, “Do you want me to tell the truth, or do you want me to tell lies?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when he said this, Todd The heart began to sink, and he asked with some fear: "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the bodyguard smiled and shook his head. They are all taken out, Mr. Todd, why do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it will not give him the opportunity to escape, the use of heavy weapons itself is a very troublesome Behavior, until now the Kansas Gendarmerie is still investigating the case of the use of extra-heavy weapons in hospitals. I can imagine that the other party dared to come out here, indicating that the other party is completely confident to leave them all here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Todd was silent, and the bodyguard captain looked very relaxed. He took off the pendant hanging on his chest and placed it on the table. "Mr. Todd, thank you very much for your care of me over the past nine years, which has made me and my comrades in war dead have A stable life. We may all die here today, so I have to say thank you first, otherwise I may not have the opportunity to say it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
