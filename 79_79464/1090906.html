			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawsuit between Doolin and the imperial central bank has touched many people’s hearts. Some people hope that the imperial central bank can win, and some hope that the imperial central bank will be unlucky. Regardless of everyone's thoughts, this lawsuit is hard to resolve, and it seems that Du Lin seems to have more advantages. As long as a lawyer can be seen by a lawyer, the average person will certainly not have this feeling. They do not have the professional qualities of a lawyer to find this kind of partiality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In court, such a non-criminal case with a certain influence and involving the imperial central bank is also jury. Although the judge cannot decide who is guilty and who is not guilty, However, they can influence the trend of the debate in their own way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s lawyer, on behalf of Adams, can say that the defendant’s lawyer’s protest is always ineffective, which would give the jury a feeling of panic. At the same time, the defense of the defendant’s lawyer did not say a few words that Adams objected to the protest. The judge also agreed with the protest and made the jury feel that the defendant’s party was always speechless. This effect may be silent, but it does exist, and most people's positions are beginning to favor Du Lin, the plaintiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After four consecutive court sessions, someone couldn’t sit still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interests of the imperial central bank are not only on behalf of the interests of the central bank itself, but also the interests of investors and shareholders, shareholders, and more silk connections. The interests of vested interests. Once the imperial central bank lost the lawsuit, in addition to the need to compensate Du Lin for a large loss, he also publicly apologized. This will damage the credibility of the imperial central bank and cause many people to face losses, so some people stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first person who came out was actually a member of the Ministry of Finance. He came to be a deputy minister, called Carol, as the first deputy minister of the Ministry of Finance. Second only to the Imperial Finance Minister. His main job is to manage the issuance of currency and to detect and regulate the exchange rate of the star in the international foreign exchange market. It is a very powerful position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two met in the manor of Doolin, which is relatively remote, not subject to too much outside interference, but also concealed enough to be a good thing to talk about. local. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two met and sat down separately, and Carol looked at Doolin’s study and praised a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study had not been changed since taking over from Doolin, and it still had its original appearance. The huge bookcase was full of books. These books are not like new books that some people deliberately purchase in order to show their cultural connotations. There is no reactionary trace. The books here have been read and read by several generations of masters, and have become somewhat obsolete. There are also many manuscripts and wire-bound books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who like to collect books and like to read, this is a huge treasure. In the past many years, the nobility has always monopolized the popularity of knowledge, and the civilian class cannot enjoy high-level education. The idea of ​​monopolizing the lower layers by means of monopoly knowledge is often a common means of aristocracy and feudal rule. The less the civilians understand the knowledge, the more ideological and stupid the mind is, and the greater the convenience of the nobles to ensure that there will be no Anyone who has a whimsy shouts out the bold remarks that "the Marquis of the Prime Minister is not born." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of a noble family is deep, and you can understand it in the study of their homeowners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Doolin likes reading!", Carol's second complimented Doolin, and now Dolin's message can be unknown to a few people? It is no accident that a farmer-born guy can walk this step. Every successful person will have the hard work and effort that others can't see. The so-called luck is nothing more than a sophistry of the leader and the stupid person who can't succeed. Carol’s second time did not dare to take a break from Du Lin. It would only make him lose his face. “I saw the book when I came in...” Du Lin turned back and glanced at the wire-bound book on the desk. "Reading is a good habit, and I like reading."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled. "You know, I didn't go to school, so I need to learn from other Adding knowledge, reading not only increases my knowledge, but also is very interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is indeed...", Carol is not on this topic. Going deeper, as he knows, going deeper will not only be embarrassing, but also provoke Du Lin to be angry. He changed the topic in time. "Mr. Du Lin, I noticed that you have many industries in the empire, as A businessman investor, what do you think about the current economic development of the empire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin slightly indulged for a moment and said, "The current economic development of the empire Very good, all walks of life are booming, I heard that there is something wrong with the South. . & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp serious labor shortage, this is the best performance "<br <br /> & nbsp />;Carol agreed with a long head and agreed. "You are right. After more than 20 years of rest, the empire is running again on the right path. We can say that we have achieved brilliant economic achievements in recent years. All of this has the efforts of each of our citizens, and the empire has the merits of maintaining a stable financial order. What do you think?" Du Lin nodded and approved this statement. Carol’s face had a lot of smiles, he said. The stability of the economic order is the foundation of a country's economic take-off. We have not done enough in this respect. There are always some reasons and changes that we cannot control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Of course, we have been working hard in this direction. From the beginning of the new era, the Ministry of Finance has been working hard to develop an economic and financial order within the empire. Of course, there is also a lot of help from the central bank. We provide policies and services to the central bank. Providing stable financial guarantees has driven the rapid development of today's economy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, I noticed that you personally and the central bank recently Some of the unpleasant things, the central bank has done very much in this regard, and similar things have happened several times. We have already negotiated with the central bank’s chairman at the internal communication meeting, they are willing to pay you a fee and privately Apologize to them for their reckless behavior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is true, the second president of Carol and the main board of the central bank council talked about this The matter cannot allow the three lawsuits to affect the economic development within the empire. Once the credibility of the central bank is damaged, it is likely that a financial turm will follow. In the current financial market of the empire, most of the capital operation itself is based on the credibility of the central bank. Once there is a problem in this area, it will lead to a series of huge losses, and even the economic achievements of the empire in recent years have been hit hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After several discussions, the Ministry of Finance finally decided to actively resolve the current differences and contradictions between Doolin and the imperial central bank to ensure that the central bank’s credibility will not be affected. damage. This is not selfish, and it is entirely based on the consideration of the state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at Carol’s second longest, and smiled into silence. It seems that Mr. Vick’s mouth is even tighter than Du Lin’s imagination. . He thought that the old man of the Wichi and the central bank would be angry with him. He didn't expect that he actually said nothing, so that he still thought that Du Lin did not loosen it? But this is not too okay, then why haven't they contacted themselves so far, but let Carol's second-generation convey the idea of ​​trying to solve the problem privately? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is not a strange thing. There are definitely differences and contradictions in places where people are there. The board of directors and the governors are not one heart. There are people who are not keen on power like Vicki, but more are keen on power. In the unknown meeting of the chairman of the board of directors, people have begun to impeach the current two executive directors, thinking that they are not capable of the current situation. Continue to control the direction of the imperial central bank, let their rotation end early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
