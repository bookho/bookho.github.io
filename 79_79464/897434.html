			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry gave a call to Du Lin on Monday morning and asked a question, "Is the vote on your side stand back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mid-term election is actually a cut-off. Just as the economists said, even if a pig becomes the prime minister, the economy will recover. This has nothing to do with the policy agenda and philosophy. It is a natural social phenomenon. Therefore, there is no accident in the mid-term election, Magus will inevitably be re-elected, and the new party will inevitably grasp the lifeline of this country in the next four years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this mean that the old party has been completely finished? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is not true. In any society in any era, there are always people who have stubborn and decadent ideas, especially the old parties who will run their own sites, and Brainwashing the residents on their own sites. They have developed a set of "advanced rules" that anyone can see and understand. These advanced rules are like a ladder to the upper class, as long as you can embark on the first floor of the ladder. It means that you may touch the edge of the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people prefer to use the rigid step-by-step promotion instead of the competition. If I do, then I will I got it, it was simple and rude, and I also won a lot of votes for the old party. In addition, the old party has been talking about some ideas of class restoration, and some pretentious middle and high-class people also like this statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, they are the pillars of society, the most important class of the empire, according to some people’s attitudes, they should be completely separated from the bottom of society, why Shangcheng District and Xiacheng District? People are reluctant to discuss these things, but the class has long penetrated into their bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are seven cities in the state, and two cities are still firmly controlled by the old party. Harry asks that apart from routine business, he does not want any The change. Although the addition of a city to the old party camp will not affect the position of his governor, his face in the party will not be very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no need to worry about this matter. I believe that the position of all the aliens and locals in the city of Otis will not be shaken. I can guarantee this!", The first beneficiaries of the development of the city are the indigenous people in the city. Everything they have has become valuable, and even their population has become a hidden wealth. In order to protect their own interests, these beneficiaries will definitely not shake their position and keep up with Du Lin's pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought that Harry had to hang up a few words after he had finished talking about it. He didn't expect Harry to say something that made Du Lin unprepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past, you also understood the situation in the city of Otis, the configuration of the city hall is not perfect, so the city of Otis did not set up two state legislators. Last state When the parliament was in session, someone raised this matter. Since the city of Otis has developed and the configuration of the city hall has been improved, the two state legislators should also be equipped. I have an idea here and would like to discuss it with you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every city must have two state legislators, which is an institutional issue for the empire and a necessary setting for the city to gain more benefits in the state legislature." . In addition to following the basic laws of the Empire, each state has a number of distinctive laws, and there is a very strange law in a state next to Cannes. Men who like to save some women who don't have life skills by trading money can't help the same woman more than twice a week. It also requires a harmonious family life, or it is illegal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, making such a law will definitely make some people lose their hair, and in almost all states, the state council is a competition for resources and policies. The place of state law. If a city is not in the state legislature, it will not be able to get the latest dynamic information, and there is no way to stand on the state level for the benefit of its own city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not opposed to the establishment of state legislators, but the problem is that Harry wants to be assigned. The so-called discussion is just a way of taking care of face. No matter how to discuss, Du Lin can't object to it except saying "you are good", but it is a little disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" Du Lin returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Harry recommended two people and said their resumes and qualifications. One is a member of the old party, which is also required by the system. The upcoming member of the council is called Hargerson. His grandfather is the Earl of the Empire. He is only 27 years old this year and has only participated in political work for five years. This is the benefit of “behind the people”. It may take two to thirty years for an ordinary person to mix in the position of a member of parliament, but a young person who has only participated in work for five years has already been mixed with a member. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not think much, after four years in Otis, he may be transferred to the mayor of a certain city, after all, there are people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is a member of the New Party, thirty-three years old, called Donald, who is also a nobleman, but a small aristocrat. With limited resources and a bit of human interaction behind him, his own ability is also good. At the age of thirty-three, he finally has the opportunity to become a member of parliament. Harry told Du Lin that Donald's father is now working in the Legal Interpretation Department of the Imperial Justice Department. It is a power-prone position, and maybe Du Lin can use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Judicial Interpretation Office is a very unpopular department whose role is to ask for help when someone is not familiar with imperial law. They can interpret the true content of imperial law and tell those who seek help. This position was also formulated by the empire in accordance with the position of the church. The interpretation of the doctrine in the church belongs to the referee, and it has been a notorious institution for some time. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the era of the unity of zheng, the church gave the referee great power in order to maintain the stability of the pope's regime. For all organizations and individuals that may threaten the church and the pope, they have used the "pagan" means to purify them. Of course, they also need to take care of their own face problems, so they set up this department to understand the doctrine. In a way, to make a charge of condemnation, and then obey the will of God, and send all the infidels and blasphemy to the stake. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire follows this system, and it seems that this department does not seem to have a too important position in the political system of the empire, but it is not entirely true. Misinterpreting the meaning of this kind of thing is not only the priests will do, the empire will do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most famous is the case of Prince Komoz’s rebellion, a case that made the judiciary unbearable, and sent the last non-Royal Prince of the Empire to the gallows. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said so much, nothing more than hope that Du Lin can use these two people. After all, in a city, the biggest is the mayor, Du Lin does not nod. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin certainly won’t sweep Haring’s, here is his territory, no matter who is in the crowd, but there is one thing to follow, that is Absolutely obedient. If you don't obey, then he can only kick these people out with a little unfriendly means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This event will be put together with the city of Otis, which is tomorrow. Tomorrow, the emperor will be listed in the city of Otis, and the special administrative region of Otis is perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Busy one night called Dufo and Kina, and Hite and others went to a restaurant to have a dinner together, Du Lin now has a new idea. If the fellowship only relies on Doolin's blood transfusion, it will definitely not be on the right track for a lifetime, so he needs to make some adjustments and arrange some industries for the fellowship, for example, the security company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a thought that Du Lin came back to after the return of Orodo. For the rich, they will definitely have their own bodyguards, but for For some ordinary people, or the middle class, the cost of hiring bodyguards is too high. People always have some irresistible dangers at certain times. If you hire a few bodyguards at this time, you can not only make yourself safe, but also don't need to spend too much money to support them. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Du Lin also realized that an organization wants to embark on the huge stage of the empire. It is no longer possible to rely on the current way of operation, and it is falling behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of a security company can not only manage the militarization of members of the association, but also apply for the gun from the empire, so there is no need to worry about the guns. Where, or from where to get weapons. It is not impossible to buy a little heavy fire weapon from them in the relationship between him and the deputy commander of the imperial court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now Otis is setting up a security company, Kea, you are responsible for this." Du Lin took his thoughts while eating something. Said it, but also named the name of Kea. During this time, Keelah has already gained the trust of Du Lin with his own behavior. When he first came to Otis, he also found two young ladies with skills. "Please" Keina studied the technology of Miss Sister. In the process he asked some things about Zijing Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks like a very casual chat, but Kina did not say a word, the whole process was smirking, the next day told this thing Du Lin . This is also the first step in his acquisition of Doolin’s trust. In addition, this time he went to Orodo and he did not hesitate to attack the soldiers in service. It also proved that he can obey the order. Wrong, Kea is a child who can be trusted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you can trust, you should find something for him. A capable person can stay in the hut every day, whether he is eating meat or sleeping. This is a waste of human resources. Coupled with the gossip that was circulating in the town, he said that he was a descendant of the Half Dragon, and that Layton only did his work. In short, Du Lin looked for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
