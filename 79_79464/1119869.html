			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has something to fear, these things have different expressions, but the fear itself is the same, for example, some people are afraid of sudden be quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin’s sudden silence made the air around him become awkward. His eyes fell on his own gifts, and a band of good-looking ribbons was wrapped. A hard shell book, or hardcover book. This book was bought after he left the villa at noon. He was not sure what gift to give to the royal princess. Magus had told him not to buy those expensive things, so he chose to go and finally decided to send it. a book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned a few laps from the bookstore and was not sure what book to buy. He also specifically asked the salesperson of the bookstore to send a book to a young girl. Best, then the other person recommended this book. He didn't even know that this book was an egg book - cooked eggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer casing is very hard, but after peeling off the outer casing, the inside is white and tender, trembling, slippery, and then peeling off the layer that everyone loves. After the substance, the egg yolk is left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egg, and yellow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book title of this book is "The Virgin of the Virgin". He did not read the content. The title of the book is read to give people endless delusions. This should be a compliment. Female reading, and very tragic, how could this be an egg book? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the young man with a strange look. The young man seemed to be aware of something. He smiled and bowed his hand to the fist. Stop your mouth and don't let yourself be too rude. Then after seven or eighty-nine seconds, he looked up and glanced at the book in Du Lin’s hand. "I have read this book and told the story of a female knight..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed an egg book, the female knight will never be a real knight, or the heroine is a real female knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people who like literary works are very similar to some people in the world of Doolin’s dreams. They like this kind of egg book with special identity, female knight. Listening to how interesting, the Cavaliers are the embodiment of justice and virtue. It’s exciting to think about it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this story is also true. After all, it was created by a literary master who wrote an egg book, inspired by an opera. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man introduced the contents of the book in a simple but not general way, and Du Lin suddenly felt that the book had become heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about it, maybe a joke will be circulated in the aristocratic circle of the emperor tomorrow. At the 16th birthday of the royal princess, Du Lin sent a very The egg book of the egg is given to the Princess of the Princess. This is exactly the scene of a large accident, and it is still the kind of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He skillfully tore off the ribbon on the book and threw it into the trash bin at the table. He was very grateful to thank the young man. If it wasn't for his sudden interjection, maybe he would become a new laughing stock tomorrow and send a 16-year-old girl an egg book, even though the girl can be said to be an adult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you very much, if it wasn't for you..." Dulin shrugged his shoulders. "I may need to go through a tormented time." I also introduced myself, "Du Lin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man took his hand, "Fast, a little man."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farst continued after the two released their hands. "I actually know you. Recently, public opinion is your message, such as the hero Du Lin, and you have to run for election. The governor’s news.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also an atmosphere created by Doolin, a hero governor, Hersman associates his heroic image with the governor , gave the public more basis for acceptance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone loves heroes, isn't a hero a more interesting chemical reaction? Although politicians understand that this is ridiculous, the people in the west like these contents and news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worship heroes and heroes as governors are a good news point, and with Doolin’s success, people always like him, and they don’t make people hate him. After all, the development of the western region has been well known in recent years. Du Lin relied on agriculture and animal husbandry to feed millions of families. The most amazing thing is that he has not yet gone bankrupt. This is enough to make people look forward to how he will toss in the west. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled very restrainedly. He pulled the coat collar of his coat with both hands and raised his eyebrows and said with a smile. "People are waiting to see me." Joke!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jokes?", Faust obviously has a different opinion, "Mr. Doolin..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can call me Du Lin, hey, we are all Young people, don't need those complicated processes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay.", for the good faith of Doolin, Faust readily accepted, "actually I Personally, you think that your chances of success are great. Compared with the South, which is more economical, and the North, which is focused on identity, the West is very suitable for you. Maybe you haven't understood it. The hero story in the West is the most. As for other places. On the contrary, there is a rare story of heroic characters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement made Du Lin somewhat surprised, and Fast continued to explain, "The desolateness of the West and some The mysterious background makes it more prone to heroic deeds, whether it is the omnipotent sheriff or the heroic thief full of justice, they are all active in the western context.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even today, you can still See some heroes in the Western movie, they only need one person, with a pistol, they can turn over the enemy of a train. Heroism is a very popular culture in the west, which is exactly in line with your current propaganda strategy, you have a Good team!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Du Lin didn’t know that there was such a thing. His understanding of the West was not thorough enough, mainly because there was no time. There is no energy to study the cultural color of the west, and he did not go deep into the western part of the west. Most of the time he stayed in the developed areas of the western part of the empire. The culture of these places is closer to the south of the empire, and the economy is the society. The mainstream, people don't talk about heroism, they only care about money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation with Fast made Dulin feel very happy. This young man is not the same as the older and noble, he will chat. I also know how to say something that Doolin likes to listen to. At least he will not be arrogant and think that Doolin is a farmer and he will not talk to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two chatted for a while and when Magus came over, they stopped and exchanged the contact information and ended the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know that young man?" Magus asked as he looked at the back of Fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head. "A friend who just met, a person who gets along very well, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
