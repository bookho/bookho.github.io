			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won again, sorry, gentlemen!", Walter smiled and took the chips on the table in his arms. He had won one night. However, although there are not many wins, winning money is better than losing money. Even if he won't win much, it will be enough to make him happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oak Bay Villa District is a magical place where the famous capitalists of the Empire live, and this is one of the biggest differences from the Federation. In the empire, economic figures are always chasing the political core, but in the federation, the capitalists are self-contained, which has in turn forced politics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Oak Bay is a very popular villa area in the Imperial City, in addition to the environment and all aspects of the facilities, there is a very important statement, then That is, "into Oak Bay, it is half the battle." The people who can afford the villas here are rich entrepreneurs. This is a perfect resource for many people. If you need to get to know all the people in the community, you will be able to find a way to get rich. The facts prove this more than once. Several lucky people have completed the initial accumulation and succeeded by such means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will make more people rush, smash their heads and want to buy the industry in Oak Bay, open the door to wealth. Not bad enough, the villas in this villa area have been sold out many years ago, and occasionally one or two to be transferred, they are also digested internally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are curious about the new family. As a social means for men, playing cards may be the fastest way to build friendships, especially if someone can win. When the money is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fifth day of living here, someone came to visit Walter and invited Walter to sit in his villa and chat. In essence, Walt refused, but he couldn’t stand the invitation of the other party. He went. In this gentleman's villa, he saw two people playing cards, some wanted to go, but the gentleman did not let him sit up and play, let him stay there for a while, and familiar with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing gets along a lot easier, the other person invites him to chat and brag to watch TV, or play in the yard. He will also invite the other person to sit down at his or her home, or hold a small barbecue party to invite more people to have fun together. Over time, everyone became a good friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until one day, the gentleman's hand was burnt when cooking food, just a participant in a hand needs to be convenient, someone needs to replace him to complete the game. Finally, Walter sat down at the table and continued his hand for the temporary left. In ten minutes, he found that these people were stupid, their skills were not very clever, and he easily won a lot of money. Of course, after the last lesson, he has promised to Natiya that he will not gamble again, and he has vowed that he will not violate his vows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, he always has some impulse to win money. He does not personally participate in the gambling, but stands behind a friend who knows Teach him how to play cards, which made him a very popular guy in this small circle. Many people let him guide them how to play cards, which makes him feel very fulfilled. Even if he can't touch the cards personally, he can only watch others win, but more or less will have a certain satisfaction and achievements. sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until one day, a person suddenly needs to leave for a period of time because of the company’s important things, in order to avoid the end of the game, with everyone’s persuasion and invitation, Walter re-sitting at the table and participating in the gambling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been winning, although he can only win tens of dollars each time, but he has been winning, and he can keep this in the worst case. This made him become confident that he couldn't say it. Everyone praised him. Everyone said that his cards played very well. The feeling of being recognized has always inspired him to look forward to the next hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the last time, he won more than 60 yuan, and then everyone wants to treat him. Since Natiya's business trip, he has won about two thousand dollars, and he has been willing to agree to everyone's request. Anyway, the money is on the sheep, and the generosity of others. He does not think this is a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group went to the most famous Red Light Street in Emperor, and found a nice bar. Drunk was drunk and drunk. When he got up the next day, he found himself lying on the bed in the hotel room, and there was a girl who seemed to be only about twenty years old and was sleeping. Their clothes were everywhere, and Walt even found a pair of women's underwear from his pillow. He suddenly woke up at this moment, a little overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that Walter is not really a bad guy, just a little stupid, and can't control himself very well. He was stunned at this time, and he was completely unclear what was happening. He sat down on the bed and squinted at his face. He felt sorry for his wife, sorry for his daughter, and sorry for his family. Soon the friends who drank together found him and told him that this is the practice of everyone gathering. This is normal. As long as no one says anything, who cares about these things? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire's ethos was originally quite open, especially after the feminist movement, the liberation of nature has become a new slogan, and in a certain ideology the whole society is in a weird "harmony." With the persuasion and comfort of his friends, gradually Walter began to adapt to such a leisurely life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three different games, I won a small amount of money, and then everyone sat together to drink and pick up a girl, and he was almost intoxicated. He almost forgot his identity and even felt that he had already integrated. In the upper class, perhaps the upper class is like this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another hand today. As before, Walt has been winning. He has been able to teach these players how to add more to the game. Many tricks, such as fraud and deception, let the other party mistakenly think that you have a big card and give up the cards in your hands, but these people will never learn. He looked at his face in front of himself with helplessness and began to shuffle and deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time there are some subtle differences, because there is a woman who joined the game. It is said that this young girl is a new neighbor and actively wants Into the relaxed life of Oak Bay, the organizers of the game brought her over and joined everyone's activities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how, Walter thinks this girl is a bit strange. She always looks at herself from time to time, and her eyes are very attractive and have a little adoration. Let him tickle. Any man who faces a half-faced admiration of a young and beautiful woman will always feel happy and Walter feels happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the four-hour hand is over, everyone should go for a break, except for girls, when the girl’s eyes are a little sad when she leaves, this unusual look will suddenly Let Walter change his mind and he wants to send the girl back. Everyone may feel something, and there is no embarrassment. He must attend the "Pink Night" activities of the boys together, and even some people encourage him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send the girl back to her home, the girl caught a kiss on Walter’s cheek and jumped into the door, he stood outside the door I touched the place where I was kissed. The heartbeat was very powerful. My hammer hammered his chest. There was a smile on his face. He rarely walked around the community with a little song, and suddenly found the world. It is so beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next two times a week became his happiest time, his relationship with the girl is getting better and better, the girl worships him and always wins I like his fun, and even think that the food he made is the best food in the world. Yes, Walter brought her back to her home and made a dinner. Her daughter was in the Royal College, and she was completely closed. She couldn’t leave without the holidays and leave. The whole villa was only him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
