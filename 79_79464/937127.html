			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cape family, including Fatima and more old veterans of the North, will have a group of characters like "think tanks". These characters are not They are given any official title, but some people call them "elders." Then there is the saying of the elders. In fact, all the nobles will not admit that there is such an organization in their own family. Anything that can affect and threaten the dominance of the family does not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These people can be called the elders of the family. They do have the obligation to provide their own wisdom, but it is impossible to form a group with a regular system and hierarchy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it is proposed that the cooperation with the Fatima family is the seven uncles of Soro. He believes that the "Otis effect" can be copied and has a very High success rate. People only saw the rapid rise of the city of Otis and the economic effects brought by the city of Otis, and subconsciously ignored the fact that the city of Otis did not have any pillar industries. Neither the casino nor other entertainment projects have a technical threshold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no technical threshold, it can be copied in the newly established SAR city, and the people in the city hall can be replaced by the people they support. It is their people, a profitable business like a business city like Otis is enough to make it impossible for several families to eat. However, simple and rude copying also has some predictable problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Innovation issues, authority issues, policy issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Innovation issues needless to say, the city of Otis is planned by Du Lin, and can also be foreseen before the departure of the city of Otis in Doolin, the city of Otis Some projects are constantly being enhanced and updated. They don't have talents in this area, they need to introduce training, they need time, maybe they can surpass Du Lin, and maybe they can never find someone who can surpass Du Lin. This means that they can only run behind Du Lin's ass in the new SAR, so they have only two choices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either find a better urban designer than Doolin, or get Doolin out of the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question, the authority issue, the ruler of a city is of course the mayor of the city hall, but the city they want should not be an official People decide what they do, what they don't manage, how much money they should pay each month, and what to do. They need a capable character as a leader to fight against the city hall. If it is possible to turn the mayor into a person of his own, then this is not important, but no one can guarantee that he will be able to influence the decision of Magus and let him leave the important position to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question, what if the new SAR Rigas and the new party executives want to experiment with more new things and refuse to directly copy the city of Otis? This is not without possible speculation. The city of Otis was a “test field” from Maggs. He asked Du Lin to try a lot of things here, such as prohibiting the existence of any monopoly, and banned workers’ unions. Excessive intervention in the city hall's planning of the city and many other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who are currently selected by Magus are very good, and Du Lin is very capable and willing to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unlikely event that Magus has a new idea, the new SAR is not allowed to operate casinos, and not allowed to operate those special goods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this requires a leader to stand up and talk to Maggs and talk to the new party, and the Fatima family is clearly the most suitable partner. The sacred woman holding the flame has not yet retired to the second line. Her influence in the nobility is definitely one of the best. Plus, Magus is one of the great aristocrats in the North, and has a deep friendship with the Fatima family. The female servant was able to convince Magus to shake him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, the old Cape family chose to let Soro come to the initial contact, and if the two sides did not have too much disagreement, they could start a comprehensive cooperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo and Fei Lijia said a lot, almost all of them said that Fei Lijia was listening. He didn’t think that he was a little thirsty, he remembered to let Ornes get some water for him. “So, on behalf of myself and my family, I’m asking you and Mr. Fatima to cooperate, this is for both of us. It is very beneficial. Everything brought about by the profits and effects of Otis can make some changes in the deadly northern environment. Although I don’t want to admit it, in some respects we are already behind the South. Now, this is a very A good opportunity will allow us to return to the position of the leader in certain areas. Please be sure to convey my opinion to Lord Fatima."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint The female lord is actually in this manor. This manor occupies the largest area of ​​the entire empire, except for the royal buildings. There are a total of nine buildings in front and behind, covering a vast area, huge like the royal palace! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Fatima lives in the last, the most luxurious building, and was once the residence of Prince Komos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Soro is not qualified to see Fatima, his identity is too humble, even though he is also a member of the Northern Territory, but he is not Confirmed as the heir to the next generation of the Cape family, second, he does not have any title, so he has no power to see the Duke, unless he can represent the entire Cape family and have the tokens given to him by the Cape family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The socialization of the nobility is so complex, and the strict class system and rules are the most powerful way for the nobility to consolidate its dominance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felika nodded. "I understand, I will convey to you my grandmother and your thoughts. My grandmother will be very happy. Right, Mr. Soro, have you been to Otis in person?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo even nodded, nodded and nodded, and Felicia asked Road: "Where is it fun, have you chatted with Doolin? What kind of person do you think he is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face of Felica Soro can only praise Du Lin in disbelief. "He is a very good young man. At least among the young people I have seen, only a few people like you can surpass him. He can be a civilian. The peak in the middle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for the city of Otis... I went to work last time, so I didn't stop, but I heard that many things are interesting. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Praise your opponent can also raise yourself, this is very clear, if Doolin is a waste Then lost to waste, he would not even waste do not like? If Doolin is the best of the empire, then he may be the second, so he really praises and praises Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo then got up and said goodbye, the purpose of his trip has been completed, and he did his best to analyze the cooperation between the Cape family and the Fatima family. He has tried his best, and as for the Lord's choice, it is not that he can control. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Soro left, Felicia returned to the last house to see the lord of the Virgin, and the virgin was sitting in steel in the armor as before. There is no padding on the chair, and the whole chair is black. She also has a white gold hair with an iron crown, which is the glory that the emperor rewarded her, and praised her for her outstanding contribution to guarding the northern realm of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Felicia came in, the lord of the saint closed her eyes again, and when she came in, the lord of the sacred woman slowly opened her eyes and the whole room was like A cold sword of a sharp sword was swept away, and several of the lower men lowered their heads, and a layer of goose bumps had been stunned on the skin exposed in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Virgin has suppressed a total of seven rebellions in his life, and an organization called Scarlet Dawn has been stabbing the nobility in the north, shouting "blood to open the dawn The slogan of the curtain, fighting for freedom, constantly inciting slaves and the rioters to riot. Every time a nobleman is assassinated, there will be a rebellion in a place led by the nobility. The most serious of these was the assassination of the two marquis, the entire county was chaotic, and more than 30,000 people participated in the rebellion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
