			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any party?" After the auction period, people moved to the backyard of the Grand Theatre, which was filled with some cold meals. The dishes, as well as more than a dozen chefs wearing high hats and white clothes, stood by the fire to cook dishes for the guests. Du Lin just took a sip of a glass of wine, and he heard someone asking him this question. He immediately turned around and smiled and shrugged his shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I didn't join any party, although I really want to do this." He laughed at himself and raised his hand and raised his toes. This guy touched the wine glass and took a bite of fruit wine. The sweet taste is hard to cover up the sourness of the fruit during the fermentation process. Even the very expensive high-grade fruit wine still can't avoid this problem very well, compared to his own. Snow Elves, this wine is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two put their arms down, and Du Lin continued: "I know that I am just a farmer. I can’t represent some people or a certain class, so I want to use my present. The situation, I am afraid that it will not reach the standard for the time being." This is not Du Lin’s deliberate misconduct for modesty, whether it is the old party that has been vilified by people, or the new party that has reformed political defects. In fact, the regime has never been from the nobles. "There is a drop in the hand." <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People only saw the "new party" smashing the rotten feudal imperial dynasty, but did not see what the first batch of new parties were. They are not the generals of the army, the celebrities who have great prestige in society, and some of the top richest people, as well as the emerging capitalists of the group, and even some "enlightened" nobles. Therefore, the regime has never flowed into the hands of civilians from the hands of the nobility. If it is more popular, it is that the regime has only moved from the hands of the old aristocrats to the hands of the new aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the rule of the country is still aristocratic, and the identity of a farmer like Du Lin is not eligible to join any party, even if the new party will not Want him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visitor smiled with a low head. He liked what Du Lin said, not because Du Lin said it was funny, but that he heard Du Lin’s self. A clear understanding of identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer is a farmer. Even if he has more wealth before he is licensed, he will not become a nobleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kicked the turf on the ground and said with a smile: "You are too modest, modesty is a virtue, but it can also be a hypocrisy." After he accepted the words, Du Lin did not speak. After a while, he looked at Du Lin. He officially said: "If I invite you to join the glory party of the Holy Empire, are you willing?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory party is the name of the old party, because most of the old party’s core figures and middle and high-level empire are the aristocrats of the empire in the past. They believe that the glory of the empire is now only on them, they are the future of the empire. After all, this country depends on them to control it. However, many civilian classes do not have this kind of thinking. In the eyes of ordinary people, this group of nobles is the cancer of the empire, so people call the old party members "corrupted bodies" and call the glory party "bad mud". . Of course, this is the thought of most people. When they speak up, they will still be called the "old party." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inviting Doolin to join the old party is not a decision made under hasty, Du Lin’s private liquor business is now doing a good job, from his night It is obvious that this guy is not short of money by being able to take huge sums of money to gain the goodwill of the big men. This just makes up for the gap left after Wood's death, and even in the "dedication" may be able to surpass Wood's contribution, which is very attractive to the big guys in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, to some extent the old party is a decaying stone that blocks the pace of imperial innovation, but within the control of the old party, people also No life is in the heat of life. This group of aristocrats is actually very good at wooing the citizens they ruled. This is also the experience and knowledge passed down by the nobles. In the past feudal imperial era, if an aristocrat is not good enough for the people in the territory, these people will secretly migrate, so if you want your own territory to be rich and have strong vitality, then you must let the people in the territory feel To the "care" of the nobility from them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a deeper level, what really affects people’s lives is not the power of the city, but the emerging capital. They controlled the seller's market through joint and monopolistic means to complete the initial capital accumulation of capital, and controlled the economic system of a city through “posts and salaries”. Then they sucked blood from the civilians like the lambs through oppression and exploitation, which led to a series of social problems. There was once a well-known celebrity who asked a question - why the harder people work, but they are getting poorer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question has triggered a brief social debate, and then people have returned to heavy work, and no other thoughts to consider how to solve this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This celebrity is quickly disappearing. Some people say that he has made a problem that he can’t solve even if he can’t solve it. Some people say that he was ruined. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is the capitalist a friend of the ruler? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously not, the ruling party hopes that the currency can be quickly circulated in various links, thus bringing huge tax revenues and allowing them to have enough funds to display themselves. Political concept. However, capitalists accumulate large amounts of money by pushing up prices and exploiting, resulting in the non-circulation of money. It can't be circulated quickly, and naturally it can't produce enough tax for a long time, but there is no shortage of capitalists in this world. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old party’s approach is much simpler than the new party’s various game rules for capitalists that restrict the development of capitalists. Since the capitalists rely on exploitation to absorb blood and strengthen themselves, it is better that the old party becomes the capitalist's "capitalist". They have formulated a new class blood-sucking rule, and the capitalist's accumulated wealth has been withdrawn from the "deposit". Develop and strengthen the city itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple and rude methods are sometimes more executive and implementable than complex operational rules, but the sequelae far outweigh the latter, capitalists We can only go back and forth through exploitation of blood, which becomes an infinite loop. The harder the work, the poorer the working people will be, the poorer the people will be, the richer the capitalists will be, the richer the capitalists will be, the more the old party will cut the capital of the capital, and the more powerful the capitalists will squeeze the civilian labor force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the authorities in the city of Trinell, who implemented the law of the bloody vampire, Doolin has already met the rules of being sucked by them, so invite him to join This is always a recurring game, it is an inevitable thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not think too long, and agreed to the request of the visitor. He didn’t even know who the visitor was and who he was. Man, but does not prevent him from accepting "goodwill" from the old party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visitor was very satisfied with Du Lin’s reaction. He raised his glass of wine and touched Du Lin. He raised his toes and sipped his face. “With you Conversation is a very happy thing. Tomorrow you can go to the 'Political Group Authority' of the City Hall for proof of party.” The power of the Delano Act has not subsided until today, and this is all that is full of politics. The highest achievement pursued by ambitional politicians and politicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to influence themselves to change the world, let some of their own words, certain views become the norm of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
