			<div id="content">Mr. Mark smiled and nodded. "Yes, what you said is very reasonable. I am telling the truth. I really have a little bit about this industry and the subsequent development." I don't understand, so I hope that we can cooperate and join hands to occupy a place in this emerging industry." Mr. Mark said very sincerely, there is no blackmail that businessmen should have, and this is Du Lin praised him. The reason is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who is sincerely interested in everyone, maybe someone dares to deceive him, use him, but when he represents the giant industry trust of the George family, No one dares to deceive him and use him. Either he gritted his teeth and refused him, or he was moved by him to become a collaborator in one of the George family's various industries, and maybe the kind of collaborator who could not make a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Mark’s frankness and his enthusiasm, including some of the good things he has shown, plus one of the things he has taught for many years. The affinity and temperament made him the most alternative and most powerful among the businessmen. He combines his strengths with the strengths of the family and produces a wonderful chemical reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Doolin’s confidence that he would dominate the industry, he might be able to be convinced by Mr. Mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at what Du Lin was not moving, Mr. Mark lowered his head and indulged for a moment. "Mr. Doolin, does your company accept investment?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not leave Mr. Mark’s dinner at noon, but Mr. Mark offered the idea of ​​eating something together, but Du Lin told him that there is no such thing in the city of Otis. When he was in the restaurant, he could only leave with regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr. Mark was full of regrets and with a trace of sadness, Doolin’s mouth was pumping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when they were chatting, Du Lin almost agreed to cooperate with Mr. Mark. He does not really want to cooperate with Mr. Mark, but wants to use the opportunity of cooperation to stage a commercial game of snake swallowing. In his view, the capital and capital means of this era are still somewhat immature. Most of them are based on the pressure of the people, or the money merchants, and the capital means of the world in the dream of Du Lin is a hundred thousand miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like the gap between a small class in kindergarten and a doctoral tutor at the best university! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Du Lin did, it didn't take long, and in two or three years it would be able to drain all of the George family's liquidity and let them generate debt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This method is still known when Du Lin used to watch Daxie in the dream and several other bosses come together to give people the next set. Opponents, then they registered a few leather bags companies, and carried out a certain degree of rendering operations, from the accounts and financial reports, it is a miracle, so that these leather bags companies seem to have great potential. So the other side came in, and then the company that was profitably profited caused huge losses because of two investment failures. As investors and shareholders, the guy could only fill in the money in his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money is actually "losing" to the company and account of a few of them, equal to putting the left hand of five dollars into the right hand, Then their opponents put five yuan into the right hand of Daxie, which is equivalent to five other parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the game has been played a few times, there will definitely be an illusion of profit during this period, they will come and smack, and directly drain the other company’s Liquidity, then cut off the upstream and downstream, and encourage the creditors to force the debt, that is, themselves, the birth of a tens of billions of bankruptcy liquidation across the company! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole process, I can’t see even a glimpse of the sword, I don’t rely on any political influence, I don’t use huge cost to operate, and I don’t use illegal means. . Everything is reasonable and legal. To blame, you can only blame the unlucky one for a terrible opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are more serious financial fraud cases, involving more than 300 billion US dollars! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this society, this era, everything is so low-end, Du Lin just wants to, can certainly play these people to collapse. But he doesn't think about it now. He is not sure if he is impressed by Mr. Mark's somewhat embarrassing quality, or for other reasons, perhaps considering his identity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thinks the biggest possibility is that he is already planning another financial game, so he has no time to reach out to the George family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if the other party insists on sending money, he will also smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Mr. Mark leave, Du Lin made a phone call to Orodor. The Buddha has not returned for some time. Although he knows that Buddha can handle his own affairs, it is inevitable that he will be a bit worried. In case the bastard needs help but is embarrassed to speak, isn't it going to be troublesome? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they left, Du Lin made an appointment with them to let them find a fixed phone in Ordo, or Tneel. He called this call. It took about half a minute for the phone to be picked up. The sound should be Kina, and he still seems to be chewing something in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boss? Is there something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin listened for a few seconds before asking: "How is your business doing? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other end of the phone, Kina took a greasy hand and grabbed the beef ribs, took a sip of the good posture and replied: "Things are done well." However, there are still a few minor problems that have not been dealt with now. The woman guessed that it was all done by Buddha, so they are a little bit tired now!" This is the only thing that can be found in his mind to describe the Buddha and the Buddha at this time. Vivienne’s word is greasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two adults are tired of being tired in front of him all day long, if not considering that they are friends, the woman is the lover of the Buddha, he has long been I used to slap in the palm of my hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, compared to the word greasy, he would like to use both men and women to describe both Buddha and Vivian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin squeezed the forehead. He and Keelah were a little unclear and asked, "What about Buddha?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Buddha? Going out, you may not be able to come back at night, you can call Vivienne's home, he may be there at night." He said a busy tone on the phone. Some strangely biased, hung up the phone and continued to fight the beef ribs in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had already planned to leave, they were already on the steam locomotive, and when they were in Orodo, they said they wanted to bid farewell to Vivienne. As a result, the next farewell became a farewell, and the two men’s itinerary was dragged down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two main things. The first thing is that Peter is dead. It is necessary for Mrs. Vivian, the wife of Peter, to be investigated. After all, Peter’s identity is no small matter, so this is a routine, and no one really thinks Vivienne. Dare to kill Peter. She is the daughter of the Governor, and the children born as political families are more aware of the political cruelty and the influence of political events than ordinary people, so no one thinks that Peter was killed by Vivienne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing is related to Vivienne himself. Although the Governor has already reported to the Kingdom of Heaven, he still left a pile of mess, for example, he is right. The way in which property is distributed. According to his legacy and will, Vivienne should get his old house, the former Governor's House and a bunch of messy jewels. But there was a disagreement in it. Her two brothers thought that the walls of the Governor’s House were hanging on the table, and even the carpets should be given to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the artwork in the remains of the elderly is for two sons, how to define this artwork refers to those listed in the Governor’s collection room, It is a trouble to include all the people in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, after all, Vivienne’s two brothers wanted to get more things, so they raised doubts. Before the Governor’s return to the embrace of God, the two guys were as frightened as they were, except that they shivered under the eaves. When the Governor of the Governor left the world, they suddenly trembled with prestige, and it was difficult for Vivienne to be in trouble. Therefore, there was no way for Buddha to leave immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time you need someone to protect what Vivienne and Vivienne deserve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things are as simple as this. I haven’t seen each other for more than a year, and the inexplicable misunderstanding has been lifted. It may be because of the child’s reasons, the two I slept together again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time no one can interfere with them, it must be a meteorite hitting the blue star, a natural toss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Vivian is also a very interesting person. She gave the rotisserie a lot of money and asked them to supply at least three whole beef ribs per day. Take it, this makes Keanan quietly staying on the side of the bones, not jumping out to bother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Dudu and Vivian were tired and returned home. Her two unhealthy brothers actually brought things to court. It was just a pile. scandal. But the two are her brothers, otherwise she wants to let the Buddhas kill them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
