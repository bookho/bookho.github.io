			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applause in the manor shocked Mr. John, who was in thought, and there was a slight change in his face... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Newspaper Alliance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing that he didn’t really like, but now it’s a life-saving straw, and he has a little sigh that he is really old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shortcomings of the George family, he knows very well that everything depends on the unique position of the feature society in the newspaper industry - if there is no special publication, many The newspapers could not get enough newspapers with eight editions. Therefore, newspapers in other places must make a reservation to the special publications, or buy a press release to fill in the blank pages of their pages. At the same time, in order to maximize the family's interests, Mr. John has established industry rules, and only "partners" can purchase the press release of the special publication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a partner? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s simple to say that the newspapers in which he holds shares are the real partners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such industry rules, the George family can become an industry monopolist, a huge trust enterprise. At the same time, this also allowed the bill passed today to lay the groundwork for the family, because this bill is obviously toward the George family. The George family controls the entire industry by holding the majority of the shares and sources of the newspaper, which inevitably violates the new bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Mr. John also realized that Mark’s way of cracking provided the George family with a perfect way to spend it, that is, the newspaper industry alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incorporate most of the newspaper’s funds to hold shares in the feature company and cross-share, so that they are not manipulated, from identity and They are equal in status to the George family and are shareholders of the special publications. There may be a big gap in the ratio of equity in this area, but no Imperial Law will support major shareholders and not support minority shareholders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately waved at the butler, and after sitting for a while, he felt that his legs had begun to numb, and he wanted to stand up with his own strength. Easy things. Without this call, he would move his legs and stand up slowly. His dignity and pride did not allow him to show such weakness and incompetence. However, in the face of a huge threat, this personal gain and loss has not been taken care of by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to set up the newspaper union before the dust settles, avoiding the new bill and causing a devastating blow to the George family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler held his arm and lifted him up. He took a few steps and lifted his palm to prevent the butler from continuing to support him. "We have no It’s time to push the wheelchair over.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the applause sounded again on the open space outside the building, Mark was somewhat excited to take off his coat and hang it. on the chair. This meeting was very successful. No, it should be said that Mark’s personal career and his more avant-garde ideas have been successful since he started his family business. He is also very popular with the presidents of these newspapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark just now, put forward a concept that has never been heard before, called sharing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is sharing?", he picked up his sleeves and it has entered October. The weather in the north is enough for people to wear two or three clothes. He only wore a shirt and picked up his sleeves. The steaming water on his body made him look hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is really hot, the heat of excitement, he has an illusion of returning to the classroom, is instilling his own ideas and knowledge, but this is not the classroom, sitting It is not a student. These people listen carefully and make him more excited and naturally hotter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sharing is sharing. The newspaper industry needs progress, needs development, and needs reform and innovation. Whether it is the traditional way or today's model, We all need to find something new. And the sharing I want to talk about is a brand new concept. I think this will be the first thing after the establishment of the newspaper industry. We want to build a high-speed and sound information network." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the east, "There is a robbery in the east now, we may need to know tomorrow or even the day after tomorrow. But joined the newspaper league and joined The sharing plan is different. In the first time, this news will appear on your desktop, providing enough attention for the evening paper. I know that you will be thinking about it. If I provide such news, I have it. What are the benefits?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what we need to discuss next, that is, the points system. According to the points earned by sharing, we will refer to the ratio & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp annual gross income distribution Newspaper Alliance of ...... "<br <br /> & nbsp />;Mark suddenly found that many people's eyes were transferred to him. He was saying that it was a bit uncomfortable to be interrupted in the head, but at the moment he turned his head, his hair was about to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father...pro?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. John waved his hand and he sat at Mark In the seat, "You continue to say that I am very interested in your ideas. If successful, this will bring changes to the whole world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sentence is not that John is talking about the scene. From the brief speech of Mark, he has already seen a different way of monopolizing the industry, a "monopoly" mode in which many people participate. This approach has the firewall that the George family needs, and it allows the George family to bury the true roots in deep soil, just like the tycoons of other industries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that if this set of points is able to make a trip, then the biggest benefit is the George family, because the George family has the widest coverage of the Empire and the largest number of participants. News network. Others may share some money, but the George family will get more and be safer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark converges on the shocked expression, and he finds the same shock from other people’s faces, which makes him lament Mr. John’s prestige in this line. There is also a home that is sure to implement one of its own ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just said that there is still no sentence, and someone interrupted him again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, not Mr. John, but a senior agent of the Imperial Police Investigation Bureau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two guys in black trench coats with sunglasses and domed hats appeared at the conference. The George family hired bodyguards to maintain order and protect the meeting behind them. One of them took sunglasses and hats while walking and showed their credentials. "I am very sorry, Mr. Mark... Mr. John, I am an empire. Senior Detective of the Police Investigation Bureau, Tom, this is my colleague, senior detective Jerry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Supreme Court of the Empire accepted 17 complaints, content It is the complaint that the George family controlled the newspaper industry illegally and obtained illegal profits. According to the first paragraphs 1 and 7 of the Anti-Industry Manipulation Act just passed today, the Supreme Court of the Empire believes that such a situation exists. I need Mr. John to cooperate with us for the investigation. In addition...", he looked at so many people at the scene. "I want to ask a question. Is your assembly reported to the City Hall?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the laws of the Empire, more than two hundred people who have no blood relationship and affiliation with each other gather together and need to report to the City Hall. This law was enacted for decades, initially to control the people who often attacked the nobility in droves. At that time, more than ten people gathered together, and they were reported to the Sheriff and examined and searched. Now the relevant content It was changed, but this law has not been cancelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always things that you don’t normally use, and you may not be able to use them for the rest of your life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today’s society, there are two hundred people, and two thousand people who are not related to blood or affiliation often gather together – the game. Every time the game was played by thousands of people, the organizers of the game did not see the game hall to declare such a large "assembly." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, there is no useless thing, just see if you can use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom looked at these people and showed a regrettable expression, "Who is the organizer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mark slammed the scalp and greeted the guy. "I, is there anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was no application for this assembly, the City Hall approved no "Tom's tone is not harsh, but the content is aggressive. Mark shook his head, and Tom continued. "That troubles you also take a trip with us. After the end of the inquiries at the City Hall, this will continue." He regained his head with his hat. On, there was a smile. "Please, Mr. John, Mr. Mark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I wait for the morning meeting and I will go to you again, or City Hall?” Mark added a tone. “This meeting is important to me, to my father and to the entire George family.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom did not give Mark the slightest Feeling, still smiled and said: "My work is also very important!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, your work is really important, but you will get the George family. Friendship!” Mr. John stood up with Mr. Guan Jia and walked into the senior Tom’s detective with a cane. “Is the friendship of the George family more important than your work?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
