			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus is a great person, whether or not he has some unknown purpose, even if all his actions are to maintain the orthodox aristocracy, But none of this can prevent him from becoming a great person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His retirement is not a pure external interference, but he offered it, and with retirement, there is also a program, this program has been In the constitution, he set an example by abolishing the prime minister's life-long system. In the future, there will be no more prime ministers who have been unable to handle government affairs and still hold power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he must be a great person. He restricted the power of the people and included the nobles in the scope of the attack. He is a real Politicians who stand at the national level are not hypocritical politicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, he still has to retire... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is indeed a little troublesome, but this road is chosen by Doolin himself, then he must go on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people have been together almost every second and second since Dolin and Ophelia have been engaged. For Ophelia, she feels that she is the world. The luckiest girl, because in addition to her, no one else can have a Prince Charming who belongs to himself and come out of the dream, and this is a prince who is loving and able to communicate with his own mind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days they have been helping others, pure help, do not require any return, which also allows Du Lin to experience the long-lost simple happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no impurity, no secrets and secrets that cannot be said. It is simple, but has too much happiness and happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin is really lucky, able to find such an almost perfect wife..." The reporter who just put down the camera couldn’t help but lick his belly. One sentence, looking at the distance is playing games with the children of the welfare home, the smile of the holy almost to shine Ophelia, other colleagues also nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marriage of Doolin and the Timamont family is definitely not a small thing in the empire, so a large group of reporters are following during the time after the engagement. These two news figures hope to find some point in their daily behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is a pity that the aristocratic life of the extravagant and wasteful life is not realistically present in real life. Instead, it allows people to see Ophelia as an angel and her passion for charity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She always appears in orphanages, welfare homes and the like, sending warmth to those who need help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t have the arrogance and squeakiness of the noble lady, even if she is faced with a wounded, wimpy wanderer, she can smile and deliver the necessities and Drugs, encourage each person with their own angelic smile, give them the courage to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are grateful for everything she has done, want to shake her hand or hug her, she will not avoid the hands of those people, no Mind if the clothes on them are dirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filthy children sang and danced around her, and she joined us on their own initiative. The laughter almost became these reporters. The sound of hearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some places have some remarks, some people think that Ophelia is the fate of Doolin, only Ophelia has a crystal A girl with a pure heart can pull Du Lin back to the right path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also let these reporters unexpectedly, although the daily reports on these two news figures are similar to what they did, they sent How many things to help others, but the public is willing to watch, but also like to see such a warm and over-reported report, and enjoy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there is also a small group of people who have an uncontrollable cry out of this - she is still a child! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister will come back to you next weekend, you have to eat well, and you have to study hard, do you know?", watching the dusk approaching, Ophelia And the tired children were sitting on the steps of the welfare home without any ruthlessness. The dust made her white veil stained with some dirt, but she didn't care about holding a few dirty hands that were clean and not too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little girl asked, "Why, is my sister going to other places in the next few days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;She will come over every other day for a few days, it will take a few days to see again, so that these children are a little sad and lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophelia shook her head. "No, I don't go anywhere, I am staying here on the emperor's side, but I have to go to school, only on weekends!" She touched the soft hair of the little girl. And she sorted out the clothes for her. "You must be good, you are the biggest, take care of your younger siblings, do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little girl As if at this moment was given a certain sacred mission, she nodded her head and said, "I know, we are a family, I will take care of them for my sister!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood on the side and looked at the girl, her expression was a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never thought that he was covered with blood and sinful hands, and one day he could bring more warmth to more people. . What's even more strange is that he doesn't object to doing this at all, and even enjoys it. In these children's innocent smiles, he realizes something that can warm people's hearts, called hope, also happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never thought that there would be such a pure personality in the world, until now he looked at Ophelia and believed that there were certain companies in the world. What the gods will swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He annihilated the smoke in his hand and walked behind Ophelia, and the children let the position open and let him sit down. For a long time, there was no such decent sitting on the steps, which was a rebellious act in the eyes of the nobility, but he was so happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brother, my sister is going to school, do you want to go to school?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin I touched the soft hair of the girl. "Oh, yeah, I am not going to school, I am going to work..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few hours, in the sunset Du Lin took Ophelia away from the setting sun, leaving only two long, long shadows, and some small eyes that were reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, after dinner, the two sit in the living room watching TV, and the new TV series is always so attractive. TV and TV dramas have been completely accepted by the whole society as a kind of entertainment that is not new but definitely an era. People are expecting new stories every night, even if they are nobles, they will watch the show together, occasionally. It will also be based on the guess of the future plot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
