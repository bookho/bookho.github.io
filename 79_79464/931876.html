			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can give these two members of the intelligence and intelligence outsiders who are lurking inside the empire a chance to re-select, they may not come out to eat, find a I saw the place where Mr. Lapuan’s house was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is no such opportunity in the world to allow people to re-select. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two were the intelligence agents and trained intelligence personnel sent to the empire by the federal government. In places where people could not see, the empire and the federal espionage war It’s getting hot, and every month, both sides will expose some intelligence personnel. These people are not recognized after death because of the special nature of their work. They are unknown heroes and sad warriors. Because they can never prove themselves with their medals, they can only be accompanied by shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, it may be their last mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A veteran, a newbie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newbie just felt a huge force as he passed over his arm and he began to shake his arms, but this seemingly honest young man was very energetic. Holding his wrist tightly, he felt that his wrist would be crushed. He was forced to be lifted and lost his focus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the first time he faced the veteran sitting, he reacted, he had just touched his pocket, a bench It was on his back. The veteran suddenly blushes, revealing a painful look, waiting for him to have any movements, several benches facing him is a mammoth. He can only hold his head on the table and deal with the unreasonable storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is an elite intelligence agent in the United States. He will drive and shoot, and he will be a good player in fighting. In addition, he will use the password telegram, which will use some common daily necessities to synthesize deadly toxins, and can also disguise as a target through short observation. But he has never learned such a street battle, an unreasonable battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The novice face has turned pale, he was lifted up by Ellis and smashed his belt directly to the other side of the wall, the huge impact made him whole It seems to be scattered, and after falling heavily on the ground, I have not had time to get up. A fine leather upper appears on the tip of his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His head was kicked a fierce sigh, his nose, tears and saliva splashed out, and Ellis stepped on his face and turned his pocket over. There are no pistols and anything other than two knives and some tools for...there are no things that can prove his identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veteran also succumbed to the ground, he found himself squatting on the bench with a more cheerful, so no image drilled under the table. He wants to fight back, but he does not have weapons. According to the code requirements of the intelligence personnel, he cannot carry weapons during non-combat, destruction, assassination and other tasks that require weapons. This is to avoid being searched by the evil imperial police. , exposed his identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table above his head was quickly opened, and a powerful fist hit his eyes. He was black and lost consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time the restaurant was lit up, the riots came very quickly and went very quickly. Ellis left twenty dollars to compensate for the loss of these tables and chairs. He warned the owner that if he dared to call the police, he would send him to see God. The store owner said that he was very helpless, but he also answered the request of Ellis. These losses add up to five yuan. It is a good thing to get 15 more. He would not be a silly alarm, and then let the police take the twenty pieces as "evidence". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group dragged two people out and stuffed them into the car. The car quickly sailed to the suburbs. There were a lot of inconvenient things and people in the city. In order to avoid trouble, they put the two guys down on the farm in the suburbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were tied to the chair by the rope, the huge lights illuminate everything in the warehouse, and even feel a heat wave on the top of the head Climb and climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your name!", under the stimulation of two buckets of cold cold water, both of them woke up, they glanced at the surrounding environment and finally closed their mouths. Do not say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are intelligence personnel, they are ready to be discovered and disposed of before they do the job, so even the most terrible death can not When they threaten their will, there is nothing that can make them compromise. After they die, the federation will give their families maximum help, which is definitely more than when they are alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellis grinned. "I like hard bones. It's more interesting to break a hard bone than to eat meat." He untied his belt, the belt head was pure steel, and it looked like a turtle. shell. He took the belt in his hand, chose it, and slammed it toward the guy who looked more calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately one pound of the belt head broke out with horrible lethality under the blessing of speed and strength, only to hear the uncomfortable gede, the vulgar With a trembling, his knees were broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you want to tell me your name now?", Ellis wielded the belt, but he was still silent, he did not care. "We have time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than an hour, the veteran was dying, he did not say a word, even bit his tongue . Of course, he is not trying to commit suicide, just to make his tongue swollen and severe pain. He uses this pain to fight the pain in other parts of the body, and at the same time can make himself speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a strong warrior, but the novice around him is already full of sweat, he can't stand such a place, such people and things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw this group of people proficient as if they had practiced many times, cut the legs of the old hands, and carefully avoided the thick blood vessels. Let him die soon if he bleeds. He also saw that the demon burned the horse's buttocks with a dozen letters on the chest of the veteran, and watched the people violently tear the blisters and press the straw and the ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides trembling and coma, the veteran did not yell once, but the more such a strong, the more the newbie feared. He knew that he could not do this, so he was also shaking and afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aellis gasped slightly, taking a pistol from behind and reaching the forehead of the veteran. The veteran suddenly showed his eyes relaxed and hopeful. He seemed to say, come, hit me.... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a respectable opponent. If I do anything else, it is a shame to you and a shame to myself. If you see God Tell him my name, my name is Ellis, you can ask him to let me go to hell." He said that he was from the heart, and he believed that he could not bear such torture. "Goodbye!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gunshot sounded as if there was an illusion echoing in the human heart. At the moment of the gunshot, it seemed to have heard the sigh of this person. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alliers let the veteran get out of the chair and stuff it into the straw, and send it to the pet food factory tomorrow. He turned to look at the novice, and the belt he had put down in his hand was picked up by him. "Can you, like your companion, die without saying a word?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Du Lin had no rest, the phone bell at his desk rang, and it was only after I connected that I knew that Ellis had called him. He had not asked what happened. There was a faint shot from the earpiece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boss, we found two spies stalking outside Mr. Lapuan’s residence, who said that they suspected that Mr. Lapuan was a spy sent by the Empire to the Federation. So come here to verify...", Ellis did not think that he actually caught two federal spies. If ordinary people found a spy or caught a spy, the empire would give a very generous reward. But he can't get the reward. "What do I do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the advantage and disadvantage of Ellis, he is very obedient to the order. Have the ability to execute, but lack of flexibility, some things that don't require brains, he can do very well, and some need to use his brains, he will continue to call Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue to check, according to the two spies, wait for their family to go out tomorrow, go in and see if there is a photo of Mr. Lapuan, or him Contact information such as friends and relatives, just find it and bring it out." As long as there are photos and contacts between friends and family, you can prove the authenticity of this Lapuan from other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Aliles quickly stole Mr. Lapuan’s photo and some phone numbers, and then sat on the city of Otis. train. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also on the morning of the day, a telephone call allowed the director of the Federal Police to act, and he shouted the sheriff in the rich area into the office. And let him close the door and pull down the blinds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the sheriff very seriously, and he was very pleased. "The Federal Intelligence Service just told us that the imperial person you found is most likely The spy, ask us to arrest him immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
