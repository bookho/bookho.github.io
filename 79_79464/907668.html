			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice is holding an interview notebook at this time, standing outside the city hall, the excitement of the body is shaking, there is a hint of urine that makes her very uncomfortable, she has been In the hard battle. Such an opportunity will only happen once in a decade or even decades. If she gets exclusive interviews and photos, she does not know how high her reputation will be. Maybe the special feature group who wants to take advantage of her cheap bastard will ask her to let her go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Alice’s first journalist’s job was in the George’s feature agency, which was her first job. When I first entered the feature magazine, I was shocked by the "greatness" of the feature society. It is hard to imagine that the entire empire and even other countries are using the press release of the special publication, and pay more or less for this. Especially after working for a while, she gradually discovered that the newspapers of the entire empire were almost monopolized by the George family, and she had a sense of superiority that she could not say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a reporter for the Feature Press, I feel happy and feel the unparalleled honor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon she faced a problem, how to stay in the feature agency. Every year, a large number of intern reporters write free press releases or shoot news photos for the special publications, but they can stay in the special publications as little as a mane on a cow, probably only a few. The huge competitive pressure and the pressure of being unemployed made her have to ask her "predecessors" who were looking for news. The seniors smiled and told her that as long as she was willing to let go of her dignity, the feature society would have her place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is meant by letting go of dignity is nothing more than maintaining a purely physical relationship with several heads of daily executives and administrative departments, not talking about feelings, not talking about money. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of the predecessors made Alice feel sick, and she went to find someone else, but the reality is so cruel. The journalists who receive the news award every year are proud to join the special feature, and the special publications only need the most outstanding ones in the journalist field. They never train young journalists who plunder the best resources of the entire journalist industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no more than enough level of Alice to enter the annual roaming list. If she doesn't give up something, why should she mix it into the special publication? Just because the press release she wrote can't be sold but has a pretty face? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she became an independent journalist, left the special feature and left the emperor. She once thought that her talents would soon be able to emerge in the journalist industry and become a star of tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her long work, she gradually realized that she wanted to be famous and wanted to be a leader. It is impossible to rely on her alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feature has the largest news resource library and relationship network of the entire empire, and the characters she can't interview, the special press reporter can interview. She can't get into the high-level meeting, and the reporters of the special publications can go in. There are very few things in this world that are difficult to live in, but they can hardly live with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, she has a delicate face that gives her a unique amount of money in the process, and occasionally meets some good people to let her interview, so she Only have a living space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you can't get, the more you want to prove that you can have it, but you don't care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, an unprecedented opportunity has come, right in front of her, as long as she can interview Du Lin, she will definitely be famous. Regardless of the identity of those people, why do you want to assassinate Doolin, the political influence of this assassination will be even more exciting than the usual reports. As long as people want to know more details, they will subscribe to her news, and her identity and status will rise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become a famous journalist, many people are no longer a problem for the difficulties, this is the most precious opportunity in her life, she must be firmly Hold fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her thoughts will be even more embarrassing when she thinks she will stand on the highest hall and accept the news awards that the big men have given her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the policeman who stopped her appeared, her attention immediately shifted and greeted him. "Is the Mayor willing to accept my interview?", She smiled and leaned forward slightly, revealing the Mariana Trench hidden in her body and throwing a wink. The young policeman like this has dealt with her more. This trick is best used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she saw the little policeman raise his arm and pointed at her and said to the people around him, "It’s her!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hasn't reacted yet. There are several people wearing dark clothes and sunglasses. She doesn't know what happened, but she knows what might happen if she doesn't go. Just as she turned and prepared to run, she had two black men standing behind her, forcing her to turn around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heite looked at her, and showed her handcuffs hanging on her waist, "Ms. Alice, you are suspected of assassinating the mayor of Otis Arrested..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "嗡", Alice’s brain is blank! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you want to catch that woman?", Dove simply wrapped the wound for Du Lin, and the bullet was found in Doolin's sleeve. Fortunately, this shot hit his arm. If it is hitting the body, I am afraid he can only lie down now. Even so, the bullet penetrated the arm of Doolin's arm and left a big break of twenty-five cents on the back, and the flesh and blood were turned over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These injuries need to go to the nano Lindes to be treated. Buck's bastard and Edward go out for almost a month, and there is no news at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin snorted, "This is a sudden assassination for us and everyone, but for the killer it is There are premeditated and planned tasks for a while. I don't believe in the coincidence of any unexpected incidents. So coincidentally, when I was assassinated, this reporter appeared on the scene, and now I have to interview me. So no matter Whether she is innocent, she grabbed her first, and after interrogation, she knew if she had sin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Hite came back, Du Lin turned his head and said, "I remember she had a follow-up, young people who took pictures of her, found him, they are a group."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon the news that Du Lin was assassinated spread out, and Harry frowned and walked around in the luxurious office. Indeed, Du Lin dismissed his face and made him embarrassed, and there was a gap between them, but Soro did too much. He can understand the idea of ​​Solo, and if it is impossible to complete, then the coercion is obviously the few choices left. However, Solo got it wrong. It is not the north, it is not their territory. They can find a way to cover up the big things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People will be curious about the forces that dare to start with a mayor. Some people who feel full of life will be able to trace the matter, even the card. The enemy of the Pei family will also take the initiative to expose this matter. When a vicious political event initiated by a noble consortium on ethnic minority representatives will surface, what should be done, how can it be dealt with, will it be tired of him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the empire does not deal with this assassination, it will make many people chill and the society may be turbulent. But dealing with this and related people, the Cape family and the hymn community will not be waiting for it, but also a storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is this idiot so stupid? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry slammed his feet and turned back to his desk to sit down and lifted the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day of the incident, when Du Lin had come out of the operating room to lie in bed, a gang called "Freedom Front" suddenly announced Responsible for this matter. They claimed that the assassination of Doolin was because Doolin firmly grasped the smuggling channels on the East Coast, monopolized the smuggling trade channels on the East Coast, and forced many gangs to profit from private liquor and smuggling to be dissolved, and some people were The assassination is also suspected to be related to Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation that was still turbulent seems to be clear at a glance, and Magus immediately asked the local army and navy to arrest the killers who dared to assassinate the important officials of the empire. You must know that Du Lin has hundreds of millions of money in his hand. If Du Lin is really dead, who are they going to cry? In addition, Magus appreciates the dagger that has smashed capital power in the city of Otis, so his anger is extremely fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Prime Minister’s cabinet has spoken, and this gang member called the “free front” has been arrested on the shore, with a total of less than 20 people. At the police station, in front of many journalists from home and abroad, they explained the reasons for the assassination of Doolin to the whole world, as well as the detailed assassination process, and admitted that the case was what they did, and Du Lin did not give them a living. They will not give Du Lin a way to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shocked case of the mayor’s assassination at home and abroad seems to be coming to an end, and the measures of the Cape family’s remedy are in place, so many people Think this is the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But some people think that this is just a smoke bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to be discharged..." When the doctor saw the room, Du Lin was changing his clothes and immediately stopped his actions. At least fifteen after the operation. It takes only a day to leave the hospital. This is not to completely heal the wounds of the wounded, nor to know the wounded situation anytime, anywhere, purely for the cost of a 30-day high-care intensive care unit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
