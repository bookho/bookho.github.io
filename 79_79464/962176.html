			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin originally planned to leave the next morning, but after such a thing, he must go to the Starlight brokerage company Loulu to show you the company. Changed the boss, but everything is no different from the previous one. He will not interfere with any day-to-day work, and is still in charge of Madur. He will stand up only when he needs to solve some problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, he also agreed to Rani. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I met Rani or on the official opening day of Otis, he and Rani had some small plans for taxation. Implementation will also increase the amount of tax revenue for the empire. Du Lin thought that Magus actually knew that there was a discussion about taxation between him and Rani. The two sides did not talk about it, and let Du Lin personally talk with Rani. In addition to Magnus, Magus needed to pretend. In addition to not paying much attention to Doolin, there is also a need for someone to stand on the front line for the reforms, but it is definitely not his own personal battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tax issue is the new tax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin talked about this idea, Rani screamed that this was a genius idea, and there is no doubt that more and more wealth in the empire is getting less and less. The people are mastered, these people are extravagant and squandering the wealth that ordinary people can hardly accumulate in their whole life. If there are no more restrictions on them, this will enter an infinite loop in a period of time - the rich squander the wealth manufacturing A group of new capitalists, these newly born capitalists and old capitalists are not much different, and even worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, these newly born capitalists will be divided into two situations. The first one is only inaccessible, the second is in and out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many fields, such as cobblers, tailors, and other prestigious craftsmen, who often exist in the form of families or mentoring, this money has entered their If they don't have to go out in their pockets, they will form a black hole in the money. These people are not like the big capitalists who started construction and construction of factories. They have created a large number of jobs and employed many workers. They don’t hire many workers, they don’t need to “reward” the society, and when the currency is getting smaller, people will I found that many things can't be bought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in purchasing power has caused the currency to be passively tightened. This situation will result in the products not being sold, and the people who want to buy will not have much money for shopping. Can put money in the imperial central bank. This kind of behavior severely inhibited the productivity of society and caused tremendous damage to the overall economic structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other new capitalists who have been created, they will continue to exploit the working class to save costs and sell their goods at a higher price. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, because of the passive inflation, the circulation of money has been blocked, and on the other hand, regional inflation has occurred because of the continuous rise of some prices. In the end, only the civilians will be unlucky, not the capitalists. So when Du Lin proposed to cut wool from these capitalists again, Rani immediately said that he could continue to follow Du Lin’s idea, perfect the luxury tax system, and then levy the entire society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are on a horse farm on the outskirts of the Imperial Capital. The northern nobles always call themselves elegant gentlemen. They like some gentlemen's sports. Playing polo is obviously one of them. Riding on the horses of Shen Jun, wielding a club like a weapon, and dismembering each other's front in the constant conflict to win, this is an activity that every noble gentleman likes very much. There is an elegant side and a brave side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s a pity that Du Lin won’t play polo. They sit in the sealed stands near the edge of the polo field. This weather is not suitable for gentlemen. Going to play polo, but the players they support don't need to consider these issues. Gambling, sometimes very elegant games, especially when the participants are nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have discussed several levies on luxury tax with some experts in research taxation. Now we have two plans!", Rani looked Du Lin, who listened carefully, looked around and whispered, "The first plan is to collect according to the price of 35 percent of the price of the item. No matter who comes out of the money, as long as we sell one piece, we will You must get this tax."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second option is two-way levy. We divide the luxury tax into two parts, the luxury tax and the enjoyment tax. The ratio is not less than 20% and is filled by both buyers and sellers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which plan do you think is better?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head after listening. "I am very sorry, Rani, to be precise, these two programs are very bad... Don’t look at me like this, I will tell you why. "Durin took a cup of hot coffee with a cup. He took two pieces of sugar from the sugar can and threw it in." All the plans. No matter what it is, there is currently no implementation plan, because you can't prove the trading behavior of a commodity, and you can't be sure of the price of a commodity transaction. Maybe they just give it?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rani nodded with a grin and he thought about it. He thought that the trouble was not big. At present, most of the big capitalists are nobles. These nobles, regardless of their current situation, will abide by the cultivation that the nobles should have. Honesty is one of them. If you can talk about the imperial parliamentary legislation, then this matter is completely okay, they will take the initiative to pay taxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he also wants to hear how Du Lin solves this trouble. Both the Empire and the Federation have the same troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and said a word, a strange word, "invoice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Invoice?", Madur recalled that there was no such strange word in the vocabulary he had contacted. He could not help but ask, "What is the invoice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin laughed, "Good things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus wants to turn Du Lin into a knife, and Du Lin also hopes Magus became a knife to completely destroy the "noble system." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Lani explained in detail the benefits of the "invoice" and the meaning in practice, Rani’s eyes are rounded, no Question Once the invoice is passed on the Imperial Parliament, the first thing to be hit is the old party camp. This group of nobles intercepted the tax through various means and became the nourishment of the old party. This is also the tax drawback that the New Party has always wanted to eradicate. The problem is that the old parties are very "dedication" in this respect. They are always able to make the books very good, and they will be free for their own sites. Capitalists make false accounts, which may result in a city's annual tax revenue of more than 100,000 and hundreds of thousands. Occasionally, some cities have two or three million, which may be an accident. But if you have the invoice, you can't stop the old party's behavior, you can also slap on their important source of political funds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point Rani first considered the use of invoices for political struggles, and then the benefits of universal access to all aspects of society. The capitalist’s income has become a bit more transparent. At the same time, it can also return part of the funds to the bottom of society through invoice subsidy, expand the support rate of the underlying citizens to the new party, and at the same time enable people to buy goods in this way. Ask for an invoice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the suggestion made by Du Lin. According to the invoice or the sales voucher or the purchase voucher, no matter what the purchase type, the tax collection point and the amount of the amount, the price is one tenth to five percent. subsidy. It seems that this is not a huge number. After all, the basic point is small, and you need to pay attention to it. Consumption has inertia and continuity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a family spends 25 yuan a month on the purchase of necessities, such as food, they can get a 5 percent subsidy. . Four months is ten dollars, and one year is thirty, which is equivalent to one month's salary. This may not be a big sum for an ordinary family, but it is a money that cannot be given up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will develop the habit of asking for invoices. As for the big capitalists, the amount on the invoice is tax deductible to a certain extent, so that they can take the initiative to ask for invoices. Once this mechanism can be successfully implemented, it will bring huge benefits and improvements to taxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raniman’s mind is a follow-up idea. He thinks chatting with Du Lin is a very meaningful thing, because the ideas he provides are always given to him. Too much inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After chatting for a while, Rani couldn’t sit still, the new year started, and there was a lot of new work to do next week. There is the first imperial council of the year, and he needs to sort out a few things to submit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After inviting Rani to have a chance to play in Otis, Du Lin left the Imperial City by car. His time in Otis may not be very good. More, up to this year will be transferred. On the one hand, he provided the New Party with a lot of "ammunition" to attack the capital forces that have now penetrated the imperial empire in all aspects, and also attacked the old party. He has accomplished his task as a sharp knife, and then it is time for him to return to the scabbard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been psychologically prepared for this, and his recent limelight is a bit too big, whether Magus is to protect him or to press Pressing him will remove him from the city of Otis as an "exercise" for him, which is his chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now has a lot of money in his hands, which is more important than money as an important capital that he appears in front of people in another image. For a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
