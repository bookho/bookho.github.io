			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Donald has already called you several times, I hope you can call him back when you come back." Du Lin just arrived at the villa, and Dove asked him. Unload the coat and tell him what happened after he left. I don't know if Dev has served as the mayor's secretary for a period of time and has experienced personal experience, or she has already sniffed some special flavors. This time, Du Lin chose to come to the west, and she also followed directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and greeted everyone and then got into the study. Now he has an unparalleled amount of huge liquidity in his hands. As long as he thinks, he can form a medium-sized consortium anytime, anywhere. But his future is not commercial, so the money will not be used elsewhere. When he arrived in the West, he bought a larger villa in the main cities to house the people who followed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the study, picking up the towel and rubbing the invisible dust on the hand, brought a glass of wine with him, and sat in the chair to call Donald . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you have something to say to me?" When the phone was connected, Du Lin made the words clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other Donald’s phone snorted. “Yes, I think we should talk about the city of Otis before things change. Something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can say, I am listening!", Du Lin took a sip of wine, this is not a product produced by Irian, is The local agent took the wine from the authorized party, but there is not much circulation in the wine. The added water is not much. It is the second puree. In addition, some spices are added to keep the wine with a light fragrance. Drink it. Not so monotonous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald organized the language. He called Du Lin to talk to Du Lin and he had a great deal of courage. After all, Du Lin tossed him in this period of time, he is the real victim, but he must stand in a wrong position and communicate with Doolin, which makes him very uncomfortable, and indignant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, he said: "Du Lin, we have been working together for a while, and each other should know very well, you know what I am. People, I also know who you are. Let this farce stop here! It will not be of any benefit to me to continue to it. This is a thing that should not happen. No matter what kind of problem, The first thing we should do is communicate, not fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now the city of Otis is facing huge problems. If it can't solve the continuous impact after the spring, I believe this is something we don't want to see. Now it's still too late, we can negotiate between us. Disagreement, what do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald feels very sincere in his words, his tone is already in full swing, and even can be said to be begging for Du Lin to end All the previous things, he will not do anything, and he is willing to make a certain degree of compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father told him the solution. He thought more deeply and thought about it. In fact, he could not solve his current situation perfectly. He himself was a nobleman. He knows more about the demanding power and interests of the big capitalists from these nobles. Once he has taken over the Cape family, his power will be reduced to a level that can only “maintain” his mayor’s identity. All future things that exceed their authority must be discussed with the Cape family. Will become a beggar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you follow this line of thought, it is obviously more appropriate to reach a compromise with Du Lin than to maintain his status by relying on the Cape family. He knows what kind of person Du Lin is. As long as he does not violate his rules, he will not have any words even if he flies to heaven, and he will use more freedom than relying on the Cape family and the hymn community. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he had the last hope, begged Doolin for his forgiveness, and then sat down to handle the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin asked the wine glass in his hand and asked, "What else do you want to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This sentence obviously erased the efforts of Donald’s words just now, which made Donald’s anger somewhat uncontrollable. “Du Lin, I know that you are very powerful, but you have to understand. In this empire, It’s not just you alone, there are so many people who can make you powerless. I’m just trying my best to resolve this matter peacefully, if we can’t agree...”, the sound in the earpiece suddenly Cut off for a moment, "There is a positive war, I will not necessarily lose, you will not necessarily win!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin put the cup in his hand On the table, sit up a little. "If you want to tell me only these, I can only tell you clearly, then let's fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Mayor Donald, you only have two ways to go, apologize, and then get out of my city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or by me to defeat all your persistence and pride , take you out of my city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have no other choices, please remember, no one can force me to do what I don't want to do Nothing can happen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hang of the phone makes the other Donald of the phone feel a violent stomachache in anger, he Du Lin is not mad, he has compromised, Du Lin is still aggressive! As long as he voluntarily resigns, he will not have any further room in politics later. Politics is a very cruel circle. It is not a film and television circle. If you fail a movie, you can come again. It is not a sports circle. The alternation of failure and victory is a common thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, as long as you fail once, those around you who are in the same position and keep climbing up will take you as a stepping stone and keep stepping on you to higher The place to climb, there is no room for resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his own future, in order to be able to reinvigorate the glory of the family, Donald can only choose to rely on the Cape family after Doolin refused to compromise. He has to struggle, even if he lost, at least he tried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked the secretary to get some wine for him, took some painkillers and took a deep breath, feeling better, only when the phone was dialed The phone of the Cappe family, he had to talk to the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after Solo’s failure, the Cape family almost extinguished the idea of ​​continuing to fight for interests in Otis, and Du Lin’s cross-shareholding It is by far the most complicated and most involved shareholding plan. If you want to win a casino, at least you have to convince dozens of shareholders to get the majority of the casino's shares. If you want to completely own a casino share, you must convince 140 shareholders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is a fool, using a few years of profit to buy a stake that will continue to generate profits, or even as a "heirloom", only the mentally handicapped will . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I didn’t expect that there was a huge contradiction between the new mayor of Otis, Donald and Doolin, which made some old people in the Cape family. Think this might be a rejuvenation when they controlled the casino. With the cooperation of Donald and the intimidation of their Cape family and sacred consortium, there will be people who are afraid of death to hand over their equity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was at this time that Donald’s call had turned his attention to the sight of the Fatima family’s joint open export SAR and pulled back into the hinterland of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the great Prime Minister of the Empire, Magus, is also concerned about this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is receiving his good friend Barr in his own study. The two have known each other for decades, and the relationship is very good, almost to the point where there is nothing to say. . Of course, with the big guys like Magus, there is nothing to say, and Bar has a certain status. After talking about some other things, the two quickly turned to the recent events in the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internal party investigation team of the New Party has not started the investigation procedure for Donald. It is Maggs who has raised his hand and blocked it. Now it is not suitable for moving the knife. When the dishes are served, it is the best time to move the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't think that the young man of Doolin could have such terrible mobility. His wisdom and his ability should not appear on a farmer's son. Such a good young man may be able to recruit us, I heard that you have a granddaughter?", Barr chewed the beef jerky while shaking his legs. If there are other nobles who will be scared in the room, the two great men of the empire have no aristocratic appearance at all, and they are like civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus turned a blank eye. "My granddaughter is only nine years old this year, and I am not going to make up for Dulin’s final shortcoming. You also admitted. His terrible, if he gives him a bigger stage, no one knows what he will do to make people shocked!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar touched his own Burst, use your fingertips to go backwards. "I really appreciate him. You can ask, he would like to come in. My granddaughter is just six years old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are playing with fire, understand?", Magus also picked up a dried beef jerky and stuffed it into his mouth. "He didn't have anything to put Donald." And the old Kape brushed the group, if you gave him more things, then the group that he played may be your own."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His The ambition is too big. The empire now needs not the ambitious family. What is needed is to restore the strength of the empire as soon as possible. It seems that the possibility of war will occur in the future. Great, but did you notice that, in addition to our other places in the frequent outbreak of the war, after all the world is not safe "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
