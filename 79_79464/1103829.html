This will make them more profitable and less risky. When they are too risky in a certain trade, they can reduce the risk to a minimum through monetary policy and foreign policy. In particular, when the power of these consortia can be mobilized to build the national family and even the federal government, the whole world is their gold mine, and their wealth and power will continue to expand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplest example, when they fail because of a big investment, a large investment that may involve hundreds of millions of billions, The series of means interferes with the exchange rate of the Federal Shield and minimizes losses. If you are paying a country or a big force of 1 billion federal shields according to the contract, these have already signed contracts. But at this time, the federal shield plunged in the exchange rate market, which may be 10% or 20%, which means that they pay less true value when the amount of compensation is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, to do this, they must unite and take the federal power from the hands of the nation-building, who have a stronger desire for profit. Free neutral capitalist control can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is a very critical period. They are not only exporting economic rules, selling goods to gain benefits, but also expanding their influence and silently accumulating. Power, after the end of things, and then fight with the founding of the national family. In such a special period, no accidents are allowed. As long as Doolin makes things that are detrimental to their interests, they will join forces to kick Du Lin out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if he just wants to take advantage of this opportunity to make a fortune here, they don’t mind Du Linshun with a little oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youngest consortium leader went to the floor window to look at this bustling city, his thoughts drifting very far, like in the sky Clouds are as elusive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the busy street, Mr. Williams took his family out of a shopping mall. He brought a pair of very beautiful sunglasses, and his gray-white bear coat made his whole person look like a swell, just like It is his best performance at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steady capture of the second round of the market made him make a lot of money, a big pen! He has returned the bank's loan and took the house back. The loan shark has also returned to the loan, and there are now more than 700,000 federal shields in the bank. Betty's cute young man told him that he hadn't heard of any big market recently, so he took advantage of this time of leisure and started shopping with his family. After all, it was already at the end of November, not far from the New Year. And he hasn't had such a happy shopping with his family for a long time. As a husband, a father, this is what he needs to do most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter in the shopping center pushed the shopping cart full of goods parked on the side of the road, neatly placed the shopping bags stacked on top of Williams In the trunk of Mr. Car, when he received 20 tips from Mr. Williams, he was only envious, and he was left with nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of the rich is really colorful, you can describe the customer’s shopping journey by buying and buying, they don’t consider the price and other factors at all. As long as they think it is appropriate and like it, they will pay for it. A girl once reminded the gentleman about a tie clip, the price may be a bit high, not as good as the other one, and the price is more appropriate. The kind reminder was humiliated by Mr. Williams. He not only angered the girl on the spot, but also asked the manager to explain whether the mall looked down on people like him and actually let the guide arrange him to buy cheap bargains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some of my heart is not happy, but this is rich people, this is the life of rich people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a family eat a meal at the best restaurant in the city, Williams looks at his family with happiness and satisfaction, signing with pleasure A cash check was handed to the waiter at the restaurant, and he looked at the wife and the children's eyes. He was very satisfied. This is the treatment that a true family owner should enjoy. Everyone worships him, trusts him, and believes in him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, dear, and the children, we should go back. After a while, we will come out again and send it as good as today.", After leaving the restaurant, sitting in the car, Williams still does not forget to teach. "But there is a condition, that is, I hope to see you get A or A+ comments in the final test of this semester. I will give you You have a huge surprise, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cheers of the children in the back seat made him and his wife smile on their faces. His wife looked back at the children who were in the carnival and shook their heads. "Dear, you should not promise these things. They may turn their motivation for learning from interest into a pursuit, which is contrary to the original intention of education."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams shrugged shoulders "Who cares? No matter what they are learning, as long as they have a good grade, they should get what they need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Dad, You are right!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom, please don't say it again, let us be happy for a while?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning home, the two children were tired after a day of play. After finishing the wash, they went back to the room to sleep, leaving only Mr. Williams and his wife to watch the latest tape from the Empire in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that the recent financial market's positives are actually some people's conspiracy. I am worried about this. Maybe you should consider reopening the factory, maybe There are other turning points. The newspaper also said that after the export trade will increase subsidies and tax rebates, I always have some concerns." The recent news in the newspapers has been reporting the crazy financial market is a small conspiracy. It’s just that these reports... didn’t make much difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may have played a certain role in the beginning, allowing some blind investors to close their funds and start to wait and see, but in a missed market, these Graduation has gradually become a kind of sensationalism, but it has been abandoned by people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Williams shook his head indifferently, "Dear, don't believe in the reports of the tabloids, the federal finances will only get better and better, along with The substantial increase in export trade and our external economic assistance have made the Federal Shield more recognized by the country, and there will be a long room for growth in the next five to ten years.” Mr. Williams said the head is this. During the period, he used a good time without "internal news" to read a few books and supplemented some financial knowledge. He felt that he could be regarded as a half expert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you don't know? The conspiracy of some despicable foreigners has gone bankrupt, we are invincible, when the interests of all federal people are the same No one can beat us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for the factory...", he thought for a while. "Wait, if the policy really improves, I will let the factory work again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop down The factory once caused him a very headache. In the federation, there was also an organization like the Workers’ Union. They found Mr. Williams and hoped that he could give an explanation to the workers he hired. After he paid 30,000 yuan, he solved the problem, and these workers were completely unemployed. There are many such situations in the society. More and more small businesses that are difficult to operate have begun to transfer funds into the financial market, regardless of the domestic stock market. In the international currency and futures markets, they are not generating profits through physical enterprises, and they prefer financial transactions that have little effect and almost no cost. A large number of workers have become unemployed. The security problems in some areas have become more and more serious. The disadvantages brought by the unemployed people have gradually emerged. The local councils also hope that some capitalists can solve these problems, but there is no use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening a factory, there is no investment finance to make money fast, and the risk is still so big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the federal financial industry, in addition to the transaction tax and transaction bank fees, no matter how much profit, no additional tax is required, which is left. A lot of money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his wife still wants to say something, the phone bell suddenly rang, he made a sorry move, climbed up from the sofa, I took the phone and went to the kitchen to sit down. "Here is Williams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"William, it is me, Befort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the sound of Befort, Williams’s spirit, he turned and turned his back to the living room and asked, “Is there any good news?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but you know, the rest of the first free will be charged. This time there is an internal message, freshly baked is very hot, five thousand.", the receiver The sound in the room made Williams excited immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded again and again, "No problem, I will give you six thousand pieces and tell me this good news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I like you to be bold, William, this is the best performance of a successful person.", he did not continue to sharpen, after reaching his own purpose, he quickly said his internal news, "know the Atlantic Chemicals? They have made a mysterious formula, it is said that the mass production problem has been solved, and it is planned to start putting into production in the near future. According to the information I got, once mass production is successful, they will change the existing pattern of some industries, you understand What do I mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
