			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Edgar feels like standing in front of a mountain, he is a small stone, Du Lin is the mountain, he really does not What is Du Lin can see, and rolling a stone from the mountain will be bigger and heavier than his size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at other people, the same is from smuggling, not only has a huge family, but also mixed into the new party team, became the mayor of Otis. Although the mayor of the city is not very valuable, it is the title. He believes that as long as Du Lin is willing to spend money to operate, it is very likely that he will be transferred directly to other places to continue to serve as mayor, and may even enter the internal organs of the New Party! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Edgar, has been engaged in the smuggling industry for more than ten years, and indeed has a little reputation in these years, and also raised three or four under his hand. The tenth person usually feels that he is well mixed, but he can sit opposite the one, and suddenly there is an illusion that he lives on the dog. At this moment, his heart is really breeding a trace of enthusiasm, instead of showing himself, it is a real embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edgar, who has always been a "businessman", suddenly found it very sad that he could get his hands, as if Dulin had it, and he was better than himself. More, better! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s a businessman or a politician, the premise of “transaction” is essentially “communication”, that is, there is something to get it, then consider "Easy" thing. He didn't have the hand to get the hand, and he didn't want to miss the opportunity that Du Lin spoke. It was really very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He racked his brains and couldn’t think of anything he could do to make Du Lin’s stuff, just that he couldn’t think of anything that could touch Du Lin’s desperation. When he looked up, he glanced at the young mayor who was too old. He suddenly noticed that Du Lin seemed to not expect him to say anything at all, perhaps that he knew he couldn't find anything tempting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who play smuggling are all very sensitive people. Edgar immediately abandoned his idea of ​​taking the idea and smiled and asked: "Mr. Doolin, you What do you want to get from me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly packed his mood, and on the surface he kicked the ball to Doolin, he I feel that Du Lin can open this condition, and he must have taken a certain aspect of himself or something, otherwise he will not be so expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when you want something, will you consider how to get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not hide. When he stood up, Edgar also stood up and the two walked to the window in tandem. Lin pushed the window and pointed to the dead city outside. He said: "Build something here. I don't care whether it is a high-rise building or a place of entertainment. I will build something and invest in a project. After that, your goods will go from me. Give you 20% of the points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as I have not left, I will guarantee that this promise will not change. If one day I leave I believe that at that time, the city will not allow the successor to ruin the rules of the game that we all set out together!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edgar looks out the window The city, sucking a cold breath, his scalp was slightly numb, and his body was even a layer of goose bumps! He only knew this time and realized that people and people are different. Not the same is not ambition and goals, but the mind, eyes! When he was thinking about how to reduce the 50% special tax by a little, Du Lin had already considered the rules of the game that did not belong to any party and political forces! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, as soon as he walks out of the City Hall, there will be rumors of tax cuts outside, which will attract more people to come here. And bowed his head in front of Doolin, obeyed his will and defended his rules of the game, and built it into a private kingdom that belongs to him! When the interests of all people are the same, Du Lin will become the king without a crown here. His will is the will of the city, the will of all forces! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that's why Edgar's scalp is numb. He was still watching the money and praised him when he was careful. He even succumbed to the fact that he had just risen. Du Lin’s age is too small! He still has at least 50 years of time on the stage of the empire. The ghost knows what he will become in fifty years. Perhaps he has planted it on the way to become the bones of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is also possible to be steady and risk-free to embark on the pinnacle of life and let the whole world fall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as Dulin said, once every inch of the city has traces of power, the entire city’s forces Have the same voice. No one can change any of the rules here except to build the king of the city. Because no matter who wants to change the rules, even a small change that is insignificant and inconspicuous, will lead to a series of big problems, even against the entire city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edgar believes that there will be no "good guys" here. If anyone dares to challenge the bottom line of these bad guys, then the end will definitely be miserable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recovered from the exclamation, this decaying and ruined city has become different in his eyes, he realized that this is a good The opportunity, whether it is due to Du Lin, or to invest here to profit, is an excellent thing. This time he didn't hesitate even hesitated, and decided to make a decision immediately! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, thank you very much for giving me such an opportunity. I don’t know much about other things, but warehouses and bars... if you can, I am willing to start construction immediately!" Although Edgar is very optimistic about Du Lin and the future development of the city, but there is no blind big bag, he knows what kind of material he is, especially compared with Du Lin. After the Fan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing those unfamiliar businesses, he is not at work, not even understanding, but to do things that he is familiar with, then he can be clear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not reject him, nodded directly and agreed, and then we said so, as long as your bar and warehouse began to work. Built, your goods will go from here, all as long as 20% of the business tax!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edgar also tightly shook hands with Doolin again "I will call people immediately, please rest assured!" At this time Edgar was energetic, maybe because of his wise move, he would change his future in the future! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it was Du Lin who taught Edgar how to strip private wine out of the special tax collection list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Du Lin registered a lot of patents after arriving in Irian, and some discoveries. For example, in a period of time, when a scientist discovers that the concentration of wine exceeds a certain limit, it will produce an excellent killing of bacteria in the test article, and this thing that he calls high alcohol. For clinical use, there are further major discoveries. At the same time, another good luck guy discovered how to extract the hidden alcohol in the wine to the extent of medical treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the advocacy of media public opinion, alcohol can be a magical thing that can play almost anywhere. With new discoveries and emerging news, people will realize that alcohol plays an important role in life, in medicine, and even in the industrial industry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the production cost and price of cheap alcohol is far cheaper than what is being used now, it is easier to produce, and it is more popular! Under the many good news, plus some of Doolin's operations, there will be new news coming from the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, alcohol is not a drink, but a medical and industrial necessity. This is something that is closely related to people’s lives. Naturally, no special tax can be levied. Instead, it should be lowered. And this is why Dulin dared to promise Edgar! After the door is closed, there is a set of documents and tax receipts. Who dares to say that the bottle contains wine instead of alcohol? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin holds the patent in his hand, grasps the "method", grasps a series of patent barriers, and he has the power of "enforcement" Anyone who wants to set foot on this piece is destined to pay a heavy price. If you don't want to offend Du Lin, don't want to pay for it, it's very simple, buy the license from Doolin here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a tycoon in the field of hospitality, but when it is a tycoon in the wine industry, it may not be difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edgar left the room with confidence, and soon a message spread in Nam Lindes, saying that there is a special way in the city of Otis It is possible to safely go out with a lower tax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news is not spread by Dooling, but Edgar took the initiative to help Du Lin, since he feels that he can get more from Doolin. The actual benefits, then why not just a little more thorough? Perhaps this is the gap between the people who are bloody and the people who are savvy, and it is not necessary to tear off the skin. A twist and pinch, and finally may not be able to please others, but will offend people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, many people are still waiting to see, one is to determine whether the line of Otis is really reliable. In case of a problem, the loss is not a star or a half. Secondly, I feel that the 50% special tax is too painful. I suddenly lost more than half of my income, so that some people think that this is a good route, but they are not willing to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that it takes less time and effort to take a steam locomotive than to go by themselves, but the cost is not necessarily affordable for everyone, or willing to squat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the news spread in the smugglers, there were more people going to the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
