			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After five o'clock, you will enter the federal territory after a 10km hike from here, and then you will encounter the federal police whistle when you head north. Raise your hands and tell them that you are a refugee who fled the empire, tell them that you have money in your pocket, they will arrange your remaining trip, remember?", the snakehead repeatedly told him how to tell him how to Cross the border line and flee to the Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Da’s has not had such a great name in the past few years, but there are still some friends. This snakehead was one of his friends. At the time, the other side transported a batch of "living things" from the site of Darcy. It happened that several girls escaped. This batch of goods is named by a big man. The snake head can only find Darcy through the relationship. I hope that Darcy can help him find a few girls to make up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darcy immediately agreed, on the one hand for money, on the other hand he also needs some friends with special skills. Sometimes the things of the people under his hands are exposed, and they must be arranged to leave the empire to avoid the limelight. In the past, Darcy sent people directly to the Federation through a cargo ship, and sent three people three times. As a result, one person was lost. This line did not intend to use it again. Just as this guy came to the door, he should have come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used for a long time, they aimed at a few federal female tourists who came to travel, and then decisively shot these female tourists to the snake head car. The task of the snakehead was perfectly completed, and the two sides had a good relationship and kept in touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time I found the other party, the other party did not say a word, did not ask a question, directly arranged his escape route, and gave him back The “passing fee” required at the border. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no military conflict between the federal and the empire in these years, but in the public opinion, the two sides are still smashing each other with great dedication. The federation said that the inhabitants of the empire were not living, and were bullied by aristocratic officials like bullies. The empire retorted that there was no way for the poor in the federation to go to the blood factory to make a living. As long as the two sides can find an opportunity to stand on the moral high ground, they must not let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A refugee like a refugee is the best news point, concocting Darcy’s tragic “flight route” and gaining good results in public opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darcy patted the shoulder of the snake head, licking his lips, his eyes were slightly red, he did not say anything thank you, the other party can do this One step, the gratitude of the mouth is to insult the pure friendship between each other. The other party could not have known that he had offended Du Lin, even if he explained that Du Lin had let him go, no one would believe. Under such circumstances, I took on such a big relationship to let him leave, this is a true friend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake head turned and hugged him in a small compartment. "When you settle down there, give me a call. Maybe when I will pass, old friends will have a lining when they live together."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darcy nodded again, then took the family out of the car, under the illumination of the lights, in the moonlight bath, began to follow the direction of the snake head, began to cross the next door . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just less than ten minutes after they left, six pairs of lights in the distance quickly approached from a distance, and the modified lights would be around It is as white as it is. The cars slowly stopped at the side of the snake's head, and the window of the third car shook down, revealing a guy with a square face in his thirties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are a little bit stunned, so the snake head can't help but bow down. "They have passed?", the snake head responded, the other party did not ask, shake directly I opened the window and chased it in the direction of Darcy’s departure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the taillights of the cars, the head of the snake wiped the sweat on the head, not that he wanted to sell Darcy, but that he had to sell Darcy. The arrest of Darcy was not the person of Doolin, but the deputy director of the General Administration of Police Investigations personally ordered that this level of big men would kill a bottom-up gangster, just a pout. Even if he and Darcy ran to the Federation, they could not escape the assassination of the Intelligence Section. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t want to do this, but he had to do it again. A snakehead who did the smuggling business was not great enough to be able to sacrifice himself for others. He ordered a cigarette and took a few mouthfuls, and he threw the bulk of the cigarette in the Gobi outside the window. The steering wheel made a fierce turn and stepped on the power cabin pedal in the direction of the empire, and life continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After almost fifteen minutes, Darcy looked up at the moon and gave birth to countless emotions. He finally got out of this ghost place, and the new life is Bet on him. According to the current exchange rate between the Empire Star and the Federal Shield, he can get almost 2.2 million federal shields. This money is as amazing a wealth as the Federation, enough for their family to live comfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the family, not only his wife, but also one of his mistresses, and two illegitimate children. There are two mistresses who are unwilling to leave the empire with him, so go home, Darcy will not force them, the road is their own choice, whether it is a dead end or not, it is their own business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as he was thinking about his future life, he suddenly found his own shadow on the ground. He jerked back and couldn't open his eyes as if he was stabbing like an incandescent car. No matter who these people are, he realizes that he is finished. At this moment, he turned and ran, what his wife's family, in the face of death, seems to be far from his own life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the wheel crushing stones is getting closer and closer, the expression on his face is getting more and more desperate, and suddenly he sees his wife holding his own child. He passed by him like a cannonball, and then his lover, his illegitimate child, followed by a dull crash, his pace gradually slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can someone run over? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gasped with a big mouth, watching the wife lying on the ground and vomiting blood and the child who had fallen into a coma, slowly turning around and holding his hands up , kneeling on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle of the car's headlights are covered with blood, through the blood to shine a faint red, the door opens, a man came out. He walked to the west and asked him with a blank expression. "What did Du Lin ask you, what did you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and shivered Asked: "I said that I can live?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man replied: "You will die very easily!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, the deputy director of the General Administration of Police Investigation was awakened from his sleep. He immediately inserted one hand under the whole head, took the pistol out and opened the insurance. After about three seconds, the phone of the "Spiritual" sounded, and he let out a sigh of relief. He took the pistol out of the bedroom and answered the call in the study. His face was very bad, but it became even worse after the call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him realize that he might be in trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it’s not his idea to arrange Darcy’s assassination of Otis. It’s not his idea, he and Du Lin’s After the holidays, I have not even seen each other. How can I do this kind of thing? If it wasn’t for Harry to call him, please ask him to get this thing done and give him a move as soon as possible. He would never do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is only 47 years old this year. He still has twenty-one years from the end of his political career. As a forty-seven-year-old politician who can become the deputy director of the Imperial Police Investigation Bureau, he and the same class of politicians Have the same ambitions. He does not intend to be a high-ranking party, nor does he expect to be a party to the ruling party. He only hopes that after four years, he may be able to win the position of the chief of the police investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get this position and opportunity, someone must help him, and Harry is obviously the most suitable person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is saying that he will be the next prime minister after four years of change. The current chief of the police investigation is a man of Magus, people say Harry and Magus's relationship is very good, like a father and son, but he is very clear, even if they are true fathers and sons, the first thing after Harry took office is to promote his own people, while sweeping down the characters of the Magus era. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is nothing about gratitude and friendship. This is a necessity on the political road. If he does not do this, does it mean that Magus is still ruling the empire? Who is the real prime minister? Therefore, he must change his own person, and Mr. Deputy Director is his person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he promised something that was not related to him, something that seemed simple to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Darcy top the case, then quickly sent him to jail, and then found a chance to sneak him out, this matter That's it. Even if Doolin would be suspicious, Doolin’s suspicion could only be suspected on the premise of Darcy’s death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is here, he mistakenly underestimated Doolin’s strength on the East Coast, and Du Lin actually mobilized the Navy to help him steal people and let The person he arranged was a step late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very likely that Du Lin will point the finger at himself, which is what bothers him most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inexplicably provoked a political enemy, and not for his own sake, how much more painful? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, the deputy director who did not sleep well just got up and brought the milk into the study room. He called Harry’s phone and responded to him after the opposite. Said: "Harry, he recruited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
