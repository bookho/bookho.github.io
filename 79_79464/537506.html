			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood outside the door, raised his hand and knocked on the door, and the dull voice alerted Kevin who was packing his luggage. He stood up straight from the waist and shook a few times before he licked his arm and walked over to greet Du Lin into the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin carefully crossed the pile of documents in the past, he looked at the documents and some salutes, showing a bright smile, "Congratulations You Kevin, you have done what you want to do, this is great!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin accepted the praise of Doolin with joy and he took it. I took Du Lin’s arm and turned to get him a cup of coffee and put it in the corner of the table. “I just cooked it, the temperature should be just right, you know I don’t drink, so...” he shrugged. “Yes. What makes you come to me, if I remember correctly, the two big men should be able to help you settle most of the things in the city of Tener?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Du Lin picked up the cup and saucer, and squeezed the small cup of ear with the other hand. He picked up the coffee and smelled it on the tip of his nose, then took a sip. He pretended to have the coffee in his mouth swallowed, but he quickly put the coffee back on the table. He couldn't enjoy the strange taste. "Their level is not enough. I hope to be able to build with higher-level characters." A channel, such as the mayor and the Honourable Member."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin curiously looked up and down Du Lin, could not help but blurt out and asked: "What the hell are you? What troubles, or is it bloated to think that a private wine dealer who has no fame can directly talk to the officials at the level of the mayor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I am not sarcastically Satire you, but I am telling the truth, they are unlikely to meet you, even if you see you, will not establish any friendship with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin said that human nature is not deliberately demeaning Du Lin. For the big man of that level, Du Lin is a little guy who doesn't even have a fart. No matter what he did, before he became a tycoon in the city, his grades were not enough for that level, let alone the relationship between the mayors and the giants like the councillors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not evade this question, he directly said the truth, "Wood may have used some price, please move the Dole to deal with me. You know I have a little bit of work under my hand, but I am still far worse than the big bosses of the East Side that have been so many years in the East. The problem now is that I have to find a way to stop Codor from interfering with me and Wood. Between the things, so I can only come to you, with the help of higher levels of characters and power, to pressure Sador to force him to change the plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Kevin put down the work of manually sorting out the working papers and luggage. He walked down to the chair opposite Du Lin and sat down with exaggerated expression: "My God, you can actually put the Chowdor Inspired, you are really not afraid of death.", he couldn't help but laugh. "The guy who wants to get into the upper class, maybe a big man's pocket is short of money, he is a few In the past, there have been very few murders, and I have been doing whitewashing activities for myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ridiculing Du Lin, Kevin also I began to think seriously. After a while, he said: "I can help you with the mayor...the lady, but how to use this line to introduce the mayor, I have no way, no time, only rely on You yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not force Kevin to leave, he had discussed with Kevin before, I hope Kevin can stay to help himself. But Kevin did not agree. His pursuit is not in this small city, but in a big city full of temptations. If you want him to stay, it is no longer a problem that can be solved with money. Although Du Lin regrets this, there is no way to leave this star of tomorrow that is smart enough to change the legal results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a seemingly childish commitment between the two, and if one day Doolin entered the heart of the empire as a winner, then Kevin Will immediately quit all the work and serve Du Lin. Of course, Du Lin must also give him a salary that fits his identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mayor’s wife, Vivian, is a typical Ogildin upper-class hostess. Her tastes and styles are very high, and she likes it on weekdays. The activity was to organize women of the same status to arrange flowers or to have tea parties. Vivian’s father served as governor of one time and later had to leave the governor’s post because of serious illness. But even then, His father also gained sufficient status and support during his four-year governorship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was because of Vivienne that the mayor succeeded. From the seven candidates, he became the mayor of the city of Tener. For the requirements and suggestions of Vivian, the mayor often chooses to support and affirm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can get the woman, you will no longer be in trouble!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin turned from the business card holder After a while, I turned over a business card and handed it over. "This is the business card of the director of the Delil Art Museum. You say that Kevin describes his meeting with you again As for the rest, I have no good way to help you, you know "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;.! & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
