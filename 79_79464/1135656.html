			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Webster just finished an entertainment, he was sitting on the sofa in his home, his face showing a tired look, but occasionally opened his eyes Also a hint of satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city is, after all, to accept him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Webster was a state legislator before coming to Otis. After struggling for many years, he was mixed into this position. He felt that he might be in forty. When you are around the age, you can go further and become the mayor of a certain city, the main party. Then he spent years in a less important position until he retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until one day he was informed by his superior that the special agent of the Imperial Capital came to see him, he knew that he was named as a mayor by the new party committee executives, let him prepare Hand in the hands of the hand, then take office immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sudden surprise made him, including his family and friends, very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a step between the members of the House of Representatives and the mayor. For Websters who do not have strong strength and lack background background, every step It takes more than ten years of hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surprise came so suddenly that he forgot to ask, where he would be transferred to serve as mayor, and surprise until he was sent to Otis . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very special city. As long as people who pay attention to the political stage of the empire know the particularity of the city of Otis, this is the first of the empire. The SAR was established, and it was also where Du Lin showed his detached means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Du Lin, even if there is a certain background of the Donald, the mayor has been removed from the former mayor who has been removed from the city of Otis This shows how terrible Du Lin’s influence on the city is? ! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After taking office, Webster took a cautious attitude and stepped forward to find forward, for fear of ruining his future for some inexplicable reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, these are all rewarding, and the extremely exclusive city of Otis has begun to accept him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening’s entertainment is organized by some of the seven major shareholders, and there is no substantive theme, it’s more like everyone sitting down and relaxing, by the way The next city policy. He enjoys this feeling and integrates into the city and becomes a "self" feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the reception, the seven major shareholders said that they would continue to support Webster in the general election and let him stay here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good thing. The particularity and importance of the city of Otis will inevitably make his performance experience here the most eye-catching achievement on his resume. Getting to know so many big people can also make his future path wider and wider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up at the wrist and looking at the watch, the watch with the mirror-transparent gemstone surface quietly shows the unparalleled luxury even in the night, which is sent by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than eleven o'clock, it's time to sleep, there will be a town hall meeting to host tomorrow morning, just as he prepares to wash and go to sleep, suddenly the doorbell The sound rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than eleven o'clock, you can enter the community under the name of the City Hall of Otis, definitely a person from the City Hall, or a person with a face in Otis. Outsiders can't get in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He patted his face and walked to the entrance. "Who is there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one Answer, or answer him only the more hurried doorbell. He walked to the door with some suspicion, hung the door chain, opened a seam, and with the faint light outside the door, he saw a terrible person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drunkenness in the body is gone for a moment, and even the coldness of the blood is cold. At this moment, my mind changed and my face changed, but I finally opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No way, in the city of Otis, Doolin is the god that people need to look up to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
