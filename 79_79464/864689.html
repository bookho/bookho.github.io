			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for more than 20 minutes, Alisa’s crying gradually stopped, she stood up and went outside the bathroom to take off her clothes. The fruit went in. The sound of the shower made Du Lin feel a little worried, he remembered the day Kevin was invited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl whose name is called is soft like a bone. Listening to Kevin said that most women from theaters are like this. They are young. It is necessary to undergo strict physical training, and all kinds of postures can be put on you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a smile on the face that Du Lin didn’t know. He touched his chin and didn’t know what he thought. He couldn’t help but laugh. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shower sounded abruptly, and Du Lin looked at the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hotel was not built to be a hotel, so each house has a limited area and there are not so many bends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa pushed the door and walked out, and the water droplets popped out of the skin with her every step. After taking a bath towel and drying her hair, she walked over to Doolin and looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time that Doolin has appreciated a woman’s body, nor is it the first time she saw Alice in red fruit. He felt that Alisa's emotions were a bit wrong. She took the bath towel from her hand and wrapped Alisa. He could feel that Alisa's body was still shaking slightly through the palm of her hand. She looked up at Du Lin with her face up, and some strange light in her eyes was flashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our children can't find it, right?", she wrapped her towel and lowered her head. This time she didn't have a heartbreaking Cried, there was no hysterical attempt to make an unexpected move, so I held myself, bowed my head and cried silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drops of water and tears drip together, so that Du Lin can't tell which drop is tears, which drop is water drops, "Why would you say that?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa has some laughter in the liver. "You still don't understand? One year, they can't find our children, they just don't Stop telling me, I will find... I will find it. When can I 'find it'? They don’t even know who took our children, but let me wait for their news. Du Lin... "She looked up at Du Lin. The red eyes were already red and swollen. "Our children can't find it, right? Even if you are, you can't find it, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin suddenly felt a bit of pain in his gums. He pouted and pretended to think for a while, and gave an answer full of hope. "Yes, we will find him, I swear!", at the same time he I also thought about how to solve this problem. When I was almost at the same time, I told Alisa that he had brought the child back, but because of the safety of the child, Mr. Xiaoxma would be fostered in Ziwei Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perfect solution, Du Lin’s guilty feelings caused by Alisa’s previous pain outside the station disappeared instantly, which made him a lot easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Trust me, I can definitely get him back...", Du Lin continued to comfort Alisa, he felt that Alisa's mood was wrong, What if Alisa commits suicide in desperation after he leaves? So he decided to stay, take good care of the girl, and then wait for the day to call Mr. Bain and let him pick up Alisa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The towel on Alisa suddenly fell to the ground, and she held Du Lin tightly. "Let's regenerate one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... Why do I feel that my ability to think can't keep up with your rhythm?" Du Lin made a joke, but he saw a really serious expression, this It may indeed be Alisa's idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t understand why I have to be born with myself, the idea itself is a bit confusing, perhaps to transfer emotions? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Doolin was still confused, Alisa had bitten his neck gently... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, when the sun was transmitted through the thick curtains into the room, Du Lin woke up in a sigh, or after waking up The first sigh. He glanced at Alisa lying on the bed, turned and sat up, looking at the yellowed ceiling that could not be hidden after hiding the white paint, feeling that he might not have control over his desire. However, he thought about it and thought it was normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, I am still young, how can I completely grasp all the desires in my hands like the big dreams in my dreams? And when the old man was young, he seemed to be passing through the flowers, which made him a little more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the face with tears and legs tightly gripping the quilt of Alisa, Doolin put her quilt on her body, Covers the skin with a healthy color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a little crazy last night. When he stood up, he felt his legs were a bit sour. Alisa transferred her feelings for Mr. Xiaoxma to one of the 200 million children who might not have found the right place. One body. He feels that it will be better to explain this matter after a while, at least there must be an "operational" process. He does not believe that his gun is so accurate, so there is no burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rinsed his body and put on his clothes, maybe the movement was a little bigger, or for some other reason, Alisa also woke up. . Her eyes looked awkwardly and circled around Du Lin after a round of laps. The sharp perception of her body told her that her body had changed. The next moment she wrapped herself tightly and licked her teeth. Shouted "despicable"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, is there something that is not quite right, Du Lin looks at Alisa with a sneak peek, and Alisa squats back. . Ok, now Du Lin is relieved. At this time, Alisa has come out of the mood of yesterday’s collapse. He shrugged his shoulders. , make a helpless expression, turn and push the door to leave. There are still a few things that he needs to deal with in the morning. He doesn't have time to explain anything here, or his children's feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Du Lin left, Alisa’s expression returned to nature, she jumped out of bed and locked the door, then looked down at her stomach and gently Stroking, the face of the sacred motherhood shines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After yesterday's vent, she was much better, with a sigh of relief on her back, and the sorrow of her eyes flashed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some things can be transferred, but some things can't be forgotten! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is forcing Du Lin, but she is not willing to give Du Lin too much pressure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Alisa may not know that Du Lin actually has no burden at all because he knows where the child is and thinks of a good solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn’t long before I arrived at the office in the morning, and Merlin came with Dove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want me to do?", Merlin sat on the couch, he didn't really like the soft sofa, he liked hard like a stone The chair, sitting a little uncomfortably forward, "If you can learn something, don't send me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem is really a bit difficult. Originally, he also planned to learn from the big man in the dream, and let two warehouses let them play, but later I thought that Merlin was his own brother. When he was a child, he helped himself to do it. A lot of work, not giving him a chance is really a bit unreasonable. After a brief thought, Du Lin returned the problem to Merlin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you like to do? Or what kind of person do you want to be?", Du Lin took a cigarette and put it on his mouth, then put it all together. The boxes have been lost. The three brothers sneaked cigarettes twice at home, and they drank a lot of fruit wine. He spit a smog, "Police, lawyers, doctors, teachers... this is not the case, or a businessman, etc., what job I give you depends on what you want to do."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin recalled what he would do. It seems that he will not have much more than cattle and farming. Oh, yes, he will fight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strongest fighting in Zizhen Town is undoubtedly the "half-long race" of the Layton family, followed by Mr. Kesma’s family, each year. The border stone of more than one hundred kilograms in the field will inexplicably run a few meters to other people's homes. Mrs. Mazma will explain that the wind is too big, but according to others, it is Mr. Kesma’s family who secretly harvested their food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to solve problems in the country is never to find someone to solve, but to use your own fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Ziwei Town, the fighting power of Mr. Kesma’s family is obvious to all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is not what I want to do. Merlin scratched his head. He didn’t know how to express his thoughts. In the end, he could only mutter: "You see Let's arrange it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you let everyone choose the most annoying word, it might be the word "just", because you never know how much "just" the other person is. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin blinked his eyes for a long time and didn’t know how to arrange it. After a long while, he thought of a place, "I will give you first Find a school, learn to read and write, and then learn something you are interested in, how about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin nodded, "You look Just arrange it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
