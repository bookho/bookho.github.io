			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwell has not been fully relieved until now, and it’s only one side, and on the other hand, he has become the city of Otis. The representative of the opposition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, people agree that Deville’s reason stems from his conversation with Doolin in the church, the effect of that words in Du Lin’s view. It may be very bad, destroying a series of core content behind him. But in the eyes of locals, Deville’s words really represent the voices of all of them. They are satisfied with their current life. They don’t want to make any big changes. They just want to be able to manage them as before. Let them live a "high degree of autonomy". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city is not a city of empire, not a city of the New Party, a city of the old party, or a city of the mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, is the city of all Otis! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because most people have this idea, they have no special emotions for the new mayor, that is, you come, we don’t Welcome, you are gone, we are not sad, indifferent. The most popular thing for Diwell is that when Du Lin asked him what requirements and hopes for his life to change, he used the word silence and satisfaction to counter Doolin and let Du Lin know this. The city does not need him, he is superfluous here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sentimental human beings are social animals, and they all need recognition and recognition from society. A few days ago, people may not know who Devil is, what is the story, what has been done. Soon after those words were passed out, some middle-aged and old people recognized him soaringly. When he walked down the street, someone would take the initiative to greet him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diver gradually felt that there was a heavy burden on his shoulders, from the strange and slight resistance at the beginning, to some enjoying the feeling He has been addicted to it without knowing it. This feeling of being needed is something he has never felt before in his lifetime. The pair of eyes are full of affirmative eyes. When each warm palm is with him, a voice constantly affirms in his heart. Something he didn't pay attention to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is called social responsibility, social responsibility given by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Het couldn't help but look up and look at this guy again. He has already heard that the president encountered some problems when he planned to set up a branch here. The biggest problem is this person called Dewell. He is curious as to what kind of person will reject the rejuvenation of a nation and will refuse others to extend his arm from heaven. Now he saw, an ordinary person, the only impression left to Hite is that this guy's back is very straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing here?" Hite bowed his head again, and he was a little bit stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diver tears his sleeves and wraps his wounds. "We are here to stop the parks that push them to the center of the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Why? As far as I know, the park in the city center does not belong to anyone, but also to you, you have no right to interfere with the decree of the City Hall...", Doolin I don't know when I have arrived at the scene. He opened the crowd and walked over from Hite. Hite took the initiative and stood by. Du Lin looked at this familiar guy and asked softly. His tone is very calm, and it is also very light. He does not seem to have emotional questions, just a casual question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwell doesn't know that Dulin will arrive at the scene so quickly, and he doesn't know what they are doing, and will lead Doolin. Many people, including him, think that this is only a trivial matter. Du Lin will know about it, and then the two sides will start negotiations and find an intermediate point that everyone can accept to decide things. Dooling continued to level his center, and the opposition, in addition to receiving some compensation, also won a victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the conclusion of their thinking. After all, Du Lin is also the mayor of a city. It is impossible to personally control everything. The City Hall has fed so many people to do what they do, isn’t it to worry about the mayor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diver's mouth is a "Mr. Doolin", and he has not had time to say it. Du Lin shook his head and interrupted his language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We were all compatriots in the church that day, so anyone can call me Mr. Doolin. But today we are not in that sacred place, It's on the streets of Otis, so you have to take my job title, this is the most basic courtesy!", Du Lin glanced at him, as if laughing and laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diwell repeated his head and repeated it. "Mr. Doolin, you have just arrived in Otis, and the situation here is not clear. There are many crops planted in the park in the city center. These crops can not only increase. The role of green plants can also allow some poor families and some elderly people living alone to get some food supplies.” Dewell said that he was also paying attention to Du Lin. He saw Du Lin listening very seriously. Go on, "If you level the park in the city center, it will make a lot of people hungry, so everyone hopes that you can have a way to resettle these people, which is why we are here."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked down at his injured arm and pointed and said: "Is your arm okay?", Devil shook his head, and Du Lin suddenly laughed. Up, "Mr. Dewell, there are three problems in what you said just now. The first problem is that the park here is not a private property of a citizen or citizen. It does not belong to anyone. No one buys it. This Before the land, it belonged to the empire and belonged to the city hall. The 'these people' in your mouth, with the consent of the city hall without the city, destroyed the public property in the park, and it has already violated the law."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second question, the city itself has a shelter, and the shelter is also responsible for relief. Anyone who can't afford a meal can go to the shelter to get help, I believe There won't be starving anyone. If someone is starved to death, the person in charge will take all the responsibilities. This can't be a reason and excuse for some people to destroy the park and occupy non-private land, and it is not a bridge of morality to cross the law." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The third question, before you gathered here, did you apply to the relevant office of the City Hall, or tell?" Devil snorted. Then he shook his head and Du Lin’s tone became a bit harsh. “You didn’t inform the City Hall of the notice to convene a large number of citizens to gather together, and seriously interfered with the construction of urban construction projects. Ask Mr. Dewell, who gave you the courage and power to let you trample on the law several times?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, the empire is a jurisprudence The empire, everyone is equal before the law, as long as you break the law, you will not escape the legal sanctions. I hope that when you see you next time, you can be as calm as you are now.", Du Lin finished talking low After a moment, he took out his hand from the pocket and rubbed the dust on his neckline, then leaned his head and looked at Hite. "Take the suspect who illegally called the opportunity to take it back. Other organizations participated in and implemented this. The organizers of the illegal plan also implement their identity as soon as possible, and I need to see them accept the law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Devil still wanted to say something, Hite hit his face with a fist, and with what he was going to say, swallowed back with the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin crossed Di Weier and went to the crowd. The people in the crowd had already heard what Du Lin had just said, and they stepped back involuntarily, one by one. All with a hint of coziness. They are willing to oppose the mayor and oppose the city hall to push the park in the center of the city, but it does not mean that they are willing to "illegal" and accept "trial." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group effect collapsed under the collision of a car, and the momentum that has been reckless in the past has vanished, leaving only deep fear of the consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the new mayor of Otis City. Today I am standing here to tell you everyone. Building the city of Otis is the common responsibility of all citizens. Only the city is well built, and those who leave the city will return to here and reunite with you. I believe that everyone in the city of Otis hopes that this will become another nano Lindes, even more than nano Lindes, this requires us to work together!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some people don't know what the purpose is, don't want the city to become rich, beautiful, and You don't want to live here, you become rich, you don't want you to be able to reunite with your family, and you are bewildered by these people, obeying their full of distorted and malicious guidance, standing on the opposite side with me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that some people may be brainwashed a bit serious, think that I am telling lies, empty words. I also know that some people have come to wake up and realize themselves The error."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today, I am here to make a promise with everyone..." Du Lin stretched out three fingers in front of everyone. "In three years, if Otis can't As prosperous as Nano Lindes, I quit and resign!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd seems to have been thrown into a bomb, instantly like a tumbling boiled water, 喧嚣The sound is straight into the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three years, I will resign. In the presence of so many people, even if Du Lin is a shameless person, it is impossible to be in the position of the mayor. Continue to rely on. This is not what he said to a certain individual, a small monk, but to the citizens of the entire city. Undoubtedly, every word and every sentence he said will spread throughout the city in the shortest time. Once he can't do it, he will be cast aside by the whole city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
