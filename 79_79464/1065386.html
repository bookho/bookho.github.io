			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Secretary, the school's people are coming!", the little police officer also has a little bit of dissatisfaction, Mason's sense of existence is too weak, he is not clear about the Secretary and What is Du Lin's relationship? It seems that the two are very familiar and familiar with being able to ignore each other's existence. No, it is a unilateral neglect. Just as the people of the school arrived, how many can make the Secretary find some decent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason heard the words and stood up and walked out of the interrogation room. The headmaster of the school looked like he was in his forties, and he was dressed in a light blue dress. With the eyes of gold silk, there is indeed a little bit of cultural work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Director Mason, thank you very much for your work, have people already caught it?" The headmaster took a step forward and held Mason’s hand. I was grateful. "If it weren't for you, I heard that the loss might be more, thank you very much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sitting in the room watching Mason The mellow and principal’s gossip has a feeling of not being able to come up. This feeling was not tasted until recently. The bastards have grown up, matured, and no longer follow the rules and become uncontrollable. Maybe Mr. Kemer has the same feeling. Look at this big boy who is ashamed and innocent when he is in the country. Only a few years later, he became a qualified police chief, and Du Lin even felt from him. It’s a little bit called Guanwei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is really amazing, plus a more magical society, everyone who falls into this big dye tank is constantly changing colors, changing positions, always No one can guess what these people will look like next time and where they stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment of chilling for a moment, the headmaster walked in and stood up. He didn’t look at the four people in the room, they were very young, the biggest one. The age seems to be in his early twenties. The head of the principal suddenly showed a hint of hatred, and even the eyebrows slowly stood up. He walked over to the table and looked down at a few people. He shook his head hard. "Look at what you look like. If you don't do anything at a young age, you have to steal things. I think you still have a gang?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you considered the feelings of your parents? Have you considered the feelings of your family? It’s really shameful!" He raised his hand. I want to take a picture to express my emotional outburst. But he casually saw the expressions of these people and their eyes. I don’t know why his heart was cold. The raised hand didn’t take it. Instead, he made a simple waving action. “To make you young people. I can go back to the road, I have already discussed with the school council, I want to sue you. Perhaps only the prison can let you understand how stupid your current behavior and choices are, so that you can find the way back to the right path. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't hate us, this is saving you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks like a very high-sounding word, but in fact it is also discussed with him on the way. The content, they intend to threaten these young people through prosecution, let them realize the bad situation they may have to face. In such a situation, even if the school is slightly more involved in claiming compensation, the families of these people will agree. After all, giving a little more money can help your child avoid jail, which is very attractive to the families of these young people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once they enter the prison, it will inevitably become worse because of the messy environment inside, maybe this life will be completely destroyed by this prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason, who was standing outside the door and chatting with the school director, glanced at the room and took his eyes back. He knew that Du Lin would not have anything to do," Please rest assured, I guarantee with my personality that there will be no problem in the security of the city of Tener.", Mason’s words are loud, but the school’s director looked at the crowd gathered outside the police station. I don’t know why. I feel that this sentence is a bit imaginary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not for those people who have been standing and not moving, and here is the police station, he may not dare to let the driver drive the car over. “There is really a sentence for you. It’s great, I have an idea, I don’t know if I can hire several police officers to patrol the school... I mean, after the school, our school will pay the salary of these police officers.” The school is located in the lower city. The lower city will never have the elegance and civilization that is unique in Shangcheng, even if it is not so safe in school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad students gangs form a gang of gangs, often fight for the "site" in the school, which makes the school's environment become smoky Many capable families have already transferred their children to private schools. The more the result is, the more students are left in the school, and the more people are blatantly starting to threaten the teacher. This is absolutely not allowed. Therefore, the director of the school feels that if the police can enter the campus, it will definitely play a decisive role in the security problem on campus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When talking about how to cooperate with Mason, the headmaster slid slightly out of the room with his head down. As he wiped the sweat from his head, he whispered in the ear of the school director. "This seems to be a little troublesome. The person inside is Doolin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin?", the director apologized and smiled at Mason, apologizing for the principal to interrupt the conversation between the two, and then he said with some dissatisfaction, "Who is Doolin? How about Du Lin...", his face The expression changed and stiffened. I asked for a long time, "What do you mean by the young Guart called Doolin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon Two people invited Mason to enter the interrogation room. They have already identified the identity of the person inside from Mason. At this time, there is nothing to preach. There is nothing to be arrogant. Doolin’s fierce name is useful to anyone, especially in the area of ​​the city of Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the school’s director asked, Doolin waved at him, and the latter went to a place not far from Doolin but some distance. Shouted Mr. Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a little too late at night, you quote a price, I compensate for it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dooling wants to give it, the school's directors and principals don't want to accept it. There are also some Guart students in the school. These students never get into trouble on weekdays, and spend all their time studying all day. But as long as someone took the initiative to provoke them, there would be nothing too good to end, which also made the school understand the terrible degree of this group. Plus Du Lin was a tycoon who had killed a tycoon like Wood. He had a nickname, called a celebrity killer, when Dolin himself didn't know it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin deliberately put on his face and pretend to be angry, the school only accepted Du Lin’s compensation, two thousand. Originally, they said that three hundred pieces were enough. Du Lin asked Jupiter to give them two thousand pieces. When the school refused to say that it was all trivial and did not pursue Du Lin’s responsibility, a policeman ran into the room with a strange expression, licking Mason’s sleeves and carrying something outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Mason came back and looked at Du Lin and some didn’t know how to express his inner feelings. Just five minutes ago, there were two The young people came to the police station and surrendered, saying that they were the chief culprit in the teaching building. They were condemned by their conscience, so they came from the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if they are the criminal suspects who have destroyed the school’s property, what did Doolin do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, downstairs, the agent responsible for monitoring Du Lin changed a set of clothes that were not good people, and had the characteristics of obvious gang traces. He sat. On the chair, the back of the hand is tightly held and fixed on a handrail dedicated to the restraint of the suspect. After the counter, a policewoman is filling in the transcript according to the content of his confession. In fact, he is also very helpless, the headmaster went in, Mason is also inside, so long time has not come out is definitely something that has not been settled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
