			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw Buddy again, this guy’s left arm was tied with a bandage and hung in front of his chest, some red blood leaking out. His face is not good-looking, and he may not have seen it all the time. His eyes are full of bloodshot eyes, and there are fewer people who are next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and reached out. "I didn't expect this to be more difficult than I thought." His opening remarks illustrate the promotion of private wine during this time. Difficulties encountered in the fire. Buddy is a determined person who can withstand hardships, but he is not good enough, that is, he is too "honest". He is like Du Lin’s self-declared in the church. He deceives himself. As long as he works well and he is honest, he will be good one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until Du Lin’s letter appeared, he wanted to change, but some things could not be changed overnight, such as personality, such as habit. In several rounds, Buddy showed considerable courage at first, and in the end he always felt soft. It is because of his soft heart that those talents are unscrupulously constantly raising power to attack him and his people. He also knows this, but he knows that it is difficult for him to make some decisions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like people know that bad habits shouldn’t be developed, they shouldn’t be gambling, but they can’t help itching all the time, always have “last time” ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin came here to solve this trouble for Buddy. He won't stay here for a long time, he just wants to demonstrate how it should be. The three members of the fellowships that were left were also injured. They heard Du Lin said what to do, but after all, there was no actual operation, and some were counted as missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not go to his basement directly with Buddy, and there were more casualties in the basement, adding up to more than a dozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head, this is still a matter of concept, and this is precisely why he did it. You don't dare to squat, but others dare, then you can't lift your head for a lifetime, because when you look up, it means resistance, and a new round of brutal suppression will begin. There is no small thing between life and death, whether it is for yourself or for the enemy. You can't get rid of the enemy, but the enemy may not be kind to you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of the farmer and the snake is in every world, and kindness is the greatest betrayal of oneself, since ancient times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at the sickness of these people, and asked the forehead: "How many people can you use here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;布Di thought for a moment, "If these people are not enough, we can recruit a batch. Everyone wants to do something to change the life of the present. For decades, it should be changed!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin likes Budi very much, not because Buddy is an honest man, but because he has the determination to change. He patted Buddy's arm, pulled out the cigarette in his mouth, threw it on the ground, lifted his toes and grinded it. Smooth to the point on the tip of the leather shoe that reflects the figure, it is like a demon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me the information of the other party, pick three or five people that you feel are appropriate, and I will show you the next thing!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the most prosperous street in the city, there is a small bar called "Grandin", which is a nest called "Mountain Wolf" gang. This bar is rarely open to the public. It is a member of the Mountain Wolf gang. They are not doing business, just want to have a suitable place for everyone to relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolf of the mountain wolf is sullen, looking at the same wounded man, the anger in his eyes is almost spurting out, "but a group The inferior can make you like this. I feel embarrassed when I walk outside!" He lifted the bottle in his hand, dundundun poured a few mouthfuls, and many wines followed him. The mouth blew out. He lifted his sleeves and rubbed it, his eyes swept over his face, and the people he saw looked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boss, they don’t know where to get a bunch of pistols, we didn’t expect it, and now the police are chasing very tight, not dare I used the guns." Someone tried to explain it, and it was quickly picked up by the boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, when the Guarts started selling private wine to the bar, they thought that it was just this group of people who didn’t know which ship was stolen. A few boxes of dozens of boxes, almost sold out. Although the Guartes are very honest, there are always a few unscrupulous people in 10,000 honest people. The mountain wolf gang is also a bit of a hesitation, not taking care of this matter. How do you know that the group of Guartes are getting more and more energetic, which has caused the attention of the mountain wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of their wines is good, the price is two dollars cheaper than the goods they produce, for the bar, two dollars cheaper is equal to they earned four more Money, even six dollars. I can dare to sell wine when there is a prohibition on alcohol, or I have a deep background, or someone’s money bag. For these bars, I want to buy anyway, who’s good, who’s cheap, I Who to buy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found an opportunity to catch up with the Guar delivery team and hit the other one by surprise. Originally thought that this was just a cold spell between the cold weapons, who knows that the other side directly shot the gun instead of hitting them by surprise, the guy who took the three-and-a-half way to return to the old nest, triggered the next few fires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gang’s combat death rate for hot weapons is actually far lower than the death rate of cold weapons, because everyone knows that they will die if they don’t protect themselves. Both sides have come to me to fight for a few games, to say that the dead are really not dead, but basically everyone involved in the battle is wounded. If at this time, Budi sneaked on the headquarters of the mountain wolf gang, maybe there is no such thing behind, but Buddy is a "honest" person, actually thinks that this is a sign of the two sides' strike, he will let people continue to send wine. As a result, six people died here this time, and the other party only hung one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the two sides basically did not retreat, and Buddy stunned and fired two games, each winning or losing. He lost a lot of money here, a bit of fear, but instead called the mountain wolf to help the Buddy lack of energy, intending to oust these Guar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not for Du Lin, it’s time for this, and it’s really hard to say what Willis is going to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolf of the mountain wolf is drinking too much. His anger is not the loss and injury of his men. He is the same as Wood’s mind at the moment. Someone touched the lion's ass. If you can't fight back, then others will feel that the lion's ass can touch it. There are more than a dozen bars in Willis City, and there are five groups of people in the delivery, which is also the site that was set after the previous fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now some people have provoked the mountain wolf gang, the mountain wolf gang seems to be a mountain dog help, and some people are always ready to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dangerous sign. It’s totally different from the gang’s gang’s concept and the Guar’s rush. It’s really a war for you. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put down the bottle, smashed it, hit it, and the rest was to find out the bottom of Buddy as soon as possible, and then put this group of people Thoroughly eradicated. He put on his clothes and walked toward the bar door. He walked and said: "Give you three days to find out their source of goods, then throw them all into the sea to feed the fish. If you can't hear good news after three days, I will throw you all over the sea to feed the fish!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hit a cellar and swayed into his car. He suddenly heard the harshness of the tire rubbing against the ground during an emergency brake, just as he looked toward the car that blocked his car. At the time, two people came out of the window and pulled the trigger continuously while he was unprepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just the beginning. In the next few days, the mountain wolf will help all the cadres and members to be ambushed at any time and anywhere. There is no point. Call for. Buddy found the past in the police station, Budi also cooperated honestly, but the ambush outside is still going on. The City Hall has already had opinions, and if it does not stop such unscrupulous assassinations, it will be replaced by a police chief. The problem is that who is helping Buddy deal with these things, from the point of view of these people, it is not like the means of Willis this small place, but more Like those who have big docks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police chief is not a bad person. If he is forced to be the best person, there may be an outbreak. He has not been swaying to Buddy because he is not sure about the details of Buddy. Those wines, those pistols, and the assassins who have the style of the big docks all say that the people behind Buddy are not simple. What makes him a little confused is that since that guy has such a skill, why do you want Buddy's gorgeous honest person to act as an agent, can you change one? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you are looking for a mountain wolf to help as an agent, there are not so many things? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, the police chief took a few small dishes and walked into the pleading room with two bottles of wine in his arms. In Willis, this thing is officially supported by semi-public sales. The reason is very simple. There is too much work here with seafarers. There is no wine. Don’t say it in the winter, even if you go to the pier, no one will do it. . And if you go out to sea for a long time, it will inevitably fall down some roots. With these private wines, it is also a benefit to these seafarers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Prohibition Bureau, it’s like a gas bag, without the support of the city hall and the state, they are too lazy to manage, anyway The mayor is a new party, and the meat is rotten in the pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opened the door to the pleading room, the director put the side dish on the table, took the wine out, and poured a cup of Buddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While pouring wine, the Secretary asked with a pleasant color: "Old cloth, you and I said a truth, who is standing behind you, I will explain to the above, and guarantee You can be safe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
