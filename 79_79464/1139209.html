			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is oh!", Hersman slaps the newspaper in his hand, and there are still more than twenty days from the New Year. Satisfied, but at this time, there were some special things in the public opinion. "We should give these news a severe counterattack in newspapers and on television, and let them apologize."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Some tabloids with no cards are the kind of pseudo-charitable third-rate tabloids, to report how poor and undressable girls live a hard life, draw people’s attention, and leave a way to help girls. Newspaper. In these newspapers, there was a sudden negative news about Doolin about his private life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least from Hersman’s point of view, these are negative news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some essays that describe Dolin’s unknown private life. It’s as if it’s something, just as the reporter stood by and watched the whole The process is also shouting like that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helsman is very clear that people are often very interested in the private life of "celebrities" and take the initiative to put the news they know, as well as some guesses. Unselfish sharing to others. This is also the reason why the scandals about the royal family quickly spread throughout the empire in history, and people are discussing these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people meet at the bar, it’s absolutely impossible to sneak out Mimi and the friends who are close to you, hello, you know that the bill passed by the Imperial Parliament is seventh. Is the ninth interpretation of the eighth paragraph conflicting with the third interpretation of the third paragraph of the previous bill? My opinion on this matter is different from that of the lawmakers. I think the empire..., society..., people... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, what you said is very reasonable, but there are some differences between my opinion and your thoughts, I think... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone really said these things in the bar, then they must have ran out of the madhouse. At this time, you can call the police to send them where they should go. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information that can be actively spread in the crowd is often entertaining or satisfying information about people’s needs, especially those Negative news of celebrities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are more willing to discuss the privacy and scandals of certain celebrities. This kind of attack on people can be seen as something that is not perfect for a perfect Jedi counterattack, and People will be happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not that he is awesome, so I am a little bit worse, only to make him look very powerful!", we can hardly recognize the success and excellence of others, Even at the expense of degrading one's own way to refuse to recognize the success and excellence of others, perhaps from the day of human birth, hostile to all things beyond themselves has been buried in the depths of the gene<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s personal qualities in public opinion in public opinion have long been known. He has succeeded in shaping himself into a hero from the civilian population, the realization of the imperial dream, The miracle of the times is also the witness of the times. But this set of things said every day, the moon said that the people will one day be disgusted and will be disgusted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the newspaper every day, you can see a successful, wealthy, powerful young man talking about his own understanding of life, and himself "Insignificant" success. After the initial freshness faded, the content of the report was only the life attack of the red fruit, because every person who needs to pass through the newspaper to know Du Lin unilaterally will never be a successful person. At this time, some tabloids began to attack Du Lin, and they made some inferior news to discredit him. On the contrary, they were more in line with the psychological needs of the public. Most people in this society will not believe that there are perfect people in the world. Those who seem to be perfect are just hiding their jealous side, but now we have discovered this through newspapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal circumstances, these news did have a fatal impact on a politician, but Doolin refused Hersman to pursue these newspapers and write He has different opinions on people's ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can make these newspapers not publish such articles, even let them apologize to me in their own newspapers, but you can't suppress people's thoughts." Du Lin looked at Hersman, very serious. "Let them bow their heads and only release a wrong message to the people. That is, I am afraid, I cringe, I am desperate to use my own advantages, let these Those who dare to report the truth have bowed their heads. The bombs that have been detonated will not be misfiring, but will continue to explode and create greater power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
