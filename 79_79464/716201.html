			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William just got out of bed and found a pair of socks that were not too heavy in a pile of socks that smelled badly, and put them on the feet. The hard socks that were sweated and peeled off were somewhat poked, but he didn't care very much, because it would be nice to wear it for a while. He casually put on a fairly clean clothes, spit in his palm, pressed the hair that was messed up by sleeping, and made a cool look at himself in the mirror. The expression, then push the door away. He spends almost every day in the bar next door, which is his life and his work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When entering the bar is still noon, there are no guests, often hot to the lady who wants to undress, sitting on the stage with a bowl of lunch He looked up at him and paid attention to his lunch. The bartender was very enthusiastic, greeted him sitting on the edge of the bar and offered a glass of wine worth 20% for free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William is a regular customer here, and here is where he works. He will collect some information here, and occasionally go elsewhere to make a turn. Some information does not have any value, and it may not be used for a long time, but as long as there is an intelligence needs, he can earn enough money to maintain his life. Recently he made a big sale, he has already spent almost ten dollars in the bar, so the bartender and the boss are very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the cheap, often small women who are hot to undress, there is almost no profit point for consumption. Ten dollars is no longer a small amount of money. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you say a newcomer?", William pointed at the glass of the woman who was dining on the stage, "How is she still?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bar whispered as he lowered his head and replied: "Tomorrow will come, today I will go to a field and I will not be able to walk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as a small bar. The hot and very unloved lady is actually foreign. Some people are responsible for this business. These people have about two in their hands. More than a dozen women who are prone to sweating, let them change the working place every once in a while, thus stimulating the bar's guests to constantly consume because of freshness. 20% of these consumptions are provided by the bar as a place to be sold. The security personnel who are sold to the bar and the four managers who have dealt with them can only get 30%. Of course, even if it is only 30%, it is not a small income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William asked the girl who told him before the bartender that it was said that it was only trained, only a little more than twenty years old. This is her second working place, which made the bar’s business in the recent period a lot better. A large group of old men are coming to have a drink every day in order to know if the new dancers are coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William squinted and shrugged his shoulders. He took a sip of fruit wine with a pronounced mouthwash and whispered on the bar: "Is there a recent What's the good news? Share it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bar stopped the work in his hand, looked at the sparse guests, and slaped a slap, "I have A message worth at least five dollars, if you want!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William thought for a while, reached out and shook hands with the bartender and reached an agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information is actually a commodity, not a physical commodity, since the commodity will naturally circulate, as well as other physical commodities, with the frequency of circulation Depreciation. And intelligence has a very bad place, that is, it has the ability to be reproducible and diffusive and timeliness. For the intelligence dealers without customers, the price of the five-dollar intelligence is too high, but for William, this is not a problem at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He changed his hand and his income was at least several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he learned the news from the mouth of the bartender, he quickly realized that the news was limited in sales, but he was sure to sell the price. He took out a wrinkled five-yuan denomination banknote and stuffed it into the bartender's hands to complete the deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of time, the sky gradually darkened, and the atmosphere in the bar was also lively. William continued to swim in the crowd with the glass, while collecting some Money intelligence, while selling information in their hands. In just two hours, he sold the five-dollar information for four yuan at a price of two dollars. Not only did the money earned back, but there was still a lot of income. Everyone has their own source and connections, he is selling intelligence, and the bartender is also selling intelligence, the same as every night before, without any unpleasant things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until... there are two uninvited guests in the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin and Dufoe ordered two cups of wine worth seventy-five cents. This wine is actually a high-alcohol blend of low-alcohol and then sold out. This is also a way for small bars to solve the problem of high alcohol sources. After Karur further increased the sales price of private wine through quota allocation, many small bars with weak strengths are implementing this method, and some small bars simply exchange water directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
