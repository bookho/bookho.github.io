			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the second trial, Kevin smiled and reached out to Camille. He won the prize and held key evidence and witnesses in his hands. In the end, whether Camille can find new evidence and witnesses to support his "murder on both sides" argument will not be Kevin's opponent, because all evidence and witnesses will never be more authoritarian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since you have already won, why not show your good education and have a good demeanor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winner is matched with the smile of the winner! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Kevin’s provocative actions, Camille squinted and his eyes were glaring at him. After a while, he went back and continued his movements, packed up the materials on the table, and finally grabbed them together and slammed on the table, making a loud noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The observers and jury members who have gone more than half have turned curiously, and in their eyes, the Kevin they saw was polite, even In the face of his "opponent", he also politely extended a representative hand. As a local prosecutor, Camille, rudely ignored Kaiwen’s goodwill, but made such a loud voice to express his dissatisfaction and hostility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original people are loyal to the position of the weak and challenged the powerful, representing Nasha’s acting girl, Kevin, who undoubtedly got people’s Good feelings, just as people have forgotten the vicious nicknames they once called Kevin a "devil's agent." Now they are more willing to stand on the side of Kevin against the rude district prosecutor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene also falls in the eyes of the judge. The judge smiled and shook his head and left the passage. From this scene, he has been able to rely on his rich experience to conclude that Camille will lose in the final review, and that the loss is difficult to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a psychic thing, but a judgment of experience. The more confident people, the more polite they are, because they have already identified themselves Won it. Those who were mad at the end, and finally lost to the other side, psychologically, Camille has lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge is still very optimistic about Camille, he is young, energetic, has a long-lasting desire to pursue the truth, and he is still a guy with a sense of justice. The moment the state prosecutor selected Kamil to be designated as a candidate, he was out of balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to make big news and lay his own position as a rider. He didn't expect to pay attention to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin looked at his right hand, shrugged his shoulders, turned and walked towards the gate with a brisk pace. Du Lin, who was sitting still, stood up at this time, behind Kevin, and went out together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to congratulate you, it seems that you have won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face Congratulations to Kevin is very happy, this case can not only make him squatting behind Camille, but through the final victory can also add a bright feat to his resume, not everyone can lose initiative In case, defeat the prosecutor. Of course, cheating is not counted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paved the way for his future trip to the capital, and he also got a thousand dollars, no more satisfying than this case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin’s emotions are directly on his face. “There is nothing to be proud of, even though I am really proud...” he said, stopping. Steps, raise your arms, and retract an inch of cuffs to reveal the wrist watch. "When I have a meal, you and me, just take this opportunity, I introduce two people to you."<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin as a lawyer who is victorious, inevitably has to deal with people of all kinds, from the tramp to the tycoon in the city, everyone can He provides important clues and is likely to be his client. The police who deal with the most, the police and their directors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of Tener, anyone can offend, but not the police chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the provisions and interpretations of the Imperial Law, the police have the power to briefly imprison the targets they think they can, and if they can find a little evidence, they can apply to the court. Arrest and search. In the past decade, at least three Tyrrhel tycoons have been ruined because they offended the police chief. Of course, such a past does not mean that the police chief is a sly villain. In fact, he is very intelligent. He is also very clear that not all tycoons are so easy to fall into his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, according to the experience and actual situation of the developed regions, the power of the police chief is not large, and is often regarded as the running dog of the tycoons. However, the city of Tener is a small city with borders, and the rough and barbaric style is obviously more prevalent here than obeying laws and civilizations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he carefully screened the objects and then killed one of them in the acquiescence of other tycoons. He will not choose those who can't move. Almost all tycoons have said that the police chief is a dog, and he has not seen him go crazy every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin’s invitation is very just right, and the outside has already killed the boiling sky, Du Lin naturally needs to find a thick thigh at this time to shelter him from the wind and rain. The Director of the Police Department is clearly one of the most powerful support at this stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sat in Kevin’s car. It was said that Du Lin had already made a name for Tener, but he didn’t even have a car. It was really shabby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunch is served in the best restaurant in the city of Tener, the Jasmine Magic Agate River. Jasmine is the name of the restaurant owner, a beautiful woman who is 30 years old and has a good charm. It is said that she is the mayor's lover, and some versions depict the story of some lively and fragrant, giving the workers a rich source of inspiration when they are active. But no one has ever dared to say it on the bright side, no matter whether it is true or not, it means offending people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real name of this restaurant is the fascinating Agate River. It is said that when the boat is on the upper reaches of the Agate River, the sun shines on the bottom of the river and reflects the light. A perfect fantasy picture like a fantasy. She thinks this is the most beautiful scenery she has ever seen, so this restaurant uses the name of the fascinating agate river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restaurant is located at the intersection of 12th Street and 11th Street, in the city center, opposite the city hall of the city of Tener, very high grade . There is no hall like other restaurants. From the beginning, there are staff who guide Kevin and Doolin and walk into the ninth box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people say that this is a hotbed of money trading, and some people say that this is a hatchery of corruption. In short, people who eat here do not have a certain power. The pursuit of wealth is that the family is not satisfied, and wants to master a little power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushing the door of the No. 9 box, the extravagant decoration gives a feeling of coming to the palace, vermilion, gold and fluorescent white It is always the main body here, and every detail reflects the pains of the designer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge table in the room, next to a set of sofas, three doors at the back of the sofa group, leading to two lounges, and a grooming room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting on the side of the table were two middle-aged people with a surprised look. One of them was slightly fat, and some of them were topped, white and tender. The other skin is slightly black in color, looks a bit like a provincial person, has a mustache on the lips, and the eyes are very sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Kevin walked in, he closed the door and dragged the jacket down and hung it on the hanger. "This is my very good friend, Du. Mr. Lin." Kevin first introduced Du Lin, so that the two men had some adjustments, and then Kevin introduced to Du Lin. "This big man is Mr. Gao Wen, the heroic hero. The veteran is now working as a director at the fire station."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Mr. Prando, the patron saint of our city, the criminal and the evil nemesis , the police chief!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took the initiative very humbly, bent over, his hands stretched out and the two gently gripped, simple After a few words, I returned to Kevin’s side. Kevin is a very credible person. He is also a well-known lawyer. He is a credible person. He said that when he introduces a big person to Doolin, he will definitely introduce the big man to Doolin. As for whether Du Lin has any way to climb these big guys, can he be a good friend with them, then it has nothing to do with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was less than a minute of calm in the slightly calm box, and Du Lin spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin looked at him with great interest, and the other two big men also looked at the kid with three points proudly, when Kevin did not introduce Du Lin When they are specific, they already understand that this is a kid who does not enter the stream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Prando, I’m going to go to the police station. I went to the Imperial Central Bank a few days ago and got a key, but I couldn't find the owner. I was going to go to the police station. I didn't expect to be able to see you here. It just happened to bother you and help him find the owner!", said Du Lin pulled out of his pocket. The piece looks like a silver key. The work of this key is a bit complicated, and the complex pattern is also carved on the key head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone with a little bit of knowledge can recognize the origin of this key at a glance - the opening key of the Imperial Central Bank personal safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the pride of Prando’s face disappeared, revealing a kind and friendly smile. He pointed to Du Lin and smiled and said: “Really A very great young man, keeping the most basic morality in such an impetuous society, this is very good. Since you entrusted me, I will accept it...", he stood up and walked around half a circle. In the hands of Du Lin who walked to his side, he took the key of the Imperial Central Bank’s personal vault and put it in his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
