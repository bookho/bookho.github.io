			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a very mature opinion about the 'illegal' problem you mentioned. How do we determine who is breaking the law and who is not breaking the law? You, Or do I go to 'identify'?", Du Lin added a tone on the two words, let these people understand what he said is the core, that is, who must stipulate what must be illegal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and said: "If I did a good thing and saved many people, but in terms of the definition of the law, my behavior is illegal, then How do I fight and how to argue? So the problem itself is contradictory, and the problem is back to the original point. In our cognition, those smugglers, I call them businessmen, their behavior is illegal, they are also criminals, The reason for all this is in the goods they transport and sell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If they are transporting food and selling food, we will call them smuggling Traffickers, and do they think they are guilty?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, no, then it’s not arguable that their actions are not illegal. It’s illegal to transport them. Something? Maybe it can be said, but this is not the right answer. If a commodity can increase taxes for a city, increase taxes for the entire empire, and give them 'legitimate' powers, let them accept regulation and System, then their behavior is still illegal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gentlemen, we have discussed so far, and have not found any one really illegal from this incident. It is not like a murderer, a murderer kills a person, he satisfies himself and takes away the lives of others. Unlike thieves, they steal other people’s property and cause others to suffer losses. These criminals and their Criminal behavior essentially satisfies oneself by hurting others, but smuggling doesn't hurt anyone. Go to the bar and go to the middle-class family to have a look, there are wines everywhere, they suffer from having these wines. "Is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who were they forced to buy these wines, and were they traumatized or even killed?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, sir, you can say that I am arguing for these smuggling businessmen, but I think I just did something that is good for the empire, good for the people, and I am willing to be Supervision from all walks of life, . & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp Paul I do not have any selfish "<br <br /> & nbsp />;"Thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rani took the lead and stood up. He crossed the table and walked over to Doolin. He shook hands with Doolin. "Your reply is very It’s very interesting and meaningful, it’s very important to inspire my thinking. Mr. Doolin, I am very grateful that you can participate in today’s reply. I hope that there will be a short time later, so that we can have a little chat about us. The topic of interest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also replied very politely: "No problem, Mr. Rani."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After personally sending Du Lin, Rani closed the door of the court, then looked at the other ten rulings and shrugged his shoulders. "We can vote next!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the vote were sent to Magus and Bowworth as quickly as possible, with a hearing record. After Magus seriously read it, he smiled and left the two documents aside. From now on, Harry is safe. The value of Dooling is that if he can complete this hearing perfectly, then Marques can intervene without using some means beyond the limits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very important thing, it’s like two adults watching their children beating together, before any of them’s parents The dispute only lasted between the two children. But as long as there is an adult on either side, the dispute will escalate immediately and become a battle between adults, and the problem will become more serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had planned to take the shot, but Du Lin had talked with him for a long time after visiting, and at this time he gave him a answer sheet that he was satisfied with. After Gus, he only needs to look at it quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the little tricks of Bowworth - for example, the problem of the Kings Court is simply not within his consideration. As long as he is the leader of the New Party one day, no one can move the position of the Xinshi Pavilion. Even if he retreats in the future, Harry can ensure that the power of the Sinister Court will not be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from the beginning, the little tricks of Bowworth were a joke for the old-fashioned Magus, who completely "misunderstood" the top What is the political struggle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that Bowworth’s fist is hit and he hasn’t built any merits and shrunk back, the next step is to see Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't beat you, I can't fight back yet? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Dulin this guy has entered the sight of Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin waited for a little while outside the court, and Rani smiled and walked out of the court. He reached out and invited them, except for the court. Rani's car went to a nearby cafe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cafe is well decorated, very quiet, the most important thing is that there are a lot of "boxes" here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time that Du Lin has seen this pure box in this world, like another box in the world. People here seem to be not very concerned about privacy when dining or drinking tea. Or they think they are educated and superior, they will not eavesdrop on other people's conversations, and others will not come to eavesdrop on their conversations. The truth is that people who really think so are either dead or have nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the restaurant near Imperial Avenue, the cafes are all separate boxes, completely soundproof, only those people will Come to spend, and don't spend as much money as money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two just sat down, Rani ordered a pot of coffee from the Federal Emerald Lake. Emerald Lake is a place name. It sounds like this name is very artistic. Breath, in fact, this place name also has a small story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emerald Lake itself is a stagnant lake, and the area is not large, when the Speakers of the Shangmeng developed a strong smell in the development of this area, and The lake has turned green, and there are countless algae and decaying lakes for a long time. Can't you say that it is called Stink Lake? So a speaker who liked art and collection proposed to call Emerald Lake. In the later opening, they introduced the river water of the Shudun River into the lake, and the stagnant water lake became a living lake. The smell was gone, but the green water was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emerald Lake's coffee is a bit different from coffee in other places because of its geographical advantages and long hours of sunshine. The color of coffee in Emerald Lake is faint. The blue color is invisible without careful observation. Only by seeing a little bit in the strong sunlight, and adding special flavor, the coffee of Emerald Lake has always been very popular, and it can be regarded as the local economic pillar industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the pot of coffee, Rani also ordered some other small snacks, these snacks are crowned with the name of "the palace secret", as to whether these snacks are made according to the recipe of the palace, that is another matter. At least they have a loud gimmick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just four snacks plus a pot of coffee, one hundred is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that Rani, the director of the Tax Administration, still has a little value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very interested in the economic construction and taxation you talked about. You know that the biggest problem facing the empire now is the lack of sufficient funds. It is no secret. "Lani's opening remarks are very transparent, and this is no secret." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taxation within the old party’s sphere of power is not up, and the tariff is still in the hands of the federal, which is equivalent to the entire empire’s tax system being beaten A sap, so there is an environment in which the capitalists and capital forces are inflated. The empire needs the capital of these capitalists for all aspects of development, and the capitalists urgently need money in exchange for higher social status and political status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides hit it off, causing the trouble that today’s capital has begun to intervene in politics and military affairs. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin’s proposed SAR and new economic growth points can incite the inner cycle of the heavy imperial economic system, then the empire can gradually get rid of the capitalist Relying on the power of capital, returning to the right track and entering a new cycle of health. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing doesn’t really have anything to do with Rani. At least it’s the things that the finance minister’s lords should care about, but everyone won’t dislike themselves. There is too much to do, so it is normal for Rani to have other ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of the new party in power is that here, officials are much more free than in the past, they can try to cross the border slightly and withstand the consequences of crossing the border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded, and Rani continued: "We can make a range of attempts to take the tax system of Otis from the empire's tax system. Stripped out and set up a new tax system designed to deal with the SAR's taxes, so that your achievements will be more obvious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
