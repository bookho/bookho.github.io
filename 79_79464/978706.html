			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps on the doorway outside the door made Andorran even more alarmed. He suddenly raised his shotgun at the door like a nervous person. gun. The exclamation of his son came from outside the door, which made him relieved and frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s me, my father, it’s me, can I come in now?", the eldest son’s heart turned back and glanced at a painting that was destroyed on the corridor wall. A few sharp pieces tore the picture frame, and the vibration made this thousands of pieces of painting a waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two kinds of shotgun bullets, one is the general bomb, and it is also the most mainstream bullet at present, including most of the firearms of the standard and non-standard types. General bomb. There is also a split-gun that requires a muzzle splitter at the muzzle. A special warhead will produce a slight vibration when passing through the splitter. This vibration is very small, but it is enough to split the bullet into six petals. This split-type bomb is mainly used for hunting and killing of large animals, as well as destructive killing at close range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The split-gun's range is not far, only 20 meters, but it is enough for use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andorra did not say anything, he listened carefully to the sound outside the door. After about a dozen seconds, he asked: "Only you alone?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am alone, what should we do now?", the eldest son constantly looks out the window at the end of the corridor, densely in the ear The gunshots have been reduced a lot, and there will be pauses for a few short seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not that the intruder has been repulsed, then there is only one other possibility, the last thing he wants to see – the mine protection team lost They are almost cleaned up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the entire camp was built, the camp was divided into three parts, one was the daily life area of ​​the slaves, and the other was the daily life area of ​​the employees and the ore sorting area. And the living area where the villa is located. In addition to the slave living quarters surrounded by high walls and barbed wire, the other two living areas are only half-height low fences. If the people in the mine protection team are defeated, this means that the intruders will come outside the villa in a few minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as an underground passage in the villa. At the time of construction, there was no consideration that it would be threatened. There are more than 200 people in the entire mining area, which is enough to suppress any behavior of the slaves. There is also a high wall outside the camp, which is enough to make Andorra feel very safe about his own safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no possibility to leave now. The only way seems to be to wait here for the fate of the judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Andorra’s “come in” sound came from the room, and the eldest son carefully opened the door and then stood tall outside with his hands raised. Make sure his father can see him and he walks inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Close the door!" Andorra moved his gun. His eldest son immediately closed the half-broken door again. He put down the shotgun and leaned on it. On one side, then greeted his eldest son and walked toward the showcase. "Come, take the handle, push the cabinet over, and the sofa..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two The individual almost pushed all the things that could be moved in the room to the door, and blocked the door tightly. There is still a period of embarrassment in their hearts. If the intruders can't get in, when the day is dawn, some people will find the anomaly here, they will call the police, then they will be saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very large number of people eating and drinking every day in the camp. Plus, the camp itself does not operate farming and animal husbandry, so every day the food will be sent. . Every morning at five in the morning, two carriages will send all the things from the camp all day. If they find it wrong, maybe the father and son can still be saved... Hope so! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you use a gun?" Andorra stuffed a shotgun into the eldest son and gave him a box of bombs, all that kind of Split bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eldest son nodded. He played with Andorra twice. Compared with Andorra’s passion for hunting, the eldest son prefers something more civilized. However, the situation is special. He inserted the bomber into the shotgun according to the action in memory, and opened the insurance. The father and the son looked at each other and sat in the corner of the room, staring quietly at the direction of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshots outside the house are getting less and less, and the intermittent gunshots seem to stop anytime, anywhere. I don’t know how long it took, the night has returned to tranquility, no more Any gunshots sound like the excitement of the past is a false illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any casualties?" Du Lin walked in from the door with a cigarette, and he saw a bandage on the arm of the Buddha. One sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dudu nodded. "There are seven dead people... and there are more than 30 injured. We are not familiar with the terrain here, they are black guns." Seven were destroyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is normal to have casualties in such a battle. Even if she is outside, she is responsible for covering the sniper. She can’t say that she can take care of all the places. In addition, many places have accumulated some ore, and the bounce is also caused. Part of the cause of casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s face was dignified and he went to the open space after the main entrance went in. The open space was full of dead bodies, one next to one, looking It makes people a little scalp and numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is everyone here?", all of them responded to Doolin’s question with a nod, and Du Lin frowned and shook his head. The staff and slaves of the mine came over and asked them to identify them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of Doolin, they caught a few who looked like staff. Guy and two slaves, let them identify the bodies of these mine guards and calculate whether there is any slippage. After several rounds of identification, three people were found to be absent. When Du Lin was preparing to order the entire non-slave living area, Ellis appeared with three people who missed the net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boss!", Ellis smiled and walked toward Doolin, and the three guards behind him had been disarmed, holding their ears and kneeling on the floor. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people also thought about going to fight at first, but the frequency of the crossfire that suddenly began to slow down made them feel bad. They are very aware of the habits of the mine. If the invaders are repelled, Andorra must scream all the slaves through the big horn and kill the invaders who are still dead in the face of slaves. To deter those slaves. These things have not happened, then there may be only one - the mine protection team is defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing they thought at this time was not to avenge Andorra or other colleagues. They used to be some gold diggers, and later gave up the dangerous life and joined the guardian. The mine team does not have any loyalty problems at all. It is purely to take money to work and eat. There is no need to be buried with Andorra. So they put Ellis and others out and handed over the weapons to surrender completely. Even the cow brain can guess why these intruders come, so surrender is the only way to save their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Ellis was in good condition, Du Lin sighed a sigh of relief. He went up and looked at it carefully, and let Alice turn a circle. "They didn't do it to you? What did you guarantee to them?", this sentence has two points, the latter sentence is the three surrenderers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellis had a little brainstorm before he reacted. "Of course not!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not wait for Du Lin to order, stepping forward The trigger of the pistol, the three guys fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have lost seven brothers this time, and the joy of victory cannot break away the pain that I lost from these brothers. I brought them out. But I can't bring them back alive. This is my fault!" Du Lin bounced the ash and took a sip. The cold wind in winter made him look a bit lonely. "The name of the brother who died will be engraved. All the church's heroic monuments will always be enshrined by us. Their families will have a pension of 30,000 yuan and will receive another 200 pieces of compensation every month to maintain their lives!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My promises will also be effective, their parents, starting today is my parents, their brothers and sisters, my brother and sister of Doolin, anything...", Doolin He slammed the cigarette butts on the ground, and the sputtered Mars was extinguished at the moment when he was lit at his feet. "If anything, just a phone call, I will do it for them. This is my commitment to them. It is also my right. Everyone's promise!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp; Those Guarts from other places, although excited, did not show anything, but the local Guars were somewhat shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the current imperial law, the maximum amount of compensation for death is 8,000, but in fact many times those workers die for whatever reason, at most It is possible to obtain compensation for four to five thousand to five or six thousand pieces, which is still a case of a lawsuit. If you do not pass the judiciary, purely private settlement, there may be only two or three thousand or even less. Dooling took out 30,000 pieces and gave each family 200 yuan a month to maintain their lives, and even promised to take care of these families of victims. This made many locals in the west breathe quickly. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this land they are used to killing and dying, and are used to struggle and failure. Human life is not worth the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words made them fully understand why some people would like to die for Doolin, or even regret it at all, fear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people even think that in a moment, even if they are dead now, at least the family can live a good life, and those brothers and sisters can finally fill out Full stomach, wearing warm clothes, do not need to be humiliated in exchange for a full meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
