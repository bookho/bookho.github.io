			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus asked Du Lin about this issue, and it was also the question that Du Lin intended to communicate with Magus. When a city is packaged and listed, it must comply with the current implementation of the stock securities law. After the successful listing, do investors and investors have the right to accept the supervision of investors and investors in accordance with the principles that other stocks need to abide by? If you accept supervision, will this supervision method cause problems in the construction of the city of Otis? If you do not accept supervision, how to ensure the interests of investors? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hull..., that is, the manager and Du Lin’s brief exchanges have raised many issues that need to be faced, some of which are very pertinent. It can be said that this guy is really thinking for himself. There are some things Du Lin can't decide. He is not the master of this empire. He can't completely make policies and regulations construct according to his own ideas, so he needs to communicate with Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you listen to your thoughts?", a lady sent a pot of tea and some pastries, from the lady's looks and temperament Absolutely not a general maid, plus the age of the lady, if there is no accident, it should be the wife of Magus. Maggs also had a very easy-going attitude towards her, and introduced her to her with a smile. "This is the young man I often talked about, Du Lin." He looked at Doolin. "This is me." Wife, Terry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood up immediately, with a very pure smile, slightly bent, "very fortunate to be able to foresee Your beautiful lady, good morning, Mrs. Taili.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telly laughed as she put the teapot, cup and pastry on the table Praising Du Lin, "My husband often talks about you in my ear and says that you are a very good mayor. I heard that Otis is particularly lively. When the weather is warmer, I will find time to pass. Look.", after she finished taking back the plate, "I am also very happy to meet you, Mr. Doolin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You talk, what needs to tell me ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mrs. Taili left, Du Lin sat back and was encouraged by Magus. Under the light, he picked up a piece of cake bite. How do you say this kind of pastry? It tastes a lot worse than Du Lin’s imagination. He thought that the cakes that Magus had to eat must be very delicious. But in addition to the rich honey fragrance, it is only sweet. taste. Of course, he wouldn’t say that it’s not good. It’s the truth that a fool can tell. He ate his noodles in his hands and nodded. “It’s very delicious. Can I bring some when I leave?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus stunned, then laughed. "Yes, I believe my wife really likes your request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having eaten a piece of pastry and drank A sip of tea, Du Lin summed up the idea and began to talk about the original idea that he first wanted to get the city "listed". "You should know that I have had a conversation with Mr. Rani, and you know the city of Otis. About 85 percent of the tax will be paid to the Imperial Tax Administration. In this case, the funds that the City Hall can retain will become quite small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This year we have paid a tax of 37 million, leaving about 559 million. In addition to the construction and maintenance of railway construction and urban infrastructure, the remaining funds will be spent. It is no longer possible to make the city continue to move forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And more and more capitalists gathered in the city of Otis, now they may still Did not reveal my own fangs, but I believe that one day these people Not meeting the current taxation methods of the city of Otis, nor will it satisfy their social status in the city. They will try their best to destroy the current construction and rules of the city of Otis. I have thought of many ways, but most of them are invalid. Because I can't accurately grasp whether my successor has the same governance philosophy and goals as me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once the successor has a problem, soon The capitalist will wave the banknotes and start to corrode everything that can be corroded. In the end, the city of Otis will no longer be the most important blood-forming organ of the empire, and will become a playground for the capitalists to make huge profits. So I thought of going public. Listing does have some drawbacks for the city, but at the same time you should be able to notice that it is the 'transparency' of listed companies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More The limited supervision of the people has promoted the transparency of the entire Audis system. No matter who attempts to find more benefits for themselves than others, there will be more investors and investors. We stared at him, then exposed him and punish him. He did not steal the interests of the city hall, not the interests of the empire, and the interests of the overall stock investors!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Du Lin said that when there was a flash of lightning in the mind of Magus, a thick black cloud was suddenly found. He suddenly understood what kind of ridiculous plan Du Lin took to promote a city packaged and listed. Imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it’s the power of supervision! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an Otis city's corporate report is very good-looking but there is a loss, then this must be a problematic company, he is stealing the interests of all investors. If the overall operation of the city is similar to last year, but the overall tax revenue is a lot less, it is a problem in the city hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation of the capitalist in the city of Otis was supervised by another group of capitalists. If he did something harmful to another group of capitalists, those people would definitely not Will choose silence. Using the power of capital to regulate capital and let the capitalists become enemies with each other is the purpose of Doolin's promotion. With these capitalists helping him to supervise the city of Otis, it will be the second stable firewall in the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus thought for a long time, he always felt that something was wrong, but could not say it. He first knew very clearly that the initiative of this matter was entirely in the hands of the Imperial Cabinet. It only needed the next decree to think that the listing of the city of Otis on the stock market was “illegal”. The reason for the past recognition was that it was “deceived”. Then you can take back all the dominance right away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this is a hooligan, but it works. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe because the dominance is firmly in the hands of the cabinet, Magus can’t find a place that he feels wrong, as if Doolin’s vision was very Correct, he even began to consider whether it was possible to refer to other SARs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Maggs took his divergent thinking back and raised a question, "We all know that stocks will rise because of some good news, too Will it fall because of some bad news, if the market of Otis is listed, the price will fluctuate, will it have any effect on the city? If someone maliciously manipulates the price to achieve some purpose that we do not know, How should we respond?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very serious issue. The rise and fall of stocks is directly related to the situation of the company. Conversely, it is because of the current survival of the company. The situation affects the price of the stock. If the city of Otis can maintain a healthy economic situation and positive economic growth, the performance of the city of Otis in the stock market will definitely not become a joke, only a myth. There is another situation in it, that is, will someone manipulate the stock price to get some benefits, such as spreading rumors and big bankers, and forcing the valuation not? Normal fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point Du Lin also considered, and also asked Hull, Hull’s answer seems to still linger in his ear, he told Hull’s answer to Magus, “If someone can manipulate more than 100 million Capital to short a stock, and this stock will continue to increase market value in a stable and fast way in the next decade, then the empire can consider whether someone is thinking about subverting the empire."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This huge amount of money will inevitably involve several consortia and more capitalists, and even federal people will intervene, otherwise they will not be able to get the money!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s answer is very positive. He got 50 million to go to the federal side to get the wind and rain. It seems that only a dozen people have made up the money. The money is like this. It's easy to get together. But what about the facts? Look at the people who are among these participants, except those big capitalists who don’t say that there are senior veterans like Magus, and they are the current leaders of the New Party. The bourgeoisie with the empire, the empire's largest economic empire central bank, has the largest money laundering dealer in the Western world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that these people can make up so much money does not mean that others can also get together. Those consortiums will not go bankrupt if they don’t want their own industry to break due to the break of capital flow. They are best placed to have sufficient funds in their hands to counter the risks of market irregularities. As for taking money out to sit in the village? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be a limit of three to five million to one thousand, and how many consortia can make this money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to make the money out of the money, use the money to make a short, will not fall into the abyss, and may even give them a head-on stock, is Are they too courageous, or are their brains rusty? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Further say...", Du Lin smiled slightly and lowered his head. "If it happens in this situation, it is a piece." Good things. The cabinet issued an announcement to allow the securities regulator and the central bank to investigate the funds at the same time. In cooperation with the operation of the city of Otis, the money will be swallowed in our stomach!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Magus nodded, and Du Lin considered it very well. Of course, there are still a lot of details to study, and in order to be able to go public in Doolin's Otis, at least some legal provisions need to be formulated and supplemented. The harvesting work behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks so, harvesting, from Du Lin’s thinking, the biggest insurance in Otis is not someone and an organization, it’s the empire itself, The government and ruling party of the empire. Since he already had such an idea, he was simply filling up his ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
