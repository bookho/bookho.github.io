			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood madly drove the car to the other side of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the small city of Turner, there are strict rules and scope in places that people can't see. The underground world of the entire city is dominated by two and a half gangs. The reason is two and a half, because the half gang has only half a breath. The half of the gangs have not been completely destroyed, but also the efforts of the big men to plan the structure of the city of Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor, the members of parliament, and the heads of the various departments, who are sitting in the light, have developed the gameplay of the entire city. Any "world" must be guaranteed to be as stable as possible when it is "competitive". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, the big men hope that the gangs and the forces will hate each other, and at the same time they need to restrain themselves, and further demand any business. A channel cannot be completely unified. Because these big men are also very clear, once there is a gang, or a force unifies the whole city, this is not a good thing for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because at that time, this unified power has the ability to challenge them. They don't want to see someone who can shake their position, and they don't want to be a loser, so they have developed the gameplay that is most beneficial to them and added to it. As long as there is any force and gang that has the momentum to "power the crowd," they will support the hostile forces of this power to counter them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big men always carefully control the balance of the whole city, perhaps this is not the best way, but this is the best way to fit the city of Tener. At least until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark layer of the whole city of Tener is divided into two large blocks and a small piece, the southwest part of the city and half of the city center, is the flame 骷髅"Tiger's site. The sale of smuggled contraband and the operation of community service centres with skilled women is the main business of Tiger. Of course, he occasionally visits and sells snakes, buys some girls from other places, or sells some girls to other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiger’s approach is very hot and hearty, but he has a characteristic. He strictly follows the rules of the game and never crosses the line. At the same time, it is also very generous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or like to squander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His opponents are not bad, used to use money as a means of greeting, so some people who dare to do anything for money and money are around him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other half of the city center and the entire Dongcheng District are the sites of the "Lizard Man" Codor. Under his hand, there are almost two hundred hands under the hand. The strength of the city is the strongest and the richest. He is a very clever "leader". When many people mentioned him, they felt that in the next five to ten years, he would change from a non-influenced gang leader to a tycoon in the city. One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost never runs an illegal business. His source of income mainly depends on some entertainment venues, such as bars, such as dance halls, such as some small theaters. He is very clever, this is the fact that everyone who mentions him has realized, except to sell some private wine in the bar, in addition to arranging some super-scale dances in the dance hall, in addition to performing some excessive stage plays in the small theater. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has never done anything else that is "illegal", of course, fighting and fighting, and letting some people disappear, it’s gang The main business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood is very familiar with him, and also through the trade of private liquor, in the hands of Codor, the operators of three different grades of bars, need a lot and have Low-cost private wine with enough profit margins, at this point, Wood can basically meet all the requirements of the company for private wine, so they are both business partners and a friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides this kind of thing, Wood’s first thought was to find Codor, and then, with years of relationship, spend another sum of money to make the song Dole took Du Lin's head off. At this time, he has already regretted it very much, knowing that he was almost exactly the same as Gothor ten years ago. There is still a step away from the tycoon. Under the hand, there are a large number of people of all kinds, even if those tycoons see him, they must take off their hats and say hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he took the step, in order to make himself more in line with the image of successful people in the upper class, he disbanded the former gang and placed many members in other local. He opened his beautiful suit and showed everyone that he was harmless and walked into the hall of the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, he regrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these years, in addition to money, and some insignificant prestige, he did not get more things at all. Those real big men looked down on him before, and now they look down on him. They don’t want to wear a suit, smeared wax, and don’t let some people lose their most precious things. In this city, he is not much different from the past. His sinful people still can't afford to sin, and those who dare not offend him are not guilty of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he lost his most important thing - representing his crazy axe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he suddenly woke up, perhaps this is the true intention of the rules of the game. When there is a person who transcends the boundaries, the rules will send him to another level and let him take the initiative to disarm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a confused state, the car rushed into the manor in the east of the city, and a group of hand-held weapons slammed into the car that had stopped. Drove Wood from the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon stood on the balcony on the second floor of the manor and looked at the wood that was pulled out, frowning. He recruited and asked Wood to bring Wood into the house and arranged a doctor for him. At the same time, he scattered a group of people and collected intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to know what it is that can make "Woodwood" so bad that it threatens the wounds of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Du Lin’s intelligence was placed at his desk. The city is basically no secret to him. As the leader of the largest and most powerful gang, he can mobilize many resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does anyone know this fellowship, and Dulin this guy?", he leaned on the sofa in the hall, his legs, shiny leather toe It reflects the soft glow of the gorgeous chandelier on the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the people in the hall remained silent, and there were a few Guars. The eyes of Codor were coming here. The flow of people back and forth, but they never say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A peeled body has reminded all the Guar people of their traditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
