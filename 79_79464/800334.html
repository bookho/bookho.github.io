			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like Mr. Bain’s thoughts on this traffic accident, this is just a traffic accident, there is nothing to buy and kill, just two The careless driver "study" in the suburbs accident. Of course, two lives were killed in this car accident, once again sounding the alarm for the car owners of Orodo, preferring to be slower and not to drive crazy by their own sex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bain felt that the car accident was very meaningful, and the death of the two victims was equally meaningful, because at least it allowed him to treat the incident as A typical case is used to promote public awareness of traffic safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner at night, Alin’s call from Du Lin was still picked up by the woman, but it was quickly transferred to Du Lin’s hands. Listening to the phrase "I am Du Lin" on the phone, Alisa had a bit of hesitation and was immediately filled with determination. She wanted Du Lin to tell her the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dave is you arranging death?" Alisa said that she couldn’t take it anymore after she went out. "How can you do this?" Do, that's a living life, and he doesn't know anything, you are a murder." She said in a threatening tone: "One day you will pay the price!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence in the receiver for a moment, only came to the calm voice of Doolin, the sound is like a quiet lake, there is no trace of embarrassment, "You call me to ask me this question? I I have thought about letting him shut up, but I haven't had time yet. I want to thank you for providing this news, at least it will leave me with tens of thousands of dollars to buy fierce money. By the way, I will go to jail!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really not what you did?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin completely heard the doubts in the words, He smiled at the "neuropathy" and then hung up the phone, letting the other end of the phone, Alisa, was a little crazy, but also relieved . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He changed his clothes after hanging up the phone, all the time on the construction site was dusty, after taking a bath, wearing loose clothes from the upstairs Down, he waved at Carter and let him follow his own into the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You sit down, do you want something to drink?", Du Lin picked up a bottle of wine, Carter shook his head, and Du Lin sat down and sat down at the table. In the back chair, his hands slid back and licked the wet hair. The neighboring brother, who seemed to be very kind, suddenly became sharp and sharp, and there seemed to be a sense of vertical and horizontal between the eyebrows. He smiled, but gave him an imposing manner! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the matter of the fellowship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter quickly sorted out the information in his mind and then told Du Lin one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Fowlers family disappeared after the death of Little Fowlers, which made a lot of sayings in the city, no matter how many kinds of sayings, in the first In the heart of some of the five districts of the Guartes, Carter’s ability to come back to live is Doolin’s credit. They also believe that Du Lin has forced the Old Forrests to live in the fifth district’s compatriots. The look is very good. The people who live at the bottom of society are most hoping not to have a lot of money or to have a good job. They hope that when they encounter unfair treatment, someone can stand up and help them to say a word, even to seek justice. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was Abbey so respected and welcomed before, because he did it, even though he deceived everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of Abigail will make some people worry about the future life, Du Lin happens to appear in time, let them find a psychological dependence. In fact, people are like this. When someone tries to rely on it once, he will think about the second and third times. This is a sense of dependence, and they pin their sense of dependence on Mr. 350,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter bought a piece of land and built a simple chapel. He didn’t know what type of "base" Dulin wanted him to build. So he built a church in accordance with the Guar tradition and received many members to join the fellowship. There are almost a hundred people so far. In fact, there are still many people who want to join, but the place is a little crowded, and Carter thinks that no one can come in. He needs to identify those good people and the bad ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous work Carter did a good job, which made Du Lin very satisfied, he couldn’t sit still, stood up and walked back and forth a few steps, sat down. On the sofa on Carter’s floor, “I got the liquor license from Juan’s central bank, and soon I will build the factory and produce it. These wines will not only be sold in Irian but also sold out.” He said that he paused a little and gave Carter a time to accept the information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this matter has nothing to do with what Carter is doing now, after waiting for a while, Du Lin continued: "You know, the second ban After the release, all regions were caught in the 'wine shortage', and the prices of both low-alcohol and private wines soared. I have an idea that the wine we produce is shipped to other places and sold at a lower price. Give our compatriots who are not happy with their lives and help them change their lives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is not an easy task, there are still many difficulties, I intend to give this to you, Carter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?" Carter suddenly stunned. "Sir, what should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't say he wouldn't do it, nor did he even make it look very troublesome. His work, his attitude is very correct. Dooling remembers that in the dream, there is a man who has done a great job for the first time. He never said that he can't do well, and he guarantees that he can complete the task every time. In fact, this guy has never done anything before, but he has confidence and determination, which is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said his thoughts to Carter, now the empire of the entire empire can be said to be the poorest of the lowest population, even Both the provincial sage and the northern barbarians are more affluent than the gualts. Changing the fate of a race is not a word. It can be done with a sum of money. It takes time and opportunity, and it requires fighting and sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I may be a very cruel person, I think so, others will comment on me like this!", Du Lin took a look at his mouth, After taking a bite, I took a sip and spit out. "Their life may be relatively bitter and poor, but at least their lives are quiet. And I have to break this silence and bring anger and death to the hands." They are going around, and they are far from peace..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter is also slightly excited, how does Du Lin say that he doesn't understand? He is the person in Du Lin’s mouth. He knows more about the environment in which he lives. His temples are rising high and his face is red. For the first time, he interrupted Doolin’s words. “Sir, you are wrong!”, His face was slightly distorted, as if recalling something terrible, and his tone became low and angry. "It's not quiet, it's not peace, sir, that's a humiliation!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without goals, no future, you are as alive as a soulless soul. Under the manipulation of wealthy people, living a painful life, even my daughter’s death, I can’t What did she do. Sir, can you feel my despair? My daughter is just like that. I have already bowed. They said that I don’t care about my daughter’s life. I only want money and I have no rebuttal.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do they know?! What can I do? What can I do besides bowing? Even if this is the case, they are only willing to give me two thousand pieces, they Shame me in jealousy I humiliate my dead daughter! But what can I do? I can't do anything, I can only hate my incompetence, hate those despicable people. I am timid, I am afraid of things, I finally understand, if there is no death, no blood No one has stood up and roared all the unfair pioneers, we are not saved!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
