			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Western Civil Mines Guard Corps Formation Act (Provisional) was enacted to address large-scale killings and vendettas more than a decade ago, often occurring overnight A vicious incident in which all of the mines in a mine died died. Because according to the law of the empire, when the "private property" has no heirs and inheritance organizations, it will re-distribute the ownership and belong to the state of "nothing". In the civilized world, real estate will become the auction item, the price is high, and the movable property, such as deposits and deposits in the bank, will be owned by the bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the West, it’s almost the same. When the owner of a mine does not have the power to deter other forces, the wicked people are like bloody sharks running from far away, just give them a chance, they will The mine was cleaned up and down, and then someone reported the case. After the local government found the case, it was detected and arranged for the re-auction of the mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, someone will stand up and buy the mine at a relatively low price and start to operate. No one will compete in the auction because This mine belongs to the first placard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a potential rule, a way of playing that cannot be made public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gangsters are doing this, and the capitalists are doing the same, often behind some mines being baptized, there will be some shadows of big capitalists, this is definitely not A business that ordinary people can run. Therefore, the empire will enact such a law to maximize the protection of investors in the western development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, protect "those people"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this law, according to the size of the mine, the number of people mined, the number of personnel in the mine protection team can range from 50 to 500. And can hold a modified standard weapon - rifle. These rifles have no automatic or semi-automatic ability to continuously fire, and must be fired a second time by hand. This "equipment level gap" is also created to prevent these rifles from harming the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The activities of extremist organizations have become increasingly rampant in recent years. If a large number of automatic shooting rifles flow into these people, it is definitely a disaster for the ruling party of the empire. . Some time ago...that is, at the end of last year, an extremist organization was preparing to launch a campaign to be captured by Imperial intelligence personnel. Although it had already attacked at the fastest speed, it ended up with a little trouble and hundreds of people died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mr. Luke, a friend that Du Lin had known before, he has a protection team of hundreds of people. These mine protection teams have almost become the nightmare of most miners, especially the slave miners who get through the sale of the population. Even if you die in the mine, it will be like nothing happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this is the second most profitable trade in the West, the population transaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mine needs miners, the salary of the miners is actually a little higher than people think, after all, there is a huge amount of mining in the mine without the support of significant safety equipment. The risk, so the miners' wages are almost forty a month or so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are also cheap miners who can meet their salary requirements for twenty dollars, but mine owners may need to hire a few more supervisors. Watching these people do not steal mines, especially gold, silver and gemstones, the ability of miners to steal ore is at its peak. Don't say that there are gold nuggets in the blink of an eye. They will even break the gold mine and then level it as much as possible, then hide it in the eyes. If you find miners whose eyes are always red and swollen, these nine or nine people are stealing gold from the mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in such an environment, those who have been smuggled from all over the world are quite fragrant. You only need tens of dollars or hundreds of dollars to buy a similar slave. You don't have to pay more for their salary, you don't need to prepare fresh food for them, you can beat and even kill them as long as they make mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no better ways for the three states in the west, but every place emphasizes a rule, that is, not allowed "Own people" are dead, not allowed to kill imperial citizens, as for those from other places..., try to keep them alive in humanitarian terms. After all, is life a thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the west, a sun that shines forever in the west, in the brightest places, with the darkest society! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of Doolin’s purchase of the mine is that in addition to the need to form his own mine protection team, the people here need to be assured. It is always difficult for an outsider to come to the area where he lives to say what he wants to do, and it will make people alert. But if this person invests and builds here, it will obviously gain more trust from people. Doolin’s plan was very simple, to gain trust, to take over the Progressive Party, and then to run for the governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only by firmly grasping the western world from the social, economic, and political circles, can we break through the shackles of time and upgrade our class within this empire as soon as possible, closer to that dazzling position! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time when he came down from the position of the mayor of Otis, in fact, Magus had already been on the night before the executive arrived in Otis. He passed the gas, and there are many reasons why Magus did not die at the party meeting. The main reason is their "hunting plan", which is to block the federal financial system and plunder the federal government. Over the years, I have mastered the economic achievements of the imperial tariff rights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a large plan, the federal government has suffered huge losses. It is impossible not to trace it. Once it is discovered that there are officials of the empire in the plan, it may be another The diplomatic storm may even trigger war. Therefore, Du Lin temporarily took off the layer of the official's body to make the implementation of the entire plan more secure, and the closing is more convenient. After the end of the hunting whale program, Magus promised that Du Lin would definitely arrange for him a position he would be very satisfied with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talling through the conversation with Magus, Dolin learned something, and guessed that this recall is very likely because Magus did not want to continue in the city. The long-governor-cabinet-prime minister ran wildly on this road, and he was very sensitive because he had already guessed part of the facts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Magus, Du Lin had to be vigilant and aware of him. The young man’s ability to create miracles was really amazing. The city of Otis, such a poor and backward city, has only been used for a year in his hands, and it has become a dreamlike appearance, and even became the most important money bag of the empire. With his ability and way of doing business, he is very likely to succeed when he runs for the governor three years later, which means that he is very likely to have become a member of the cabinet or a high-level party in the early 30s. Power and strength. It’s really that step, Magus or the new party leader may not be able to suppress him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A governor or party leader has sufficient qualifications to form an interest group with the same interests and political goals on his side, in complex interpersonal relationships In the context, there will be many people who will be able to steadily move forward to pave the way for Du Lin. Because Du Lin went forward, he would drive the vested vestiges around him as his core, and even if Du Lin didn't want to improve, these people would also carry him forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating as a high-ranking empire for ten years, Du Lin’s position to run for the party’s No. 1 position or even the prime minister’s position at the age of 38 to 40 years old has a certain possibility, with one in 10,000 possibilities. Calculate his success, then what? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In eight years, he was less than fifty years old after the expiration of his term of office, a person with great ambitions, dare to fight and dare to challenge authority and rules. Willing to let go of your career and power that has been in business for eight years? No, no, this kind of person will only continue to challenge, because he is not a nobleman. All the political legacy he has had will not be Fuze to his family and his descendants. He only has himself. If he loses, he will Nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it’s the day, this dangerous young man will launch a coup, just like the night of twenty years ago, in order to capture the highest of this empire Power, in the emperor to launch a coup that affects the entire empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not impossible. To Du Lin’s ambition and courage, he really dared to do this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a good deal with the Navy and formed the Imperial Army Club. Magus had to speculate on Doolin with the utmost maliciousness. Is he preparing for something? . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this time, Du Lin’s removal is of great significance. When the time comes, Magus intends to arrange a party’s work, away from power and The core of politics, like Powell, spent the rest of his life in a position that looks important but never shines. He will not touch the core power again, this is the arrangement for his future! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Magus still has a little regret. After all, Doolin’s personal ability is one of the best he has seen so far. In the age of Doolin, he is the only young man who feels amazing. He has not attended school, has not received systematic culture and education, but his ability and thoughts have definitely exceeded most people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus’s evaluation of Doolin is high. The higher the evaluation, the more he will be wary of Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also felt the caution and alert from Magus. Dulin, who was a little hesitant and hesitant, agreed with Magus’s thoughts decisively. , chose "Journey to retreat." He will not be at the mercy of anyone, which is why he chose the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
