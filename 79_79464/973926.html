			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Doolin came to the west?", the doorman put down the club in his hand, took the towel that the caddy handed over, wiped his face Sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a heating supply in the entire gymnasium. It is quite simple to increase the temperature of a house compared to the cold circulation system that is designed to cool the space. thing. Only a few crystals are needed to continuously release heat, and the entire space is kept at a considerable temperature through the air circulation system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stadium where the farmer is located is a closed gymnasium. The glass on the dome allows the sun to shine outside. The ground is covered with the south. Excellent turf, the life cycle is only seventy days, twenty square meters per square. The entire indoor gymnasium is almost 9000 square meters. It can be said that every two months it takes tens of thousands of dollars to sustain the turf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the original stadium was to give the capitalists a chance to play polo, or to do some other interior sports. After the Mennon came, it became a place where the doormen often appeared. Polo can't be beaten, but you can play polo without horses. This is a kind of "aristocratic movement" that has just emerged from the federal government, similar to the dream of Doolin. The golf in that world. There aren't many rules, and there are some differences in the details, but overall the goal of the game is to get the ball into the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After handing the club to the caddy, the doorman took off the wear-resistant gloves and walked to the side of the stands. The secretary who just returned the news immediately followed him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows Doolin, the pride of the Guartes, at least for now, everyone says so. Being a mayor of a city as a Guar is really not easy, and he is still young. The doorman wouldn't think that all of this was Dulin's efforts through his own efforts. There must be something big guys planning, and Du Lin was just the embarrassment he pushed to the front desk. Just like the recent accident, this cockroach has no value to use, so the big man behind Du Lin pushed a hand and took Du Lin back to its original shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the Mennon, the purpose of this behind-the-scenes big man is the city of Otis. After all, opening the casino in violation of imperial laws, selling contraband itself is very dangerous. thing. If the big man is working on his own, he will not touch the limit, but it will not be so much trouble for Du Lin to operate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a problem. It was Du Lin’s idea. He was destined to be unlucky and left all the faults for the big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No problem has succeeded, as it is now, Du Lin was kicked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if Du Lin lost his official position, he couldn’t be underestimated. After all, he had the most robust and smuggling network in the eastern part of the Empire. His private liquor was sold. Every place in the empire is very rich in itself and has a certain influence among the Guarts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer is not a Guart, he is a pure Ogilde, but he also recognizes Guart after the bloody dawn. People's fanaticism, so Du Lin's coming is not good news. The ghost knows what this kid will do in the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the stand and sit down in your seat, take a break for a while, drink a few cold drinks that cool naturally outside, after high-intensity exercise The excited body finally gradually calmed down. He thought about it and said to the secretary around him: "Let people warn him, don't mess around on my site. I welcome him to invest in the west, but he is not welcome to come and mess!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary was just about to do things, and the Mennon called him back. He was preparing to kidnap Alisa and her children, and then gave the 30 million gold that Du Lin swallowed. When I came out, I led Mr. Zema and Layton to let him live for a long time. He has been with the leader Mr. (Mr. Xmas) for several years. In the past few years, he has clearly realized that he is good at all, and don’t provoke the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a jerk, he does things entirely by his own preferences, whenever he feels that he is being humiliated when he pulls his gun, after he pulls the gun In most of the incidents, in fact, others just made a joke. If he directly warned Du Lin of the red fruit, would the Mr. leader feel that he was in the dark, and then mailed himself a black envelope and suddenly appeared in his room in the middle of the night? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hesitated a little, re-arguing: "I just forgot it, told Du Lin, conveyed my welcome to him to the west, tell him I invited him to talk to my house." This is the safest way. Until now, the doormen have not figured out who Du Lin and Nasha are the relatives of the leader--in the bloody dawn At that time, Mr. Rixma had been using a pseudonym, and rarely appeared in front of people in the true face. Only a few people knew his appearance, but did not know his family name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is today, many people who know Mr. Kemma can't guarantee that the surname of Kesma is the real surname of Mr. Kesma, maybe just a pseudonym? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the secretary left, several people who played with Mennon came over. These people didn’t seem to be wearing expensive clothes, but their temperament was absolutely Different from the average person, there is a calm, confident attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These people are the big capitalists of the state, and the “three guarantees policy” of the door farmers also benefited from cooperation with these big capitalists to be able to operate normally. I have absorbed a large number of followers to support him, so that he has the potential to run for the governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Mr. Mennon tired? Do you want to change places? Let's take a break?" The guy who talks is tall, strong but not bloated, his forehead There was a faint scar on it, but it did not destroy his appearance. Instead, he had a bit of toughness and hegemony in the elegant. This guy is called Carlos, one of the directors of the Imperial Bundika Arms Group and an executive director of Bondica West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bundica has many industries in the west, in addition to those oil fields, there are several large steel mills, and there are more than 20 iron ore mines. Copper mine. It can be the production base of the Bondika Arms Group. Carlos is not only a director but also a major member of the Bondika family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arms business is not good, especially when there is no national war, the market demand for arms is not high. Fortunately, there are wars on other continents from time to time. The outbreak has given the Bondika Arms Group enough market. There are some rumors that in these wars, Bondika and the other two arms groups played a very disgraceful role. They can be said that they promoted the outbreak of war, even hiring mercenaries to counterfeit local soldiers to take the initiative on the border. Rubbing and then detonating local wars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Carlos can be said to be a well-deserved "first person" in the west, rich in wealth, and a large group of escorts, able to launch a small-scale anytime, anywhere. fighting. He is also a very daring big man. In the door-to-door promotion of his "three guarantees" plan, he has contributed money. It is with the capitalists like Carlos and many Carlos that the policy of the doormen can be carried out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mennon nodded. "We have been exercising for almost an hour. It was a little tired. Secondly, my secretary told me that Du Lin came to the west. I asked the secretary to invite him to chat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
