			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s schedule is very regular. He doesn’t sing almost every night like Kevin. I can’t wait to wear clothes and women lie down together to discuss some Maybe he is already tired of the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin’s expansion is because he thinks he has touched the ceiling, and there is nothing on him that can suppress him. In the profession of lawyers, he It has become a benchmark and has become an example. It has reached the season of harvesting. So he inflated, he has no pursuit and ideals, no goals and motivation, he has done the best in this industry, can not find anything to remind him from time to time, to be modest and cautious, but also to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Du Lin is different. For Du Lin, his long march has just begun. His ceiling is far away from him. He is neither a governor nor a prime minister. It is not the party leader of a political party. He is just the mayor of a small city and has broken down with the governor. He still has a lot to do. Whether he is rejuvenating his own nation or changing his country through his own ideas, he has not done so, so he is far from being able to relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the luxurious executive suite, several people sat together around the grandson, and their suits looked like the elites of the upper class... Oh, no. They are, if they don't think about what they are saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been following Du Lin for the past few days, I found that it is not very good to start, Du Lin's life is too regular, we have a hard time finding opportunities.", It is the helper of the grandson who speaks. If he is a third-rate person in the entire Cape family, then his helpers, his cousin and his cousin, are the most marginal and invincible. They want to hug the grandson's thighs to gain an improvement in their family status or to gain a higher social status. In fact, everyone's starting point is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get more family shares, get more voice, and enjoy more wonderful life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy glanced at his grandson and continued: "And I noticed that someone around Du Lin has been protecting him, how many people don’t know, but today So far, I have changed my face eight times. I suspect that there are more people around him who have been quietly protecting him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep observation Three days were enough to find some problems. For example, there are always people around Doolin who are consistent with Doolin's pace. These people seem to be scattered among passers-by, but their route is always the same as Du Lin. When these people are close to the city hall, when Du Lin enters the town hall, they will suddenly disappear, and there is no uniform pace and rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin got off work from the City Hall, there were other inexplicable passers-by who suddenly appeared. When Du Lin went to work, they stayed around Doolin and kept a few meters to a dozen meters. Lin protects in the middle of their middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has very sound protection measures. What is more troublesome is that he does not drive or go out to enjoy work, like a monk. Two points and one line of life. It's hard to imagine that Dulin's young people can withstand such a boring life. Some people don't understand whether he regards boring life as enjoyment or whether he has some kind of power to force him to live such a boring life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;侄孙 scratched his head, the law of life is simple and concise to a certain extent, it is really difficult to start, can not drive the car directly into the pedestrians on the roadside? That is not a threat, but a terrorist attack. It may cause a sensation in the entire empire. In the end, it will definitely not be Solo, but he is a disadvantaged grandson. The harm of vengeful nature can be understood, but it is very bad to be involved in innocent people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any public events in the near future?" If you can't find a chance for a surprise, you can only take another approach. He heard that Doolin is the biggest smuggler on the East Coast, and it is okay to do some articles in this regard. Isn’t it a normal thing to have a vendetta between gangs? Just let him die.... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that there is another, more horrible idea in Sun’s heart. He is thinking about whether or not to directly kill the mayor who called himself “going out”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "going out" and the word "getting out" have no difference in spelling. The difference between their true meaning is that the person who said this sentence What tone is used. If you smile and say, it will definitely urge you to leave soon. When Sun Lin felt that Du Lin said this word to him, he certainly did not go out, but rolled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first person to trample on his dignity. He has encountered many people and things before, as long as he reports his last name, even if The other party is unwilling to compromise, and will keep him graceful and polite to ask him to leave, instead of letting him roll like a red fruit like Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should do something to restore his dignity and to cleanse the shame that the other party has imposed on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two days later, the voting stage of the general election officially ended. When the people on the emperor took the tube, he would give a short speech in the square of the town hall." The marginal man B, who did not enter the stream, said the information he had received. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;侄孙 nodded, and a chill in his eyes, "Then we will implement the second set of programs..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a promising dirty job, he always has a lot of plans to deal with all kinds of things, obviously he has already planned to solve Soro’s hand in the worst way. His mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grandson gave the new map of Otis to the edge of the crowd, and he spread the map on the table, all the rooms in the room. People are surrounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Sun took a pen and drew a circle on the square of the town hall, and then drew a bigger circle, "Generally speaking like this There will be no shortage of people to watch. This is a good opportunity for us. I am sure that there will be a lot of bodyguards present at the time, so we need to create something to divert their attention, and this is handed over to you. "Xiao Sun looked up at the edge of the A who did not enter the stream, and the latter nodded." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then...", he constantly draws some simple lines on the map and notes the time next to some lines, if their goal is only A small person, they don't need to be so cautious at all, just go straight and take out the gun and the thing is over. But this time their goal is to be the mayor of a city, they must make the plan look perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous discussion and deliberation, everyone put forward their own ideas and opinions, they have a lot of time, enough to let them find the most appropriate method, come "Warning" Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is always fast for people who work hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just got to the office and sat down for ten minutes. Defu reminded him to ask him to go out and give some speeches later. The recycling staff at the Imperial Capital has loaded the sealed cans filled with votes into the truck. Then Du Lin needs to say something on the square outside the city hall to thank some of the people who trust the new party and him during the voting process. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the election year, there will always be such a scene. Before the vote, after the vote, the politicians will constantly refresh their presence in the people. Feeling, politicians at this time are like the best of people's imagination, but it will not be long before they become another idiot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sorted out the clothes and walked out with empty hands. He didn't need a speech because he knew how to express himself and what they needed to listen to. He is not an incompetent politician, not the kind of mayor who needs a secretary to provide him with the agenda and what he should say, what to ask, whether to praise or oppose the mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, many people have gathered in the square outside the town hall, not only the locals of Otis, but also some places to look for business opportunities in Otis People, they looked at Du Lin from a huge pillar, and the noisy arguments in the square gradually quieted down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the usual practice, I should now thank the New Party, the new leader, Mr. Magus, and our Governor, Mr. Harry, and then I would like to thank you, let me say some more. If you can’t give up, you will be happy...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence in the entire square lasted less than three seconds as Du Lin’s sentence was not finished. There was a huge laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is wrong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, he did not make a mistake, "according to the convention" he said that this is the most appropriate, because it is not wrong. He thanked everyone, so everyone would not make him ugly, but he did not intend to say so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people like surprises, because surprises make them feel fresh and feel the joy they have never had before. Du Lin did it, only used half a sentence. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also smiled and continually nodded to greet the citizens in the square, even if some people who had just come from other places, they found that they seemed to like this young Mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice standing in the apron and looking at the square in the square, the young man of Alice is not the same as others, she is gnashing her teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that everything from Du Lin’s beginnings is no longer under control. I wanted to interview a big news – misinterpreting the conversation. She was not the first to do it. I didn't expect Du Lin to give her a chance. Then she thought she could pick up what she wanted from a young man's mouth and paid an expensive meal for it, and the result was played. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What annoyed her was that she couldn’t find a pawnshop here, so that she now needs to do odd jobs here to be able to get together. Ticket money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
