			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people... No, it should be four people. If you ignore Delil, who is sitting at another table, it is indeed three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dim sum shop, it should be opened after Du Lin left, the store is not small, there are many kinds of bread and desserts, when they come in the store There are four or five people in it who are shopping. To know this time, but at 3:30 in the afternoon, there are so many people away from the meal, indicating that the business here is good. On the first floor is the place where snacks and tea are sold, and on the second floor is the place where the guests who eat snacks are temporarily staying. There are eight small round tables, no one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin gave the clerk ten dollars and told him that he needed to borrow it for a while, and the clerk patted his chest to ensure that no one would come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sitting down, the Buddha felt that Mrs. Vivian had greeted Du Lin without taking off her eyes. She still looked down on herself and looked down on Doolin. If he just looks down on him, he can accept it. Anyway, he has been like this in his life. He wants him to become a famous rich man, or a politician with status, he can't do it. He knows how he is, he is suitable to watch him slowly rise up next to Doolin, help him do something he can, and then one day he feels enough, he will find a place to spend his old age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If possible, if not killed in the middle of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can allow others to look down on him, but he doesn’t allow others to look down on Doolin, even if this guy used to be someone he liked and was born for him. a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivian was silent for a moment, took off the big, exaggerated eyes, and then widened her eyes and looked at the Buddha, her voice was sharp. Asked: "Are you satisfied now? How about, good or bad? Is it what you want to see?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a bruise on her face The eyelids are also swollen. In particular, the left eye brow bone cracked a hole, and the blood had solidified into a dark red sputum. She was still squatting at the Buddha. She knew that she was a little unreasonable, but when she saw the anger in the eyes of the Buddha, her eyes moved to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not an easy task to go back and discuss with Peter this time, which is an important factor called “social responsibility of politicians”. Whether it is an empire, a federation, or elsewhere, family is always one of the most important “resources” for politicians. Many politicians often use their own families to do political shows, not because they can't find other materials, but because people love to eat them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emphasizing the family, emphasizing stability, and emphasizing family and children are a very correct political line that is extremely effective for politicians of all levels. Throughout the New Party’s administration, no matter which party’s middle- and high-level politicians are married, they are all married. Divorce and singleness are absolutely wrong behaviors. So when Mrs. Vivian asked for a divorce, Peter was really angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a man, Vivienne is a woman, and when they divorce, no matter what the real situation is, people will think that the woman is definitely on the weak side. And he will be killed. It may soon breed a lot of rumors that he does not want to hear, and even question his ability. Even a family of three people can't handle things well. How can they handle a city or even a state? thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remarried, his political opponents and those who love to watch the fun will say, hey, he and Mrs. Vivian are divorced to marry this woman. But if he is not married, his situation will become a means for the New Party’s political opponents to strike him during his campaign. A person who has no family, how can a person who is not willing to bear even the most basic responsibility? More important responsibility? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Mrs. Vivian’s request is a huge injury to him. It is not the guilty feeling that hurts, but the political life that hurts him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter in anger once again couldn’t control his reason, he slammed Mrs. Vivian’s meal and warned her if she had this again Kind of thoughts, send her to hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a threat, it is a threat to the red fruit, because he can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other things will not be in his eyes than political life. And a year has passed, and the Governor has grown a lot. Who knows how long he can last? Maybe it will die in a few days. When the Governor is dead, what else does Vivienne have? She has nothing, and it is impossible for her to get rid of any waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He played?", the Buddha’s unpleasant emotions have just subsided, and it seems to be very calm, with his head down from his pocket. A cigarette, Du Lin knows this guy. The more he behaves like a normal person, that is, the more abnormal he is, the only normal one is when he is joking with a hippie smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivian was not talking, her eyes were a little red, and she rubbed her eyes and put on the sunglasses again. I don't know why, when she was beaten by Peter, she didn't scream, crying and reluctantly, and suddenly collapsed when facing the Buddha. Suddenly she felt a grievance, she did not understand why the Buddha's words, the three words and two words will have such magic, she can only hardly stand now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly nodded. "We have some contradictions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I heard that you are going to divorce this time, is it for this matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivian turned her head and sat in the corner to sneak Delier, who took the flower tea, Delil waved a smile and waved like a water snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha looked at the cigarette in his hand. After a while, he played the ash and looked at Du Lin, "Boss, help me!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was a little surprised. He looked at the Buddha and confirmed that this guy was coming to the real, and then looked at Vivian. "Madam, you may not know, This is the first time that Buddha has asked me to do something for him. He never asked me to do anything before." Then he sighed. "If someone else speaks, I can refuse it. I can't do this alone. Please forgive my recklessness and preoccupation, madam, do you want Mr. Peter to return to the embrace of God, or let him be ruined?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;薇Mrs. Wei An took off her sunglasses again. To tell the truth, when the Buddha asked Du Lin to help him, Mrs. Vivian’s heart was still touched. After all, the two people haven't seen each other for so long, and there have been unpleasant situations before. But what is the answer to Doolin? The two words of Dooling in Mrs. Vivian's heart are like seeing the father of a young age, as if he can help others, it is a great honor for others, plus an understatement to send a city to the city. Going to see God, what have these two guys been doing for more than a year? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha looked at Mrs. Vivian, and whispered, "You decide!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mrs. Vivian was so angry that she rubbed her eyes hard and then pressed her hands on the forehead. "I calm down, Peter is the mayor!" Dulin nodded. "And then you said to solve him." "Duo Lin nodded again, and Mrs. Vivian said with a smile. "Sorry, I can't hold back, what should I do after I solve it? Are you going to flee?" She waved her hand. "Your kindness." I already understand, but let me do this, okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her emotions have gradually returned to normal. Some people say that time and distance are the most poisonous poisons, even lovers who are sworn by each other under the moon will be separated. But some people say that this is a good medicine, able to accumulate feelings until a complete outbreak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You believe me!", Du Lin leaned back, tilted his legs, and folded his hands on the armrests. "No matter which one you choose." The plan, I can let him quietly solve it without any trouble. As for the escape you said?", he smiled a little. "Maybe, after all, we have to go a long way!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously a joke, but Mrs. Vivienne feels the self-confidence from Du Lin’s body, and an imposing manner, one does not Peter’s momentum in his eyes is like saying an ordinary passerby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three were silent for a moment, and Mrs. Vivian said: "I just want a divorce!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Although Peter lied to her feelings, although they have not had the kind of family life in these years, after all, the "neighbors" who have been doing so for many years, there is always a feeling that it is difficult to start. She can accept Peter's return to the embrace of God without knowing it, but she knows that she can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is always a woman, no matter how loud she slogans of affirmation, no matter what she has done, as long as she has not crossed the threshold, To become a politician who uses politics as her lifelong pursuit and life, she cannot be completely ruthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mrs. Vivian chose to let Peter have an accident or a ruin, Du Lin could find a way to solve this problem, but she only wanted a divorce... ...this is a bit difficult to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, Du Lin said with a joke: "It’s better to choose to kill him. I think it’s simple." He said he laughed. "I will try it first. If not, we will change the other way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next lady’s attention is in Doolin and Dufo What did she do for more than a year? When she knew what Du Lin’s current price was and what he was going to do, he was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that Peter sent his face to prison in ruthlessness more than a year ago, just to test the attitude of the Guarte Chamber of Commerce. But after more than a year, no matter how backward and how poor the city Dulin is going to go, he is the mayor of a city, the same mayor as Peter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
