			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin has no money, boss!", Luke’s financial adviser arrived at Irian with the fastest team and half of the team, and passed Some of the documents and property submitted by Dooling analyzed the conclusion. "In addition to more than 30 cinemas in his hands, he has about two million in cash on the company's account, and the total amount will not exceed five hundred. 10,000. Based on some of the information and data you provided, I think he has invested the rest of the money in the construction of the 8th district. In the short term, he will not be able to draw more money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luke brows a little, the glass in his hand is squeaky by him, he feels that he has been cheated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Southern Film Company’s shareholding is equally divided, Luke and Doolin each have a 50% stake, but the problem is this distribution It is unreasonable, he should occupy 55 to 60 percent. In fact, Luke knew very well that the gap in this fund of more than one million was equal to that Du Lin sold a ticket to him and gave him the opportunity to enter the game with everyone. However, Luke’s guy has a tendency to turn his face and not recognize people. His first thought is to get back ten percent of Du Lin’s hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 10%? Not much, really not much, but with this 10%, Luke has mastered the fate of this company. With the advantage of absolute controlling power, he will inevitably press Du Lin in the negotiation of cooperation, and even press Hu An to become the biggest winner. Thinking of it, he put the cup down and wondered: "Is there any way for him to spit out 10% of his take?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wealth consultant The legal counsel who came together put a pen in the middle of the agreement page and raised his head and looked at Luke. "I am afraid that you will be disappointed with the boss. The agreement itself is not a problem. The problem exists here. It’s not an agreement on equity allocation, but an acquisition agreement!” The lawyer pinched his nose. He knew Luke very well and knew that he couldn’t understand some professional things, so he used the language as much as possible. Explain the content of this agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised the agreement in his hand and said: "In addition to a bunch of meaningless nonsense, the core content is only two points. The first point is Southern Film Company traded its Oriental Star Entertainment Company and all its rights from Du Lin with a 50% stake. Second, Southern Film Company must build at least 60 in the coming year. Cinema, otherwise you will default, Du Lin has the right to request a withdrawal in accordance with the market value of the Southern Film Company, and you must undertake this part of the equity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Luke’s silence for a long while, he asked, “I’m agreeing with the latter one, but what’s wrong with the previous one?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer will agree Turning to the attached page, I found a page of documents in front of Luke. "The value of the Eastern Star Entertainment Company’s value assessment report indicates a total value of 6.5 million yuan, which means if you ask for it. The market value to redistribute equity, your equity will only be less than Mr. Doolin, no more than him! More importantly, this 50% of the shares are not allocated according to your and Mr. Doolin’s share investment in the company. Instead, you used this fifty percent from Du Lin’s hand!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke’s face is even worse, not because he feels Du Lin pitted him, but he couldn't understand what the lawyer was saying. "Why is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer almost laughed, saying So I understand that Luke has not understood that he can only continue to be patient with the explanation. "He sold things to you. That is your thing. In strict sense, it has nothing to do with him, but he owns 50% of the company's shares. According to the second core content I just said, if you can't build 60 years in a year. At home theater, he will have the right to withdraw shares, and you may have to pay about 6 million to 7 million in cash for this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer smiled and shakes I shook my head. "I looked at you and Mr. Doolin's plan. To put it simply, I intend to reach a cooperation with the George family through the number of theaters in your hands. Now Mr. Doolin has passed all the pressures on. If you have a successful cooperation, he will get the same benefits as you. If the cooperation fails...", the lawyer couldn’t bear to continue to attack this no-high-rising nouveau riche, and his eyes showed a touch of faintness. Pity, "All losses will be borne by you alone, and Mr. Doolin will not only lose money, but will be able to make a leave!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke punches Kneeling on the table, a few It’s coming out, “Why is this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Luke’s outbreak lawyers to take it easy, he grinned, “because the core is the second!” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, the agreement was signed for a whole year, which is what Du Lin and Luke said, but the problem is that the delegation will return to Yili at the end of the month. Ann, up to a month to determine whether cooperation, how to cooperate and the distribution of benefits. If everything is going well, then Du Lin will enjoy the benefits enjoyed by Southern Film Company and one of the largest equity holders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it fails... then will Luke still build 60 theaters with eight million in his hand if he has failed? This is obviously impossible, and it is really stupid to be home. But if Luke did not build 60 theaters in accordance with the agreement, Du Lin had the right to return 50% of the shares to Juan, and then took about six million of cash from him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with this agreement, no matter what the outcome is, at least Doolin can stand in the perspective of the winner and does not need to be ignorant of the negotiations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually a very simple contract "scam", but it can't be said to be a scam, because every step is legal, causing this The situation arises because Luke can't wait to "go on board." If he can wait for a few days to wait for his lawyer, maybe the situation will not be like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, Du Lin sold his company to Luke, the way to trade is 50% of the shares in the South, but this one In addition to his interests in equity and shareholders, Du Lin and the company have no relationship with the company. He is not a partner of Luke at all. He is like an investor. If the situation is good, he will follow suit. If the situation is not good, he will directly use the equity to exchange money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Luke can wait until his lawyer comes to Irian to make a decision, the lawyer will definitely propose that he can establish a new company, but can’t “make” Dulin’s The company should tie Luke and Doolin firmly together in a cross-shareholding manner. It is good for everyone to share, and lose everyone together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I knew that he was not so kind!", Luke stood up in madness and walked around the room with anger. Seeing nothing is pleasing to the eye. He kicked the sofa on the sofa, moved the sofa to the position, and made an unpleasant rubbing sound. "I know, I know! He gave me these good things and I definitely made this plan." He dug a pit and pushed me down. This despicable villain looks like everything is good for me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"贱人!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"贱人!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer can only silently pack everything on the table Although Du Lin’s trick is not very common, it is not new, but it can always fool some fools. Regardless of the final result, Du Lin can guarantee that at least two million profits will be earned in this transaction. This is really a smart person, that is, I don't know if someone is going to make a move for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
