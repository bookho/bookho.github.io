			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, these are not the key points, what Irving is doing, what Albert is doing is not the focus, the point is that they are too invested in acting, so that they forget I have my own face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are a group of actors, a group of worthless actors, Du Lin spent a lot of money to package them into the federal "superstars", they actually thought I am the one I played, and even extended other ideas on this basis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin is just a director, he may like the two actors very much, because any true performance will give the audience a more perfect viewing experience. But these two bastards are simply not outstanding young entrepreneurs, the president of the consortium, they are actors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are too deep into the play, which is dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert’s series of mistakes is caused by his deep play, no matter what wealth, power, and social status he has now, Yourself. He tasted the sweetness of these things and forgot his true self, so he made the wrong decision. When he called Du Lin "Mr. Doolin," Du Lin knew that this guy had something to think about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has lost the fear of Doolin because he is now a celebrity, a member of the federal government, and the head of the consortium. There are many people who change their stance because of his attitude. Many families are counting on him to make a living. He has become a brand new master and dominates the fate of many people. He is no longer the thing that needs to be promoted every day in the morning, and the big bag needs to be promoted. He appears on the Dawn Avenue at 6:30 on time and waits for the salesman to recommend the product to Doolin. The customer’s whimsical thoughts, the little people who are so busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he is the big man, he is the core of the universe, and everyone is around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person begins to enjoy all of this, let him return to his past life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like developed science and technology for two legs amputated patients with two flexible legs, better mechanical legs than natural legs, can I don't know how to run without fear of running, jumping, and letting him enjoy the fun of chasing the wind. Suddenly, some people said that they should take these legs away, then his first reaction was to resist, and to try to make these legs forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich who have not experienced poverty have never known the pain of buying a piece of furniture and the whole family to discuss. Albert does not want to go back to the past. He did nothing wrong, but he did it wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All he has now is not his, Du Lin temporarily loaned him, since he can lend him, it will be able to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do to make up for this?", Albert became frustrated, he squinted and looked as if crying, but Du Lin Do not eat this set. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood up and shook his head. He walked around the table and pressed it on Albert’s shoulder. "Have a good rest for a while, then cheer up. This I will arrange someone to take your job for a while, and there will be things you need to do later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is like a scorpio, Arber He immediately looked up at Du Lin and choked. "Thank you, Mr. Doolin, thank you for your kindness and forgiveness, I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin patted him on the shoulder again. "Have a good rest. You will stay here during this time. After all the things are over, let's go home together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After that, Du Lin left the house with people, leaving some people here, and Albert was under house arrest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin and Dufoe left alone after the team entered the city. They used the secret passage this time. There are many people outside his manor. Staring, he can't have more contact with Albert under the gaze of these people, it is very dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This federal trip does not allow for any mistakes, otherwise it will leave you here forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Striking a country’s finances is definitely not an ordinary crime. He is likely to sit down and finally put the ashes in prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the Atlantic Group’s senior executives issued a notice, Mr. Albert’s daily work due to illness, the daily work of the group company will be by another company’s board of directors The director is temporarily responsible, and Mr. Albert will re-chair the consortium after he is ill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
