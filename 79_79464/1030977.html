			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days is enough to happen a lot of time, three days and nights, three sleeps and waking, and three freshly baked newspapers. It is very strange that there is no big news in the newspaper about the news that the Freedom Front has been annihilated. Even if there are no reports that are overwhelming, it seems strange. However, those who quickly cared about this news found the reason for self-convincing. It may be because the cabinet did not want to cover up the content that should not be exposed, and it was well known, so everyone was safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a little bit pity that such a record should be reported with great emphasis on letting people know the imperial army’s prestige and terrible fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things they hoped for were realized on the fourth day, but no one is happy because this news is very terrible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want their lives to be the innocent kings. These reporters use the same photos with different texts to describe the two opposite contents, and they should become heroes in a flash. The things of the medals became weapons to kill them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headline of the Imperial Daily, a photo of the enlarged print occupies the entire newspaper, which is a photo taken on the hillside, almost the entire valley Filled with a face and a twisted body, it is even more chilling. The bodies of these bodies are also numbered, just like the animals in the slaughterhouse, fill in some numbers on an egg-sized sign. Then use a special machine to pierce the ears of cattle or sheep and let them have their own "identity." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are the same, they are lying on the ground as quietly as slaughtered animals, all of them are bloody and fuzzy, and they can smell through the newspapers. To a strong bloody smell, and cold and cruel humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of the original headline was transferred to the second edition, the first time since the release of the Emperor Daily, and the title "The Truth" also adopted a bright red color. The next article began to reveal the identity of these people, people are still shocked by the content of the photo to the body trembling, the next words make them feel an unspeakable anger, and sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because these people are slaves, they live in the mines in the west, live a dark life, and eat less than the feed of animals, many people Because of heavy physical labor and poor living conditions, they were then thrown into abandoned mines to wait for death. In the west, there is a world of death that ordinary people can't imagine. Every minute, slaves die every day. Their death will not alarm anyone, except for the hard labor of being slaves like them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miners headed by the West Mine will buy cheap labor from the traffickers by purchasing them and then use them excessively until they die and then replace them with new ones. It is a lawless world. It is a world that has never been respected. The mine guards under the mines have been given the power to kill and kill. They let their emotions dominate their behavior, killing or smothering those who are willing to kill them. No one will judge them, because these slaves simply do not exist in people's minds. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, some slaves got rid of them. They were released by a kind-hearted mine owner. They didn’t go home, but instead they plunged into the great cause of liberating slaves. They were crowned by these mine owners and capitalists in the name of extremist organizations and killed them madly. What was shown in the photo was a massacre that occurred four days ago. A group of rescued slaves lived in the valley, but their existence has interfered with some people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the mine owners in the west, the capitalists, and the traffickers, so they got together to find ways to get rid of these slaves, and they really did . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a bloody cruel massacre to cover up the chain of interests in the dark world of the West, distorting the truth for the mad and power of money and power, and yearning for freedom Those who were unwilling to become slaves became militants and then incited the Imperial Army to have a massacre against them. Their wish was fulfilled. If a slave who did not want to be named did not provide such content and information to the newspaper after fleeing the valley, people may still be immersed in the cheers of the annihilation of the militants! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fooled, just as every time we are hurt, our kindness is deceived by disgusting vested interests. Today, they can reverse black and white to describe a group of slaves as dangerous militants. Then, when we stand in the sun and hold high flags to fight for our power, will this happen, they will turn us into bad people, Then let another group of people destroy us? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the greatest ridicule of freedom. This is the biggest defilement of public opinion. This is the retrogression of history and the ugliest scandal ever! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those who have read this newspaper have produced a lot of emotions, as the newspaper said, they are still in the west a few days ago. The news came to the excitement, and the wicked extremist militants finally finished. Now, the newspaper slaps them a slap in the face, hitting their cheeks hot, leaving them with nowhere. They were so happy and cheered for the execution of the executioner, but they made a group of innocent people a victim. This is the biggest deception, and they are hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social activists that have swarmed in a flash have appeared in various parks, corners, and places where people gather. They let more people know about it through powerful speeches, and some things behind it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Mining Association, was pushed to the cusp by public opinion for a time, people believe that this Western Mining Development Committee knows all the insider and plans all actions. Because all members of this organization are mine owners in the west, they are slave owners, and only these slave owners will worry about the losses that slaves have exposed to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day when this matter was just beginning to work, a western mine owner called Federer stood up and stood in front of all the media. He claimed to hold a press conference three days later to give a detailed introduction to all the inside story of the West. The entire empire, including the federal and some small countries around the country, began to leave the west. This conference will probably change the existing pattern in the west and shake the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, the West Mine will be finished." Du Lin threw today's Western Daily newspaper on the table and looked at Henry sitting across from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry’s face is a bit strange. He kept looking at Du Lin with his head down. After a while, he said: The person who annihilated the Freedom Front is a friend of my father. Now his situation is very passive. Some people in the Ministry of Defense say that he has close ties with the western capitalists." When it comes to this, Henry can’t talk about hating Du Lin. But to say thank you, he certainly does not exist. "My father called me at midnight last night. He asked me to give him an explanation, but I really couldn’t think of how to convince him to make sure that it was not wrong. Indeed, the trade in the west began to recover after the Freedom Front was annihilated, which led many to recognize the goal of first annihilating the Freedom Front to restore stability in the West. . But then the reversal of public opinion allowed these people at the core of politics to follow the paradox and began to reverse. They believed that the person who proposed the plan had a certain degree of relationship with the Western Mining Association and the capitalists in the west, in order to cover up the existence of slaves in the west. Such a horrific news launched a massacre of the Freedom Front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the original plan, we must first ensure the stability of all cities in the west, find the behind-the-scenes blacks who launched several attacks, and then annihilate the free fronts that may be difficult. . According to the normal rules, once the plan is formulated, it is not allowed to change the plan at will without any need to change the plan. Because the Ministry of Defense is planning, if the Ministry of Defense continues to change the plan, it will only allow the grassroots military region to feel the change and incompetence of the Ministry of Defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
