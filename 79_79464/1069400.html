			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk on the steps of the Theatre of Villier, there are many people around, it seems to come to watch the show, Du Lin asked very curiously "Why don't they go to a little developed place in the south? Shouldn't they make any money in the West?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin knows a lot about everything. There is not enough understanding of the insider of the "entertainment industry". Whether it is the big man in his dream or his own, he feels that there is nothing in the entertainment circle that he needs to pay attention to. Many people use the fame and fortune to describe the entertainment circle and describe the society inside. People think that it is glamorous and colorful, and all the things are so beautiful. But in fact, for the real big man, the so-called fame circle, entertainment, or at best, is an adult goods vending machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name? Lee? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a low-level joke. Whether it’s social status, wealth, popularity, or influence, actors are never better than real big capitalists. It’s a kindergarten! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry obviously wants to know much more than Dooling’s “ignorance” in this respect. He is more like a child of a wealthy family in the traditional sense. Put more attention on how to eat, drink and have fun. From the moment he was born, in addition to worrying about his IQ, he did not need to worry about any livelihood issues, even if his IQ was not up to standard, he also had a career in the West. Many people feel unbalanced, which is unfair, but these people ignore themselves, or everyone is unproductive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200 million brothers and sisters participated in a marathon race, why can you win alone, why are those brothers and sisters who are only one step slower than you? Will you sink into the endless abyss and never see the sun again? This may also be unfair, but it is the greatest fairness. As an indirect hand, 200 million brothers and sisters came to us in this world. From the moment of birth, it means that an extraordinary life has come to this competition. In the world, what we have to do is to fight the whole fierce battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the West earns less than anywhere else!" Henry confuses Du Lin while walking. "The City Hall wants to make the citizens enjoy more." High-quality entertainment content, they saved the cost of renting the opera house by Quin Opera, they have no cost except the fare. Then there is the fare, one ticket for fifteen, and the Van Lier Opera has eight hundred. One seat, one is one thousand two hundred. They will open six performances here for three consecutive days, which is seven thousand two hundred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you think that an actor can perform well with a little flower basket or something else, or even invite them to dinner, I don't know how much income this part has, but it is definitely not too small, there are tens of thousands! There is no difference between performances in other places, or even because of the wealthy people in the west, so that their income is higher!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West through so many After the turmoil, there have been many institutional rules that have changed unconsciously. For example, more mine owners are now willing to live in the city, and the destructive power caused by the existence of the Freedom Front has continued to this day. The three mines were slaughtered and caused a great shadow to the mine owners. They are reluctant to stay in the mining area compared to a safer and more reliable city. Now, even the slaves are gone, and the number of mine protection teams is also Cut a lot, everything is on track, and they don't need to do anything to stabilize their authority in the mining area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of mine owners will choose to live in developed cities, such as Vanlier, which is not only the capital of a state, but also the most developed city in the west. one. In the past few years, the Mennon did not bring positive changes to the west. At least in the construction of the city, he made great efforts to make some cities gradually emerge from the 22 cities and stand out from the cities. As the core, we have created an economic circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Vanlier, there are dozens or more of mine owners, as well as tycoons from all walks of life, this is definitely not a poor city. Have a terrible spending power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two entered the Grand Theatre after checking the ticket, found their position and sat down. Before the show started, the light of the entire theater was closed, huge The space was dark in a moment, and Doolin heard the exclamation of someone who was so scared. Before the official start of the performance, the light is usually dimmed. The purpose is to highlight the effect of the stage and the actors on the stage. There is not much light to completely turn off the light, but it cannot be said no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a cave, there is also a poor fellow who is in the dark, her name is Catalina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is locked in the dungeon, the dungeon is a terrible place. In the past many years, many warriors can’t suppress the words from the heart. Deep fear, they even choose to commit suicide and are not willing to be locked in the dungeon. Dungeons are different from other places of detention, and prisoners spend almost all their time in the water. The prisoner will be put into a large cage, and then the prison cage will sink into the water, only a small space will be allowed to make the head float on the water, and some will be more downward, so that people can only lean on it. Face breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no chance of rest in such a place, because once people enter the rest state, they will sink and then be woken up. They must always hold the top of the cage to ensure that they can breathe the air, so they can never rest, and when the body soaks in the water for too long, there will be a series of special circumstances, such as the body will be swollen, skin It will start to fester, and then the sudden death rate will start to rise. In a few days, it will float completely, and then slowly become stinky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catalina has been shut down for three days, and her body has also experienced such a situation, she took off all the clothes, red fruit The body is soaked in the water. Perhaps many people think that this should be a scene of seductiveness, but in reality it is very terrifying. Her body has begun to swell, and those clothes that don't swell with the body suddenly become sharp weapons. If they don't take off, they will tear her body into pieces and accelerate her death. In addition, dark purple scars have appeared in some places. For up to two or three days, the skin and muscle tissue will begin to rot and become a floating body within three or five days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not consider that the people of the Tushenism only put her here but did not interrogate her, she is also very scared at this time, no one can calmly face For death, even a saint can't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tied her long hair to the iron on the top of the cage to prevent herself from sinking, and had the opportunity to rest. Every day from the skylight, someone would throw some Vegetables leaves and fruits come down, sometimes there is meat, but the meat sinks. Now, she feels that she may not be able to hold back. She wonders why these people still don't interrogate her. So, drown her here without asking anything? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cartena’s question is also a matter of hesitation in the Tusi’s elders who have figured out the identity of Catalina and arrested her. The problem now is that the trial will not be examined. What to do after the trial is to kill or continue to be held or let her go. These problems have been interfering with the trial because everyone does not know how to decide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;killing her, this will anger the military, those people will definitely come to madly bite them, even if they have completed the transformation, they will continue to stare at them And then kill them. If you don't kill her, it is also a trouble to raise her. This kind of intelligence training personnel with special training has a strong personal ability. To be honest, no one in the soil gods thinks that Catherine can be firmly locked in a certain In the cell, so now she is temporarily put into the dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
