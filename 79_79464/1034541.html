			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden silence in the conference hall made Federer himself a little embarrassed. Of course, he could not stand out for the shit social responsibility to become the "other" to expose the west. There are so many shady scenes, he does not have any gains except for the fact that his calm life is too boring to find a way to kill himself. But now it is different, because he saw the rise of a brand new giant, and as one of them, he needs to be well prepared for his future interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the point of telling a lie? He has not hurt anyone, even God will forgive those who lie! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want someone to interrupt me again, I will give you plenty of time to ask questions, but before that, this is the last time!" Federer pointed to the reporter. If he didn't say this, he might be interrupted next. The most fearful thing when doing something focused is the sudden interruption, which may make people forget themselves. What I said just now, what to say below, there are terrible mistakes and results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federer is very honest, he doesn't want to die, he doesn't want to be disabled, he has to do it well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be some understanding of the reporters and other enthusiasts in the community. The backwardness of the west is closed and the west becomes the 'other world' in the empire's territory. Here, the agreement reached by the people through verbal is often more effective than the contract. People also believe that the use of lynching can lead to a more just trial. This is a backward place, and many people still believe that eating hot horse can cure diseases. "Federer paused when he said it, and there was a continuous laugh in the conference hall." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reporters who have seen many incredible things in the north and south, eating hot horses to treat diseases and some small countries believe that drinking the original girl’s blood can It is as stupid and ignorant to cure. This ignorance comes from the difference in education levels and the poor information that exists in the information society. Of course, there are still many enthusiastic people who will confess ignorant rumors after the change of the supervisor, and make things that may not be strange become strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The West, which has no cultural knowledge and is full of curiosity, has become a place where rumors prevail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next, what I want to say is related to the west that you can't see. We will talk about the mining area and the mine owner..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening A little humor can't hide the cruelty and cruelty that Federer will say next. The smiles that existed on people's faces soon faded away, becoming serious and even indignant. Because Federer’s description made them feel a heavy weight that they couldn’t tell, when they heard that they could buy a healthy adult from a slave trader for only a few tens of dollars, and most of these adults would die in the mine. In the time, the standardization of morality made a fiery dragon, roaring in their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every civilized society has a moral measure that is consistent with the values ​​of the public. In the prosperous society of the Empire, every educated person has just At the school stage, their teachers and family members will tell them the truth, that is, human life is precious and unique. No one can take away the lives of others at will, and must not unscrupulously dominate the lives of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things that can be used as universal values ​​do not exist in the West, or exist only between Imperial citizens...? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Federer’s description, the intrinsic impression of the West has gradually begun to change dramatically. This is a terrible world where money, status, power and other desires dominate. The behavior of everyone. As long as they can get enough profits, they dare to use the abolished slaves to mine the mines. They dare to kill the slaves who are unwilling to obey and hang on the pillars and dry them into a big meat to deter other slaves. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How slave owners in the slavery treated slaves in the past, how these miners in the west treated hard miners, and even done more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Federer glanced at the stationery on the Doolin desktop when there was no sound other than the sound of the tip and paper friction. Suddenly said: "I believe that some people may think that my statement is too exaggerated, even to obey a purpose for some purpose, so I specially invited a very special person, his name Called Amon. He was also a slave three months ago, but his luck is very good, so today he has the opportunity to stand here and tell you the truth..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small man who is not the same as the various races of the empire came in from the side door of the conference hall. He wore linen clothes and looked very special artistic sense. Unlike the culture and art of the empire. Some reporters who have interviewed international affairs have suddenly recognized the origin of this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked to Federer's right hand, pressed his hand to Du Lin's chest, and then faced the numerous reporters in the conference hall, took off his hat and revealed pure black hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Amon, Amon Lexmons, I am one of the slaves mentioned in Mr. Federer’s mouth, before this was, but in Recently, I have another identity. The people of Yaoxing Empire called me and some of my friends as members of the Freedom Front Organization..." The entire conference hall never had a bit of noise until it almost shattered the windows. People are screaming or shouting in surprise, and more people are whispering, because in the official manuscript they got, there is no fish in the Freedom Front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But here, there is one, does it mean that the task of the Western Military Region to annihilate the Freedom Front is indeed something that some people say, there are some invisible conspiracy. Conspiracy theories are always the most market-oriented arguments. Whether you are hurt yourself or not, you can classify a series of incomprehensible behaviors into conspiracy. The appearance of Amon is the best evidence, at least in the military area to completely annihilate this argument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument continued for more than ten minutes and finally calmed down. Amon continued to say, "Today I am here, I want to take what I have experienced. I saw you, I heard you, let you evaluate my friends and my friends according to your moral values ​​and values. Is it the member of the extremist organization you said?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Amon started from his hometown and said that he was dreaming of going to the outside world with a dream, and he was fooled by the fishing snatch team. On the ship, he talked about the ugly ugliness of every scene he saw in the process of crossing the east and west coasts of the empire, and he finally became a slave, in a mine that was dark and dark, like a night. Full of desperate work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing can be more appealing than what is said to happen to him. From time to time, his eyes are red and the hate of the words is clearly communicated to each. In the reporter's ear, they are enjoying a painful and desperate journey, and with Amon and more slaves step by step from the sun to the hell. When they heard that Amon had some long-term malnourished miners sick, not only did they not get medical security, but they were dragged into some abandoned mines by the mine protection team to kill and bury them, just to save the food of this patient, the meeting There were more than a dozen crisp breaks in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
