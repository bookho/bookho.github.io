			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun rises completely to bring a touch of warmth to the darkened land, the slaves and employees are concentrated in the square of the slave life area. They looked at the grey-eyed people who stood around the whistle-speaking tower and walked back and forth with their guns, and their hearts were full of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was yesterday that the demon in their hearts was like a demon from hell... No, the more terrible Mr. Andorra than the devil, the attack on these people It has become a past tense. When people introduce Mr. Andorra again, most of them will put a prefix in front of his name - the word that passed away, or return to the embrace of God. To do all this is The young man, the young man standing on the whistle tower on the left side of the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is talking to Mr. Federley’s lawyer. He killed Andorra. The frictional conflict between him and Andorra originated from this. The demand for the mine, Du Lin is now considering whether there is any way to win the mine, but not so bloody. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the practice of some big capitalists in the west and horse thieves who specialize in "mine transfer" trade, they will completely wash the entire mine without leaving any A live mouth, and then transfer the mining area to the auction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two main reasons for doing this. The first point is to protect yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western is the adventurer and the paradise of these horses are right, the sparsely populated Great West wants to find a group of people’s whereabouts than to eat a hot horse. It’s still hard to say – it’s worth mentioning that eating hot horses is a treatment method advocated by some shamans who claim to be gods in the west. When most of the sick people come to the door for help, they will recommend these patients to eat. Hot horses. As for the relationship between eating hot horses and treating diseases, there is no medical pathology, no one knows, but there are always one or two people who have finished eating hot horses. It has not been cured for a long time, so many generations of old people living in the west are sick. It is still highly respected to eat hot horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return to the topic, the urbanization of the West has always been the lowest in the Western world, each city is far apart by a distance of 9%. The land of the ten is the Gobi, the canyon and the desert that have not been developed. Only about 10% of the places are inhabited and are cities. So when these horses are really ironic to hide, even if they mobilize the Imperial Army, they may not be able to annihilate them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, this has brought some trouble to the life of the horses. Like the urbanization problem mentioned above, the supply of the horse is the most terrible trouble. These horses, which rely on looting and killing, cannot harvest their own farms or graze. Their supplies are also from the cities. Therefore, every time they send their horses to the city in the name of mining purchases. supply. If their appearance was discovered by the slaves or other people and reported to the police because of their kindness, they were ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are very likely to be caught without their knowledge and then be cut off in the eyes of the public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, Ma’s strategy for the mining area is to kill and leave no hidden dangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem is the issue of the receiver. After the cleaning of the mine, the horses cannot operate by themselves. The purpose of doing so is almost always employed by some people. Big capitalist. The big capitalists have taken a fancy to a mine, but if they don’t agree, they will spend money to hire the stables to clean the mine, turn the owned privatized mine into an unowned publicized mine, and then the city government. Or the state government will auction the mine, and they will take the mine calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they will never want anyone on the mine, the ghost knows if there is any irons in front of the mine, and half of them come out and put their agents People are slaughtered, or riots have occurred, which is also a trouble for these "financial" capitalists. The troublesome places not only need to spend another sum of money to suppress the riots, but also pay a large amount of high pension, which is different from their business strategy, so buying a clean mining area is easier to manage than buying a mine with others. Also more assured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why spend the same money, why bother yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two main reasons are the sense of crisis in the western mine owners, so as long as the cost of the mine protection team is within their tolerance, they will Expand the size of the mine protection team as much as possible to ensure your personal safety and property safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin does not intend to kill these people, he is not a butcher's executioner, there is no need to kill so many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking to the lawyer for a little while, the lawyer gave him a suggestion to legally acquire ownership of the mine in accordance with the law of inheritance. According to the law relating to imperial property, if a person dies naturally, his property will be inherited by his designated relatives. If the property in the bank does not have a designated heir, the heir cannot prove his relationship with the deceased within the prescribed time and Take out the legal documents, then the bank will swallow these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mine is not the money in the bank account. These things are inevitably inherited by Andorran’s family. If their family is independent and unwilling to sell or donate the mine to Doolin, Dulin is the legal owner. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good way, simple and legal, which is why Du Lin likes lawyers. They are always able to find the most appropriate explanation for your absurd exaggeration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him think of Kevin, but Kevin’s guy is still in the city of Otis, and he will be transferred to justice after the new mayor takes office. The ministry is a staff member. This is a good part of the deal between Doolin and Magus, about his transaction to execute the recall order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice sent the megaphone to Doolin, Du Lin patted, and sent the voice of pengpeng, and the entire camp was quiet. He looked down at the ragged clothes in the slave's living quarters, and the slaves shivering in the cold wind, the voice became loud and loud through the loudspeakers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, expelled the darkness and brought sunshine. From today, this mine belongs to me, Doolin."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So from today, everything here will change dramatically, and the biggest change is you..." Duolin pointed to those in the slave camp, "I I know that you are from other continents, from different countries, because you have appeared here and become slaves for various reasons. Today, I decided to bring you something different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On my site, working for three years, as long as three years, you will become a free person again. I will improve your working environment, living environment and living environment for you. And will also give you a salary. The salary may be lower than the average Imperial miners, about 20 or so a month, which will allow you to bring some things when you choose to leave home three years later. Go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;"I will respect your beliefs and living habits, and will make you feel that you are not trapped here, but choose to work here. I have brought you upward changes, good changes, but also There will be stricter rules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I may not be a good person, but I am definitely a person who abides by the rules, and I hope that you can abide by the rules I have established. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyers on the side wanted to insert a mouth to tell Du Lin that there is absolutely no need to treat these slaves too well. According to the current law of the empire, only the citizens of the country and the legally entering foreign citizens enjoy the protection of the law. These non-citizens It is also a slave who has been smuggled by traffickers. Even if they kill their empire, there will be no much movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they did not exist in this land, since they did not exist, what is the relationship between their true non-existence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s idea is not the same. He knows the danger of mining. In this industry level, it is far from the world’s industry in the dream. Level, even in the world of dreams, there are often news that foreign mines have collapsed, and it is normal for the world’s mines to collapse. It is absolutely unnecessary to let the Guars mine, and these slaves are the best miners. Give them hope, give them treatment, and let them accept it from the original resistance to the satisfaction. I would like to thank Andorra and the entire western mine owner for his attitude towards slaves, so that he only needs to give some small favors to buy these slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, those slaves boiled up in an instant, and they still have some doubts about Doolin’s words, but this has changed a lot, isn’t it? Not only do you have the opportunity to go home, but you can also bring a sum of money back. They are no longer slaves, but workers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the ordinary employees here, Doolin also took some changes, in addition to raising a little salary for them, but also provided some benefits that they had never had before. Treatment, in simple terms, everyone has a better life and foundation, and everyone is very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the deterrent of death and better welfare, these people will not make any unwise moves in a short time, and even if they want to make Such a move, I am afraid that Du Lin will not give them a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this decision is because there are too many slaves in the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are from abroad, most of whom are deceived into the empire are deceived by the idea of ​​changing themselves and their families through work and hard work, after being slaves They are almost desperate, but Du Lin will bring them redemption! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group does not have any interest disputes in the empire, the purest "person" is also a force that Du Lin needs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
