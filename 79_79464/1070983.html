			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The document has been approved..." Taylor stood in front of the executive chairman of the Imperial Bank and submitted three documents to the past. He was very reserved and kept his head slightly lower. He never used his own eyes to get in touch with the executive chairman's eyes, and even his face didn't look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status, the gap in status, he does not dare to look up, the 60-year-old man sitting in front of him has 7:9% of the central bank of the Empire The shares are the ones with the most shares. They have all experienced the turbulent times. After Magus took the stage, he lost the support of the nobility and the royal family. He was financially tough and even sacrificed the soldiers’ pension in the Great Patriotic War. Can't afford it, let alone talk about rebuilding the Yaoxing Empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he, and another group of people stood up and, as a humble "seller", provided Magus with a note even today. It is amazing wealth. Relying on this wealth, Magus paid the pension in full to the families of the sacrificial soldiers and received the support of the army. At the same time, relying on this money, the foundation reconstruction of the southern city of the empire was completed. In recognition of the dedication of these highly patriotic merchants to the country, Magus personally issued a request to allow them to establish the Imperial Bank of the Empire, the predecessor of the Imperial Central Bank before its name change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in the name of an individual, Magus deposited the first money, a dollar, and Magus personally in the Imperial Bank of the Empire. The bank account number is No.000000001. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move has extraordinary political significance, representing the new party’s new regime of the empire and Magus himself’s support and affirmation of the Imperial Bank of the Empire. The behavior also led a large number of people to deposit their own money in the Imperial Emperor Bank, which laid the unrivaled position of the Imperial Emperor Bank in politics, economy and people's livelihood. As a result, a large number of investors were attracted. Finally, after three rounds of financing, Emperor Imperial Bank was renamed the Imperial Central Bank and has continued to this day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to incomplete statistics, forty-one percent of the wealth of the entire Yaoxing Empire is locked in the Imperial Bank’s underground vault in the Imperial Capital, if anyone can burglary The underground treasury of the central bank's head office, then as long as the robbers succeed, they are the richest group of people in the world, none of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is not easy, not to mention defensive protection measures, even if you open it for people, how much can you take? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the big bankers have become the top force that can't be ignored in this industry. Taylor even deliberately put a lot of light on him. He dared not look up, but he was eager to see the old man with ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man glanced at the documents on the table and did not move. "Talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes!", Taylor bowed his head and said, "The General Chamber of Commerce has very much endorsed our proposal to establish an industry standard and access system. Mr. Smith, a rotating member of Parliament, believes that this can serve as an example for the insurance industry. The first step is to eliminate the possible industry chaos and play a key role in promoting the development and planning of the insurance industry. The Chamber of Commerce will strictly control the handling and issuance of insurance business company documents and will communicate with us in a timely manner." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man nodded. He picked his eyebrows and looked at Taylor without any movement. Under his gaze, Taylor began to sweat slightly. The old man’s seemingly unremarkable gaze gave him a lot of pressure, and he felt that he felt some chest tightness and could not breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the old man asked, "Are you a first-class partner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Taylor’s nod to say that he is now the lowest-level partner of the Imperial Bank, and that he can get a dividend that is at least ten times farther than the salary of the Imperial Bank every year. But this is only the lowest-ranking partner. He not only wants to climb higher, but also wants to become a shareholder of the Imperial Bank, even if it is one-hundredth of a share. This not only means that he will continue to gain huge profits in the future, but also represents his personal status, power will become higher and more, and will be respected and respected by more people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have done a good job in this matter, and the board and I are very satisfied. When we were sitting together chatting yesterday, I thought you If such a talent is only the first level of the partner is a humiliation of the talent, we agreed that after the matter is completely implemented, you will be nominated to become a third-level partner, and allow you to hold the insurance company no higher than 100 Three-thirds of the shares."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe one day, I can see you on the board."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last second is also because of the tremendous pressure to feel some suffocating Taylor has a speeding heartbeat, the heartbeat of the plop is gradually taking up all his perception, in his world, his heartbeat The sound is like a huge sheepskin drum being hammered by a heavy hammer, and he is duangduangduang in his ear. Because the heart rate accelerates the flow rate of the blood, the faster metabolism makes him look red and sweaty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the third-level partner, not only will have more wealth, but also the status of the imperial central bank will be significantly improved. After he can reach the five-level partner, he has the right to apply for the shares of the imperial central bank. Although the fixed amount of shares can be purchased, this is a breakthrough. From the imperial central bank's employees to fight everything into a partner, and then from the partner into a shareholder, and finally have the opportunity to enter the board of directors to become part of this economy, think about things that are exciting to tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, he was also allowed to buy a 3 percent stake in the insurance company, which has already told him that he will inevitably enter the board of directors and become a shareholder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No way to do this, no big economy itself will face many problems and contradictions, for the now bloated imperial central bank, personnel Redundancy is a top priority, and at the same time, new and old members in the high-level have already appeared. Either the old, the younger, the lesser, and the other, relying on the shares of the family and the elders to mix in the days, there are not many people who really do things. For example, Phyllis is such a typical example. Usually, it seems to be very capable in the emperor. In fact, many times it is dependent on the relationship of his family members such as parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when it was put in the place, it immediately became a huge loss, and it also caused a high-level watering in the high-level council. Woke up. Not everyone is afraid of the imperialist central bank. They are not willing to be enemies with the imperialist central bank. Not everyone must sell their faces. There are always people who dare not give them face and dare to offend them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the role of personal ability is reflected, so the Council has been holding a small high-level meeting recently to discuss the institutional issues in the next personnel. First of all, we must solve some redundant personnel, kick these people out of the personnel establishment of the imperial central bank, release the rising space of every class within the central bank, and stimulate the employees of each class to give them more motivation to dedicate their own abilities. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is to promote young people with strong business abilities to enter the decision-making level, so that young minds and thought storms will escort the future of the imperial central bank. Among the young Junyan mentioned, there is Taylor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did a very good job in the West, saving the temptation left by Phyllis and flipping the situation. As for the admission of the Southern Commercial Bank, it was not the responsibility of Taylor. He also had no ability and authority to fight with the shareholders of the South Commercial Bank of Perito. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
