			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Simon, have a drink at night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shady place on the site, Simon is in the corner There was a sneak sneak in the smoke, and the outside sun was too strong, making the entire site like a steamer. Ice cubes came in one car and the car, in order to avoid heat stroke, the workers wrapped the ice that had been broken with a towel and put it on the helmet. The blazing sun will let the ice melt continuously, so that the ice water will continue to drip down, constantly taking away the heat from them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the work in the summer is very hard, the money given by the workers is very rich. Everyone is working hard, isn’t it just to make more money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the foreman of this site, there are many workers who are residents of the town where Simon used to live. Because he can say that the road is not awkward, he has gradually become a foreman. Take everyone to find a job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned his head and looked at the guy standing next to him, and took his gaze back. "There is no time at night, I have to hurry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t like unionists, and there are certainly no good things for those who take the initiative to find them. He had encountered such a thing before, and the trade unions asked him to put pressure on the workers. At the beginning, he just came out to do things, stupidly took the workers’ union’s words seriously, and knew little about these things, it was stupid. Followed. Indeed, their salary was a little more, about 5 percent, but the problem was that they would have given him three phases of the project, and the end of the first phase let him get out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gradually understood that no one in this world is a fool, whether it is to pressure those who use the work, or to put pressure on others, and finally unlucky forever They are all workers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the workers’ union? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They surely won the war with the capitalists again and again, and received wide attention and praise from the society. No one will be in charge of the lives of the workers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Simon seems to have little interest, the guy who is not too hot in the suit is smiling, nodding his head and then preparing to leave, "This is the president of the union." Nodding activities, you are a worker's representative of the trade union. If you don't participate in the group activities, the score will be reduced, maybe it will be downgraded.", he said, he smiled. "I know what you are worried about, rest assured, I promise this time. After the event, no one will be forced to leave here, you will still find enough work here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is not untargeted. Once the strike is successful, the union suppresses the city hall and the capitalist. If they want to start work, they must bow to the union. When you contact one or two smaller projects, everyone will cooperate, not afraid that the capitalists will not bow their heads, nor will they fear that the mayor of the city hall will not bow. Moreover, the president of the trade union generals nodded in person to agree to the matter, and absolutely no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the trade union firmly controls the employment market in the city of Otis, the weight of the union in the city will become very important, just like many Like the city, it can even influence the direction of politics and the direction of public opinion when necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon was hesitant, and the guy in the suit took out his handkerchief and wiped the sweat from his forehead. "At 8 o'clock in the evening, the old Tom Tavern!" He waved his hand and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon sullenly sucked the last few cigarettes, pointing at the two young men who came out of the town and squinted and walked over." Don't be lazy, don't be lazy. I am writing to tell your parents!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers on the entire site suddenly laughed, and the two young people suddenly turned red. I am ashamed to find something to get into. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the night, Simon found a few old folks together and told them about the afternoon, I hope everyone can discuss an idea. This is his usual practice. After all, he is a local person, and he has worked together for several years. He knows each other well. He is not the kind of dictatorship. This is why everyone is willing to follow him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I estimate that it has something to do with the accidents of the past few days...", the oldest half-old man with a cigarette gun, squatting and sucking two A look of coziness. Otis is very hot during the day, but at night it is another look, especially cool. He smiled at a calm look that had already seen the glitz of the world and said: "You can go and see first, listen to what those guys say. If it is good for us, we will participate. If it is not good for us, we will Not attending, it's that simple!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others seem to be like this, Simon made up his mind, if not bad, he will participate. If it is not a good thing, then he will stay away from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night Simon wore a coat and came to the old Tom pub. He was a little surprised when he stood at the door. After pushing the door, he was a little dumbfounded, not a big pub. It was full of people, and he knew more than a dozen of them. He used to see him when he was working in the middle of Nam Lindes. He squeezed into a friend who was still a good relationship and sat down. He asked for a glass of wine and whispered, "What do you want to say today? Why are there so many people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;His friend smiled and shrugged his shoulders and said, "It's a good thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good thing?", Simon hasn’t finished talking and quickly stood up from one It seems that the grandmother, who is in her seventies, has picked up a small glass of wine and spoke a polite thank you to sit down again. "How good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His friend looked back at the innermost seat of the pub and said, "Do you know the guy who fell from a height in the last few days?" Simon nodded, almost all the workers in the incident. I have heard that many people feel sorry for him. After all, every worker is the pillar of a family. Once the ability to work is lost, the whole family will face great difficulties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man continued: "Bucho said that the city hall and the employer did not seem to be paying for medical expenses and other compensation. They said that the guy fell. It’s his own problem, it’s not the damage that comes from the work, so there is no compensation, not even the medical expenses. The Bucho and the mayor have talked about it. The mayor’s attitude is very strong, so he plans to launch one. The strike allowed the city hall and the employer to give in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a good thing for us, by the way we can still raise a little salary, and if it goes out Don't worry about accidents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Simon intends to stay out of the way, but listening to his friends saying that the sense of justice in his heart suddenly flooded, he felt that friends did not say wrong. If the city hall and the employer are unwilling to compensate and also evade responsibility, then they must not let them fool the past so easily, let them know the power of the working class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At around 8:30 in the evening, Bucho arrived at the pub, where more than 50 foremen were gathered in the pub, and there were dozens of 20 Clearly expressed any unwillingness to participate in the union’s actions. But Bucho did not reluctantly mean what they meant, but in the heart they have already painted a × for these people. In the future, there will be no resources for these people, and he swears! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you all for coming to listen to me after a hard day, say some nonsense, I thank you very much, thank you!", he wore it from the crowd. In the past, I stood on the steps of the stairs inside. "I think the reason why I brought everyone together is clear. Yes, we need to get justice for our injured community. Those abominable capitalists and snobbery municipalities. The hall can use the money to squander, eat, drink, and play, but is unwilling to take responsibility for a worker who needs help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since they are not willing to do this, then we need to use our power to make them understand that we are not without nothing, we are not alone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We The working class is always a powerful force. We don't want to show our edge all the time, but when we need it, we don't mind revealing our muscles!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; &nbsp; "Strike!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucho looked awkwardly at these foremen, "Strike! Only strikes can let them understand what they did wrong, axioms and Justice is on our side. The president personally instructed that he would support us in this strike, and some other social groups would also support us. We are not trying to get more salary, nor to pursue better. Welfare treatment, we only want to give our injured workers a fairness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is destined to make many people sleepless nights, including Bucho’s own I didn’t fall asleep late, especially when he just returned. Workers' Union, when lawyers will march Turin personally approved the application and handed him, he is confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He already knows that Doolin has a very strong character and knows that the mayor likes to use the word, so he required the law to be held before the parade. An application was filed. He did not think about the approval of the Doolin, and in his thoughts, Du Lin probably did not approve the application of the union. But it doesn't matter. He has already contacted the president of the president. He will apply directly to the state. If the state does not agree, he will apply to the higher level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he didn’t think that Du Lin would actually agree. Why did he agree? Or is there any conspiracy, or is he aware of the seriousness of the problem and is ready to compromise? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is not known, but the only thing that is known is approval. In two days, he will hold a huge strike parade, perhaps I knew what Du Lin was thinking. At the same time, Du Lin will also know that no matter what conspiracy he has, in the face of tens of thousands of workers, any conspiracy is fragile like a toilet paper, can not withstand the impact of heavy rain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the sun is still rising, the city of Otis does not see any strange atmosphere, the workers at every construction site are working hard, and no one Being lazy. Everyone is screaming, waiting for the moment the sun rises after a few hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
