			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason’s smile is a bit embarrassing. The main reason for him to become a sheriff is actually a direct relationship with Du Lin. Du Lin successfully left Mr. Xerma's management, gained freedom, and went to the life he wanted. This has a huge impact on the older children in the family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason as the eldest son, he felt that he also needed to do something, instead of silently watching Du Lin and everything that might happen to him. The "Rotten Rule" night has been torn open by Doolin, who needs to continue to tear this hole away and let the sun shine in - in fact most children will think of stereotypes, seriousness, stubbornness and dictatorial parents. It is a party to the evil camp. This is understandable. After all, people are born with freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mason bravely became the second family member to stand up against "tyranny", he thought that as the eldest son, this is his mission, but also His mission, but now he dare not say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he compiled a reason to be able to pass, explaining his yearning for the badge, his desire for police uniforms, and his dream of a just cause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin regained his gaze and looked at Mr. Xerma. In the past, Dooling did not dare to look directly at Mr. Kemma. In this family, there is no doubt that Mr. Kesma is the existence of the pyramid spire. He is the king of the world, but after a period of social turmoil Du Lin suddenly felt that Mr. Kemer was actually a very amiable guy in addition to his barely maintained majesty, but he used the wrong way of expression. He stubbornly believes that his life experience and experience can be applied to everyone, but ignores that some people should not surrender to fate by nature. They are warriors who challenge the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma took a sip of cigarettes. The inferior tobacco tastes a bit pungent, not as fragrant as a cigarette with a filter in an iron box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a roll of money from his pocket, but there wasn’t much, a thousand. This money is not a big deal in terms of production and sales. The eyes of Mr. Kesma and Mrs. Kesma were immediately attracted by a thick sum of money in Du Lin’s hands, and their brains were blank at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know the numbers and know that the outermost one is ten denominations, so if a thick one is ten denominations, how many more? ? Three hundred pieces? Still five hundred? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the metal friction sounded when the car was running was far and near, and it stopped at the door of Mr. Xerma’s house. Two young men took two heavy boxes out of the trunk, slowly mentioned the steps, and knocked on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma’s expression is very complicated. He took a deep look at Du Lin and said that after I went to open the door, I got up and walked to the gate. Did not look, opened the door. Two fifteen or six-year-old boys politely shouted "Hello," and dragged in the box and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma looked at the beautiful car and said sincerely: "It seems that you are really rich, Du Lin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to some private wines, there are some clothes and some small things in the two boxes. Every member of the family has it. For Mr. Xerma is a full box of cigarettes. - About one foot long and half a foot wide and half a foot high iron box, inside is a box of cigarettes, a total of fifty boxes, should be enough for Mr. Kema to take a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, there is a small wooden box that looks ordinary. Du Lin took the small wooden box and hit Mason with his shoulder. A glance at Mr. Ke Ma, went to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men followed for a while and immediately followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the sacred "Imperial Palace" of Mr. Zema, Du Lin closed the door, then placed the small wooden box on the table and opened it cautiously. Mason and Kesma were curiously surrounded, and they didn't know what it was to be treated with such care and caution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two small pockets of flannel in the box. Du Lin took one of them and poured the contents out. It was a pistol. Some scratched pistols seem to have been used for some time, but fortunately, the usual maintenance is not bad, the catalyst replacement is also very timely, and there is no leakage and corrosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the pistol, Mr. Xerma’s brow slightly twisted and his expression became heavy. He lowered his voice, with a terrible fierce face on his face, like the expression of the children who had done something wrong in the past decade. He reached out and took the pistol from Du Lin's hand and opened the insurance. He felt that his face was getting worse when he felt the grip on his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the two pistols in the wooden box, there are four box bombs - in fact, bullets can be done in many places, the simplest is to use just right The steel braces are broken into one section, as long as they can be inserted into the feeder. Although such a bullet is simple, but the lethality is limited, the ability to stagnate is not very strong, but the victory is easy to make, so Du Lin only brought four boxes to bounce back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
