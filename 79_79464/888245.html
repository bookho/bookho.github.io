			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nears sat on the sofa after closing the door, and the room of the Governor’s House was much more luxurious than the house of ordinary people, not only the bedroom, but also the separate grooming There is also a meeting room in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licked his face, buried his face deep between his hands, and the whole person screamed with a decadent atmosphere. He had already contacted his family before he came. After all, he would definitely worry if he didn’t go back to his wife and children overnight. Maybe they wouldn’t worry about it for a while, because he would stay in prison for a long time and grow up. It’s hard to come out in this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?", Nels put down his hands and looked at Kevin confusedly. "What should I do to make the judge sympathize with me?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin closed the notebook on the table, and he opened the curtains to let more sunlight come in. "You push the responsibility to Vivian." My brothers, in fact, it’s a bit simple to tell the truth, and then add a little sadness and helplessness. As long as the jury has sympathy for you, they can even think that you are innocent.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nears heard Kevin say this, suddenly full of hope, he just stood up and prepared to go to Kevin, and felt that he was a little reckless, and sat back again, "you will help I am playing this lawsuit, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin nodded indifferently, "As long as you can afford the money, you are my boss!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not less than 300,000!"<br />< Br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last moment was filled with hopes when Nilston fell into the ice cave, the number of 300,000 made him feel that the light has become a lot weak, he can not get this Money, or he can get it, but his family will lose their current life. The art that they stole in these years sold nearly 156 million in private transactions on the federal side. He and another craftsman each got more than 400,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money was used by him to buy homes and enjoy life almost half, and 200,000 were lying in the bank. If you want to get 300,000, he must sell his current house and two cars in his hand, and sell all the expensive luxury goods to get 300,000. The money is too much, he can't pay, and more importantly, paying the 300,000 does not mean that he can be acquitted, perhaps just to ease his sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actually... you still have a way to get rid of the crime, that is to get the forgiveness of Mrs. Vivian!" Kevin took a cigarette and his elbow pressed against the arm of the chair. The high back chair of the bag stood behind him. His arms were vertical and his fingers were holding cigarettes. It seemed to give people a visual impact that couldn’t be said, especially his smile, which made Nils feel behind him. The red leather on the chair is like flowing blood, full of sin and desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved his butt to Kevin, sitting at the end of the couch, leaning forward and looking at his head. "What should I do?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three days in the next session, this time is for both parties and their lawyers to find more evidence to support their views. When the three days were about to come, Vivienne’s two brothers sat together and they discussed the next few things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy lawyer of the Luxury Lawyers Group told them that this is a lawsuit that is likely to win. These lawyers are excited and look red, whether or not they will recognize them. Using the power of the collective to win Kevin, this is a huge victory for them! Once the lawsuit is settled, their value and status will skyrocket. Even if the two brothers decide not to pay any of their lawyers, they will be happy to represent the lawsuit free of charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have already asked someone to evaluate it. The old man’s things add up to about 30 million." Vivian’s big brother’s eyes have been focused on one. On the waitress's body, the girl is young and beautiful, but unfortunately she has a low-lying job, and if she wants, he doesn't mind raising the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Wei'an's second brother frowned and asked: "So little? Didn't we sell some 16 million in those things before?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Wei's big brother regained his gaze, "Alex, you have to know that the old man doesn't like those things, but it doesn't mean that those things are not good things. One of the stone carvings from the origin of the age sold nearly eight million, which is more than the sum of the remaining twenty pieces! The things in the warehouse can be sold so high, most of them are tens of thousands of thousands. There are 30 million things that I think are already very great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex, the point of Vivian’s second brother Nodded, "There is no problem with this. Is this time we sell in the Empire or send it to the Federation as before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, it is sent to the federation. If we sell it in the empire, our face will not be too good-looking. If the old man just died, we will sell his things. What will others think of us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex nodded, he hesitated. "I don't think my sister will be so. She will definitely find a way to take back those things."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Wei's eldest brother Eide laughed very easily. "She? What can she do besides being a feminist warrior everywhere? Let those women attack us? If so, I think This is also a good idea. I really need an aggressive woman to calm my instigation." He said that he took a picture of Alex's back. "Do not worry, she can't do anything, just like before. That way, it’s a useless child!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I said this, Ed’s eyes flashed with a ribbon of sly and hateful eyes, he Recalling what happened at home when I was young. The Governor does not have so much time to educate them. Their daily life is decided by the Governor’s wife. But every time the Governor returns to his home, he will strictly reprimand the two boys and even beat them for a little thing. On the contrary, the Governor’s “love and add” to Vivienne, who is actually not so obedient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that time on, Ed did not like the old man. After he grew up, he understood that this is the performance of the old man’s love for him. He hopes to let himself go by being strict. The last successful road. But understanding understands, hate does not reduce half points, it is like someone slaps you and tells you that this is for you, even if it is really like that, it is impossible to be happy, only disgust or hate . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man pressed them for forty years, how many forty years can a person own? Two? Or one and a half? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aide has lived in the shadow of the Governor’s life for a lifetime. He has long been fed up. If it’s not the old man’s connections and friends, he said I have to do something that I should not do early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex does not agree with the contempt in Ai German. "She has at least invited a lawyer named Kevin, which is said to be the best in the empire. Attorneys, we must always be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aide has long been careful of the predecessors of the Governor who is still alive, he raised his head and leaned back in his chair. Tilted up the legs. Press one hand on the back of the chair and press it on the edge of the table. "Which is it? Here is Orodor, it is our house's Orodor, not the emperor. If there is an accident, let him disappear." ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean to kill him?" Alex's tone is a bit strange. He is engaged in administrative work after all. There is no such thing as a soldier like Aide. "Does this cause trouble?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trouble? Alex, you are too careful. Find a place where no one is going to kill him and send it to the city to burn it. I don't believe anyone can get from one. Find evidence in the pile of ash to accuse us." He said vowed, just like doing this, let Alex be a little better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Ed knows a guy named Amp, he probably won’t have this idea, he will not only burn Kevin to Ash, but also Kevin’s ashes were thrown into the sea along with the real gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation between the two brothers gradually shifted to the woman’s body. At this time, there was a small cap with a cap and a dry snot on the lips. The child ran over, holding an envelope in his hand and placing it on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Two, someone asked me to give this letter to you...", he did not leave after he finished speaking, but looked forward to it. These two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex found a piece of money from his pocket and gave it to the child. When he turned around, Ed had opened the envelope and read The content inside. His face became more and more terrible, and finally the letter was torn into pieces! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?", Alex looked at the letters that were shredded by Ed, bent over and picked up, then according to each piece The scallops on the edges try to put the letter back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed did not stop him, just lowered his voice and whispered in a voice full of anger, "You are right, that woman is not That's the end. You don't have to look at it. She knows that we and the two idiots are stealing things from the storeroom. He wants us to withdraw the case and end the dispute." He finished his chest with violent undulations. "How many things are hanging on the wall?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are about sixty or seventy...and that's all good!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor’s Office is too big, so more art is needed to embellish the Governor’s taste and appreciation of art. As the Lord’s Governor, it’s impossible to hang those cheap things. On the wall, the big aristocrats ridiculed his shit-like artwork, so he hung the best things out, except those he didn't like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
