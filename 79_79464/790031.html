			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that this is the source of the danger that James feels. He knows that this is a warning that Du Lin gave him. Even Du Lin has already guessed that he wants Called Juan, so he sent someone to cut his phone line. He slowly put the phone back in place, and his wife came to his study with fruit. His wife is a native, he is ten years younger than James, looks very beautiful, and has two children for him. For her wife, James always gives her the best things, whether she wants or not, she will give her what she can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loves his wife very much, and loves his children very much. He loves this family, and everything, he does not want to lose these wonderful things! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your face doesn't look too good, is it tired?", his wife put the fruit plate down and walked behind him to squeeze On his shoulder, "If you are tired, please take a break for a while, don't drag your body, our family can count on you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp James closed his eyes and enjoyed his wife's kneading. He sighed in a secluded sigh, raised his hand and touched his wife's smooth back. "Then these days, I will explain the work tomorrow morning, then rest." For a while, do you want to go out for a trip?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a negative snoring in his wife’s nose, a little spoiled feeling, James liked this voice "If you go out to travel, you have to waste a lot of money. Besides, Irian is the most famous tourist city in the empire. Do we have to go to the dusty and muddy countryside everywhere? Just rest at home!", she just loosened When I started, I remembered something. "Right, have you heard that? On Dawn Avenue The guy in a coffee shop was burned to death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" James suddenly woke up a little, and he turned his head and looked at his wife. “Is it an accident?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is suddenly very sensitive to these life-and-deaths. When he heard the death of a coffee shop, he immediately thought about it. A rumor of Dooling is said that every morning he will appear in a coffee shop on Dawn Avenue at six o'clock in the morning, read a newspaper, eat something to drink a cup of coffee, and then leave. He only met Du Lin at night, there is no way to not think of that person, a person who has a good way in his friend's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This friend of James is a staff member of the City Hall. He said that Du Lin is also casually mentioning, and there is no specific reference. It seems to be related to the fifth district. At that time, James did not care. At this time, I didn’t know how to suddenly think about it. I immediately felt that everything could be connected in a line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife said it in a curious tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the buddy has to work for a long time every day, every day is weak, but he is working hard enough, and there have been no mistakes. So the owner of the coffee shop did not dismiss him. When he came home from work the middle of the night, he might be exhausted. When he was doing something to eat, he accidentally stumbled on the kitchen table, ignoring the fact that the burning thing on the stove was not managed, and a fire broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buddy was burned to death on the spot, the fire station and the police station have already explored, and no accidents have been found, so the case is fixed. Received the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the end of the matter, whoever thought that the guy's parents had gotten up and found the workers' union. After the workers’ union negotiated, they decided to make this happen. They thought that the coffee shop owner’s rigorous staff caused the tragedy. Although the coffee shop owner did not need to bear the main responsibility, the secondary responsibility was there. According to the request, the coffee shop owner is responsible for the death of the buddy, two thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now both parties have already invited lawyers to prepare for the dispute through the courts, and many people are talking about this and possible outcomes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muscles on James’s face were uncontrollably twitching. He smiled softly to delay the true fluctuations in his heart. “So I often say if you are When you need to leave, you must leave the fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife nodded, but also a small counterattack, "but in the end Or because he is too tired, if he is not so tired, then such a tragedy will not happen, so I hope that you can take a good rest, do not go anywhere at home, sleep for a few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James pinched his wife’s hand and nodded hard. “Well, listen to you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never thought about calling Juan, not at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a good job!", Du Lin returned home and hung the coat on the hanger, glanced at the playing room and other people playing cards. Buddha, praised one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Buddha is really trying to deal with this matter, Doolin does not want to know what the process is, he only needs results. This result is very satisfying to him. What makes him more satisfied is that the workers’ union has been entangled with the coffee shop owner’s lawsuit, completely removing people’s attention from the death of the man. No one is paying attention to that now. There is no doubt about the death of the guy. He only cares about the process and results of this lawsuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha smiled and soon focused on the poker in his hands. They don't have any chips or bets, they are purely a way to kill time. Du Lin looked at the group of dedicated people, smiled and shook his head and walked up the ladder. After a while, I was afraid that they would play cards. They didn't have the heart to play cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin ordered three monochrome video players from the Imperial Capital. It’s just another TV in the world, but the TV here seems to be With black technology, development has deviated from the track of another world. Before the cable TV station appeared, there was already something like a video tape. This thing is integrated with the black and white TV set. The TV itself cannot receive any TV signal, and there is no line interface. If you want to play it, you must buy tape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua told him that a monochrome video player needs 1200 pieces, and those tapes that record movies are each thirty. Block money, now the major distribution companies and producers are filling new tapes insanely. Despite this high price, it still attracts the attention of many rich people. It is said that the first month's production has been fully booked, and the people waiting in line to pick up the goods have already lived at the door of the factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Du Lin’s new business is the story! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a giant of the George family in the cinema line. The so-called cooperation is simply unreliable. If Juan thought they were holding hundreds of cinemas in their hands and sat on the negotiating table and talking about the conditions of the George family, they could only say that his dream of getting rich had not yet woke up. For the giants like the George family, they may be more realistic in their minds of acquiring these resources in the hands of Juan. Would they be willing to let them divide the economic benefits and political benefits that can be expected in the future into these old hats? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly not, it is the George family, not a small rich man. Their influence in the political field is definitely the first person in the media. How can they compromise? Even if they give up this industry, they can't share their interests with Juan and Luke, the "little rich man." Every trust is not a good person. If they are good people, there will not be many people who will go bankrupt and be homeless! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this new venture can't do it, Du Lin saw another industry, that is, the future TV media. He had heard that the Imperial Academy of Sciences had already made qualified products on the assembly line, but it has not been released yet. Perhaps this explains why there is a video player-like thing synthesized on TV - they need content! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is not enough content, who will waste money to buy something worthless and meaningful? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly what Dulin has to offer a new direction of development, and this direction of development also has great potential. Once television is something that can satisfy almost everyone's entertainment requirements, the earliest batch of media will definitely swallow a giant. Perhaps these TVs are still unable to access the limited signal, but Du Lin believes that this day will not wait too long, in the end, the interests are pushing the progress of science and technology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for what he is doing now, he has an idea to set up the TV station first, and then hire some actors and other shows to perform some programs. To put it bluntly, it is to record in advance, then The recorded tape is sold to all users who own the TV at a cost price. Compared with the movies and operas that have been replayed numerous times, Du Lin's content that is close to the times and different in each period can definitely attract the attention of most people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who can spend $1,200 to buy a TV doesn’t care if he buys a piece of fresh tape with a dozen dollars a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, there is no strong dominance in this line, and it can even be said that Du Lin has not even an opponent! By then, he can really work with the George family to play the news in an imaged way! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issuing companies have to come to him to cooperate, provide packaging business, plus the advertisers these benefits, Du Lin has been able to imagine how big this cake is! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once he has a myriad of viscous users, when he sets up a wireless or cable TV station, these people will naturally become his most loyal customers. At the same time, his potential political influence will be greatly improved. If politicians want to promote their political ambitions and ideas in these middle- and high-class families who have television and stable jobs and form the most important part of society, they must pay Du Lin and have a good relationship with Du Lin. relationship! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
