			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will introduce myself first.", sitting in the study room to let the people get tea and snacks, the conversation officially began after the door was closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Doolin, I don’t know if you’ve heard of the Polar Circle Foundation?" When Tony’s face was said to be honored, Very proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He showed himself without exaggeration. The Polar Circle Foundation is a leading hedge fund in the international financial community. They are mainly engaged in international currencies and some futures markets. Hedging transactions and having industries in multiple countries. Last year, some assessment agencies reported on the evaluation of the Polar Circle Foundation that the annual income of the Polar Circle Foundation has grown to 22%, which is very strong in this field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction of international wars and the arrival of peace have prompted many countries to focus on economic construction, such as developed countries such as the Federation. However, compared with the stable financial economic order of the federation, some small countries have not yet emerged from the shadow of war. The currency exchange rate fluctuates greatly, the demand for foreign capital is significantly higher than that of other countries, and it is often on the restricted side in large-scale trade. Not every country is willing to lend a helping hand to help others develop. There are always some people who are an attitude when they are weak and another attitude when they are strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can't do it the best, then let others be worse than you are obviously the most correct international diplomatic strategy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These situations make the financial tycoons eat a lot of oil, less risk, higher returns, no more way to make money than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not know much about the international financial community. Toya and he carefully said about this situation, let Du Lin’s polar circle fund There will be a more comprehensive understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I was very interested when I heard about Mr. Doolin’s plan from Mr. Jack. I convinced the Foundation. Other members, in the end we decided to try to gamble here." Toya does not seem to care about risk at all, and it is true. The money is not strictly Toya's own, nor the foundation. Some idle funds enter the foundation in various ways, and the foundation promises a guarantee of annual income, such as 3,597 percent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they use the money to trade, and draw relevant fees and pay wages, etc., even if they lose a bottom, will not affect their own interests. The fame and trust of this thing is not worth the money in the financial circle, even if this operation brought unbearable consequences, the polar circle collapsed, and Toya stinky. But as long as he can regain a high return for a new group of customers, people will soon begin to convince him and give him the money to operate. In the face of eternal interests, nothing is more important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to say, Mr. Doolin, you have unparalleled courage to plan the biggest robbery ever, before I decide to cooperate, can I Know more about it?" Toya couldn't help but take out a cigarette and gave it to Duolin. "I can't wait to know how you can rob a country's economic results. It will definitely be in finance." A page left in history, even if it failed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and asked for a moment, "Mr. Toya, trust this vocabulary In a person like us, don't you think it is a ridiculous word?", waiting for Toya to refute, Du Lin added, "If you sell me, I can bring you hundreds of millions of wealth, you think Will you be loyal to me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Toya closed his mouth and fell into meditation, Doolin continued, “If you sell you, you can I live a countless wealth, please believe me, I will not hesitate to sell you Get those wealth. Profit is more important to us than anything. Although I can't disclose more information to you, I will give you a clear signal when the plan starts. At that time, if you are willing Believe me, you can gamble with me. If you don't want to believe me, then you can stand opposite me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is confident Laughed, "This will make my harvesting wealth more!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Jack said these people are credible, but Doolin is not so I believe that at least not fully believe in these people. Once his plan is successful, the federation will lose at least tens of billions of tangible wealth and more intangible wealth. The value of this benefit has long exceeded the maximum measure width of the word loyalty. No one can resist such temptations. Du Lin would bet that if the Speakers in the Federation knew the plan, they would be crazy and even take a hand to plunder the wealth of their country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, they have a good excuse to explain their behavior - it is better to stay in the country than to lose overseas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
