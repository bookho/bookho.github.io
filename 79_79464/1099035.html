			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majeri is a smart person, otherwise he will never live now. When he exposed a chemical company secretly discharging chemical sewage, the chemical company He was mailed a lot of interesting things, from a normal bullet to an ordinary bullet, to a cat and dog that had been cut into pieces, and some clothes that were similar to his family. There were all kinds of wounds on the clothes, some were stabbed by the dagger, some were cut by the knife, some were with obvious bullet holes, the clothes were also sprinkled with a lot of blood, and a line was written on the box with blood. The word "may be you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him and his family very frightened, but he managed to survive the dangerous period because he was not the kind of Relying on people. In addition to the social public opinion that can help him to counter these powers and threats to a large extent, he provided some "cue" to his social enthusiasts to finally get it all, because the house seriously affected the environment, and because of chemistry Companies polluted by the environment that threatened water problems were investigated and eventually bankrupted for acquisition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who were ruined because of his reports were finally ruined, and his many years of career made him understand the truth, the horrible capital, and The capital is lovely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wealth you can do whatever you want, whether it’s movie stars, women with high-tech places, or luxury homes, yachts As long as you have money, you want, you can get it! People will respect you because you have the money to add a very comfortable name such as "Mr.", "Your", "Respected" in front of your name. Everyone cares about your opinion and is willing to listen. Your thoughts and respect for your personality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wonderful thing is almost the most enjoyable thing in the world, but first you need to have money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majeri called this "paid exposure", he gained money and visibility, and deeply purified himself as a good value and social responsibility The image of the reporter has become an unyielding fighter. Those who paid for his wealth also got what they wanted. They got rid of their competitors, made them ruined, or let a politician make some politicians notorious and fame. This is a win-win cooperation, he also began to adapt and even get used to this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to find enough news to stimulate people’s nerves and detonate people’s attention, without having to think about what kind of position they should write to get more public opinion. With the support and public recognition, everything has become so easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Du Lin asked him to come out to meet him. He understood that this was another business. After the two met, he had been following Du Lin’s words. This is part of the business. Although these wealthy people use money to purchase his articles and exposures, they also hope that he can stand on his own side, which will make the rich feel "safe." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did a good job, a dedicated young man, at least Dulin is very satisfied now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm not sure if I should say..." Du Lin looked hesitant. "You know that revealing some shady and secrets will always make people remember, I didn't want to say these things to others, but my conscience, my morality and my social responsibility made me unable to rest. I think I should say it and let more people know!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majri nodded with great compliments: "Your great sentiments are worth learning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think so? "During the thick face of Du Lin, like the city wall, he expressed the same feeling. "I think so, and I am doing it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next He began to reveal some shady scenes that need to be revealed. "In fact, some international hot money is going to attack the federal finances..." In the description of Doolin, these international hot money is like a greedy shark, smelling bloody. After the taste quickly gathered from all over the world to the federation, they are making a swearing Finance major, then using superheated federal financial backhand short, to reap huge profits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move is not new in the federation, the explosive rate and gameplay of federal business warfare are more advanced and more sophisticated than other countries, and there are many more brutal, some of which are Ma Jili also personally participated in it. The shady scenes he reported were the horns that blew the war, and it was difficult to distinguish between the two sides or the multi-party killings that continued to enter the game. In the early stage, fake news was used to make good news, and then the black curtains were used to create panic. If they could not resist, they would start a hostile takeover until the end of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majeri listened very carefully and also recorded some content in his notebook. He was just a bit strange because the news broke out not for any company and anyone. If you have to say yes, then it is international hot money, which has nothing to do with the federal internal. When did the leader of the criminal organization such as Doolin become so kind? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is not what Ma Jieli cares about. After talking about it for a while, Du Lin finished talking about it and took a cup of tea. He looked at Majeri, Ma Jili was checking his own notes, and after confirming it, he closed it up and said with a smile. "Now, there are fewer and fewer people like you who can be called social models. I will take them as soon as possible. This news was sent to the newspaper. I feel very honored to work with you. It is also a very meaningful thing." He took a sip with a teacup. "You may not know, in all our industries." The reporters are thanking you, many people have made you a confidant and an idol."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is uncertain whether this news is Du Lin’s conscience or Other reasons he didn't know, so he was not sure if the news was paid. Of course, even if Doolin does not give him money, he will write. He does not cooperate with all kinds of capitalists and big entrepreneurs every day. He always has to write something slightly neutral to update his social reputation. But if there is, it is not better, so he tempted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words caused Dolin’s curiosity, “Oh? Can you tell me why? I don’t have much contact with the journalists on the federal side. I am very curious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majeri said with a smile, "Because you have established new regulations for this industry, car and horse fees!", he talked, " In the past when we received an invitation to interview, the inviting party may entertain us for a delicious meal, but it is limited to this. They will not give us some small gifts, nor will we give us any car and horse fees, and finally in the interview. The expenses incurred in the process, such as road tolls, are also paid for by ourselves or reimbursed from the newspaper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But your actions in the empire make this Everyone in the industry has benefited, including me. We are invited to interview and don’t need to pay for it ourselves. We can also have a considerable salary, as well as all kinds of small gift souvenirs. People are saying yours. Ok, praise you as the cutest friend in the journalist industry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majeri said that Du Lin recognized the true face of this guy. He smiled and took an envelope from his pocket and placed it on the table. This action caused Majeri’s eyes to start to go out. He was no longer a newbie. He thought that it might be just a fifty or one hundred dollar bill. For a big man like Du Lin, they I don't bother to carry cash with me, it is definitely a check. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees that can and need to be paid by check are definitely not as chilly as their own ten dollars, which is definitely a happy one. The number, he pretended to be curious, "What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
