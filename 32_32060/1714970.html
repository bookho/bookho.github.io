It seems that the lady upstairs did not make a mistake. It turned out to be a small, ruined person in a broken place to seek benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what you are doing." Heber asked coldly, guessing what the people were going to say in his heart. "Hello, I have a little way to make the judges tend to be on your side, or, some suggestions, you can refer to it, your lawyers are too bad." In short, the end will say "Of course you have to spend some money."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the words of the comer surprised the Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan slowly sipped the water and waited for the patience of the other party to reach the limit. "Sorry, didn't buy a gift to celebrate your upcoming victory." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you see the trial? The lawyer can't help the prosecutor's cross-examination." Heber's heart and face were shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, really? In my eyes, the lawyers are retreating. Bai Tutai thinks that you have no evidence, his rhetoric, but instead I acknowledged the identity of Miss Paris, and when a key person appears, everything will be reversed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand what you are saying." Bo subconsciously changed the title to a title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one will be stupid, use an unreliable shawl and a few confessions to win the lawsuit."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we only have this, and we are resigned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dalmark old baron, really like propaganda, fell into a coma, few "Is it alive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Heber had a heart-wrenching, and the hotel was full of his people. The prosecutor who knew the secret couldn’t run away. But who knows if the other party has left anything to remind the imperial concubine, now this sensitive moment is not allowed by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no such thing as awkwardness, he..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran did not respond, he looked at the nervous viscount with a smile. "If the Supreme Royal Highness, under the banner of "Caring", allows the Baron to be taken somewhere to look after it, then whether he can appear in court is still unknown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You...do you have any suggestions?" Heber calmed down, and since the person came to pick it up, it would certainly not reveal his temper to the imperial rule - of course, if he could meet his requirements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A small prosecutor in a circuit court. If you want to climb up, you need someone to support and a ticket." Fran was greedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heber assured, "How much do you want?" At the same time, he thought, waiting for the lawsuit to end, and some ways to let this guy spit out the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which lord supports the Dahlmak family behind?" Fran shook his head. "Ten thousand Caesars, sometimes not as good as a big man, please Introduce for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You made me confused." Heber replied vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, we are all smart people, there is no tacit consent of a certain giant. You will have courage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And the royal court?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heber felt his secrets, let him see through, "Where there is..." I did not finish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaked by the palm of the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's hard to imagine that in a small place, there are such smart people hidden."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She Gracefully walked out from the corner leading to the third floor and looked at Fran with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her steps are brisk and powerful, her eyes are burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hebrew hurriedly stood up from the chair and yelled at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came towards him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short distance, at this moment, seems to have spent several years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is like a stone with a shape and an angle, otherwise it is not. Why is his blood and blood in his lungs and chest? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;恍惚, Fran returned to the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening is coming, in the sunset, the fountain pool, dyed the water mist of the golden mans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short-haired girl said arrogantly, "I am Peggy Don Leinschman, I hope you are a good opponent.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than three months is too boring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Peggy Don Leinschmann." Let Fran fall to reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Golden Sparrow." Fran said dryly, the inexplicable anger almost made him lose his mind, rushed over, used his fist, used his teeth, like Like a bloodthirsty beast, the girl was bitten into tens of thousands of pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of his variant is in the ears of others, seemingly incomparable to the gorse family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is both my master and protector." Heber said to Fulan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to be polite." Peggy and so on, after laying a soft mat on the chair, sat down slowly, looking at the frustrated Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, he slowed down, "Say hello to you, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Fran's plan was to get the inheritance rights, but let the real Paris escape from Darmark's manipulation, so he sought to meet the people behind the scenes and want to know who his true opponent is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not expect that it would be a gorse, it would be his enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your request, I accept, the gorse never swears to the wise." Peggy also misunderstood Fran's look, a savvy mind. With the clues, people who can speculate on so many clues, as well as ambitions and awe in the family, have always been the object of the Reinschmann talent pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing gently, Fran nodded slightly, "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They talked for a few hours, initially as a lawsuit, and finally from one topic to another topic. This is the feeling that Peggy is very difficult to understand, because the attitude of the other party is only a superficial compliment, and the lines of the words show an equal taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling, the girl only felt from a monkey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, she didn’t care about the “superficial compliment”, which was understood as a savvy person’s high level, or his acting to improve his price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which point, in the end, I have to wear a gold collar around my neck for her mastery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Fran, it’s hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t just leave, otherwise he will be suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He endured the negative emotions of his heart and responded gracefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the lawsuit is over, I will transfer you to the first court of Tantin." Peggy will be able to detect the strangeness of his identity, everything must be as soon as possible. Completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being deceived, will make this lady angry and angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Franma did not stop, found a car, and rushed to the town where the cardinals were waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time for his transformation is coming to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the town dozens of miles away from the town, he got off the bus, or waited until the town, the coachman will be surprised to find that the passenger suddenly changed appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking for a piece of woods, Fran waited for the end of the transformation, and he changed clothes, waiting in the suitcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the world is full of faint silver moonlight, the transformation has not yet ended, Fran can feel, the ring at the finger and the flesh and blood merge into one Hard, there is a hot flow of hot and cold, so that the beautiful looks continue to be maintained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it possible to extend the time of deformation?" Fran thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eternal remnant of the energy and the ring of the ring, under the attack of the holy flame of the holy warrior girl, melted into one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the energy of the ring is running clean, the power of the sacred object takes over the operation of the squad, unless the Fran himself lifts it, otherwise the morph can continue . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, Nicole sleeping in the outhouse was awakened by the knock on the door. "Who?" She was unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a friend of Casimodo, entrusted by him, come to visit." The person outside the door replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door is opened, the gray-haired middle-aged man is smiling towards her in the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please Miss Miss Paris, I am the prosecutor of the West, and Paris will be the key figure in the case of Darmark’s succession."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the team is yawning, carefully checking the documents of the middle-aged person and the letter of Quasimodo under the lamp. The letter says that the other party is trustworthy. Please follow the instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the team recognized Casimodo’s handwriting and confirmed it correctly. “Are you a prosecutor of Carl Tiven?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barui recited the name on the document. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Tiewen, what is your relationship with the big man? Why didn't he come back?" Nicole asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a very good relationship with him, so good as a person." The middle-aged man said meaningfully, "Casimodo has some personal things to do, So you can't come for a while. You are Miss Nicole, he mentioned you to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, what did you mention me?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and said, "Say you are as beautiful as a person in the picture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicole's little face wiped a blush and pouted, "The big man really has an idea for me, hey, wait for him to come back, not let him look good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Miss Paris, I will let you get the rights you deserve." The middle-aged is serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr.... Really, really?" Paris, who had been hiding in the shadow of the oil lamp, lowered her head and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please believe me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole embraced Paris with excitement, "Too Enviable, you have to be a noble, don't forget us when you come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris smiled reluctantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged person arranged, "I will leave early in the morning, and the trial will begin soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We will go too." The head of the team insisted, "With a letter, I can't believe you, just give the little Paris to others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party thought about it and agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peji received a notice from his subordinate on the morning of the fourth day of the initial trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time she is looking through a copy of the record of Carl Tiven’s career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer his file from the local court, it is easy for the big lady of the gorse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Strange, from the point of view of the file, this person is very mediocre. It is not worth investing in the stone like a roadside." Peggy pondered for a long time and ordered the re-survey . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be grateful that this year, there are no such things as cameras. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the magical magic of the Austrian Master, will not be wasted in the court files. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
