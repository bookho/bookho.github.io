			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Barry Sirana thought how to sway to show Casimodo, since I want to stay tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is an adult and can be responsible for their actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sky is very yin, even the moon can't see it, and the half of the road will be wolf when it encounters rain." The head of the group is in a small basin filled with warm water. Pick up the towel, wring it out, and gently wipe the corner of the mouth, she hinted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it’s going to rain." Fran looked out of the window, and the bright moon of the cleanliness had retreated behind the dark clouds, and the sparse stars were dull. I am going to call a rental carriage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barrying bites his lips, secretly blaming the incomprehensibleness of the wood, maybe she should be more active, the woman must be strong Hold on to your own happiness. Her charm still exists, and the ruin of the appearance of the years has not yet been reflected in her face. Thirty-five years old, it is the woman's most mature and splendid age, as if it is full of sweet fruit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether to remove stones and nerds, who can refuse such women? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan understands Barry’s mind and has been stupid. The strong and independent character of the head of the team is what he appreciates. He cherishes the friendship with her, but he does not want to sublimate this feeling into love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luxury and hopelessness, at least for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Fran was very happy, and Angkor rushed into the house, and resolved the short embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Cecilia lost!" The red-haired girl gasped out loud. "I am so damn, even a child can't see it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauren behind her, it seems much calmer, he succinctly described it again, in the restaurant of Silver Street, Cecilia slipped out to play, Nothing to come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have already reported the case to the police station. The director promised that the police officers who have patrolled the streets should pay attention to the lost children." Lauren said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran frowned his eyebrows. "We split up and look for a child, and we won't run too far."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just about to go out. The rain is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain in the autumn night is wild and raging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the wide streets fell into the water curtains. The dense raindrops beat the black oily road surface, the wind tore the air, the whistling of the treetops and leaves, expelling the people who wandered around at night, and flew to the shops and eaves that could shelter from the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To find her quickly, our little Cecilia will go to the gonorrhea." Barrie said suspiciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia squats out in the darkness of an unknown alley. Her hair was soaked and the long eyelashes were covered with water droplets, blurring the line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shoes don’t know when they lost, and the ankles are black and muddy. Because of the speed of running, the hem of the princess dress was torn by her. Big cut, revealing the calf's calf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three." The orc girl listens calmly, and is sensitive to the senses of the extraordinary mortal, let her know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three other pursuers. Half encircled to come to his own hidden place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bit her nails, wondering why she added the speed to her maximum. Also can't you chase after the soldiers? The girl is a little violent, but the wild instinct tells her that the strength of the comers is not weak. In the case of one-on-three, it is difficult to win without injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia is very afraid of pain, in the past battle, a little wound, can make her lose courage. The girl was crying and sulking, looking up at an apartment building not far away, and her body was turned into a shadow. I smashed the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minutes later, in the place where she had just hidden, the three figures were approaching carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Already ran."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The energy response of the Blood Knight badge shows that the enemy is there Nearby. Not far away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The speed of the other side is very fast. We don't even have time to see it. It should be an agile dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In general, John is not a weak hand. However, there is no chance of rebellion. It can be inferred from his body. The enemy also has the talent to absorb energy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the depths of the alley, There was a group of shadows that moved, which allowed the three blood knights to pursue their defensive postures immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small mouse that didn’t know where to drill, seemed to be frightened by lightning, screaming to re-enter the hole in the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn mouse." They sighed and continued to whisper, "continue to catch up, but don't rush to wait, wait for support."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the disappearance of the figure, the gray-haired mouse sneaked out of the head, suddenly sneezing, like a cat-like, bowed up, licking the water on the fur "Is the dragon pulse now mass-produced? How did I meet four at a time?" The mouse raised his paw and bounced off a piece of mud that had dried up on the beard. "Forget it, don't ask for trouble, I will come to Tantin, too. Just to find the old Bury to collect debts, the embarrassing old thing, as a court adviser, but still not paying back ten grams of fine gold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mouse Take a small step and sneak into the street. "It's so cold, why didn't the carriage pass?" It groaned. "Who said that the mouse is useless, at least along the way, I saved hundreds of fares, and I don't know how to open source and reduce expenditure. It’s not a good alchemist.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an old-fashioned old apartment building with damp wooden floors in the shade , Exudes a faint musty. Cecilia stayed in the corner of the hallway and played a red badge with her fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She narrowed her eyes and smacked her nose and carefully smelled it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hah, you are a bad thing in the ghost." The girl made a strange face to the badge. "No wonder how I can’t get rid of it." Her palm emerged. The group jumped, like a wild, green mist, covering the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A little bit of energy, it's not fun." Cecilia said savvyly, like throwing garbage, throwing it away. "It's safe now." She smirked her tail and drilled out from the window at the end of the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she braved the rain and returned to the big man's house, she stayed at home and waited for the news of the head of the barui, glared at the red eyes, cheering and running over, holding the girl and screaming, "clumsy" I must fight your ass, how dare to go out alone, what to do with bad guys."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia buried her head in the head of the head, Satisfy the stomach, eat enough to do exercise, and help digestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smelled the mother-like taste of Barry, listened to her blame, suddenly raised her face and kissed the head of the group. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Auntie, you are very good, I like you the most." Orc gimmicks very seriously promised, "Whoever bullies you, I ate him." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little guy, hungry, I am going to give you a hot dish." Barrie certainly wouldn't think of it. The true meaning of the word "eat". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia sat cross-legged in the chair, and cleaned the hot cocoa from the apex, waiting for the day and night of pure food before going to bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satiate and drink, occasionally go out to hunt, always have a warm quilt and gentle care of the adults, the girl is extremely satisfied with the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone dares to destroy her happy life, Cecilia will definitely let the bad guys know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the king-level dragon anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran's carriage was at a crossroads in the old district and was blocked by a patrolman inspected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Please show your ID." The patrolman said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened, I have encountered three inspections along the way." Fran pushed the window roots on the car and will be issued by the Justice Department. The special pass was handed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kasimodo Berk, consultant of the Justice Department." The patrolman read the name of the document. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This certificate was given to him by Peggy. In the name, Fran was the private consultant of the Missy, but because of the short time, the trust was limited. He has never been able to break into the core circle of Peggy's power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Knight Knight Advisor. There is a big case, we are searching for fugitives." The patrolman gave a tribute and answered in an unclear manner. In fact. He did not know what happened tonight. He only knew that someone was murdered at the execution ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, yes, I am looking for a missing girl, about thirteen years old, with orc blood." Fran puts the document back in his pocket, no Anxious to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Sorry, I am not responsible for this case, you can go home first, please trust the police station's ability to solve the case." The patrolman is a fool The bureaucratic material, the content of the reply is rigid and meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran nodded and wanted to continue to ask for some details. At this time, there was a noise in the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catch." In the distance, the patrolman’s colleague shouted to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a sharp voice. Even the torrential rain and the thunder of the sky seem to have been overwhelmed by it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You got it wrong!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran strangely put his head out, this sounds him It sounds familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilla Berry feels that he must have been cursed by fate in the near future, otherwise why is it so bad? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First lost his job, and was forced to stay in the detention center for a whole night. Today, when he is well at home, he is broken into the robbers. Scared to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I... I am unemployed at home, no money." She held the quilt and pityfully prayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't pretend, you can't run away." The man is holding a gray lacquered brooch, this is the blood knight in front of this woman's door. Found in his eyes, burning green and strange flames, "the dragons of the underground world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lila shook her head desperately, the dragon veins? She swears that she first heard of the term. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she was wearing pajamas and was forced to get out of the quilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The murderer who is not tracking is an ordinary person. But maybe there is a connection, take her back to the trial." The girl heard the "robbers" talking, she It was discovered that the identity of the robbers and the victims seemed to have reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You got it wrong!" She punched and kicked, but was dragged to the street in the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the apartment building, the black prison car, like a huge coffin, made the girl tremble with fear. The other residents who were awakened, opened the window and looked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that Miss Berry living at 203?" Someone recognized her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Heaven, something big." There were people watching the patrols of several preparations, surrounded the whole apartment, and it was not doubtful that the one looked beautiful and kind. Neighbor, what is the identity. Intrigue? Perverted murderer? Gangster female head? They talked through the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Lila can't wait to find a rope to hang himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, she saw a stopped carriage on the roadside, and a man stretched his head out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lightning flashed across the sky, the entire night sky, in an instant, trembling into white, she angered and recognized, is the profiteer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Casimodo Bo Knight, you are a disaster star! Every time I see you, I will be unlucky!" The girl twisted her head, both angry and wronged Shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan touched his forehead with a headache. "I will be unlucky to see you." He has seen dozens of patrolmen, turning their guns, far away. Surrounded the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people in the car immediately come down." The police ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fran watched the crowd with at least ten men different from the ordinary police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
