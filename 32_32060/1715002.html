			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The gangster’s head, Youni, came out of the club with a stiletto hat and a slender gold-plated cane in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight-faced physique bodyguards, who are close to him, are not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Godfather, Good Day." Just a few hundred meters from the gate to the carriage, there are no more than four people, bending over and holding his left hand, complimenting Kissed with respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yuni controls the underworld business in the three cities of the Gulf. Not long ago, the smuggling head Andrei lost his power. It was his first to start and ordered his men to rob Unsuccessful smuggling channels have succeeded in expanding the forces one step further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let my godson Jia Kai take charge of the new path." Youni thought while walking. "So, where is Jia Kai left, who is more suitable?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man with a bright smile on the road interrupted his thoughts. "You are the godfather of Youni." The young man said in a tone of affirmation rather than inquiry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, what's the matter?" Youni habitually reached out and was ready to accept another kiss. He had too many nominal sons. Remember everyone's appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Godfather." The young man politely said, "The sun is really hot today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yuni is inexplicable, subconsciously looking at the sky, there is no cloud, the light body on the clear sky is shining warmly, then, Uny's visual network model, occupied by the endless bright red, drama The pain made him feel like he was burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is indeed burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguards looked at the leader with stunned eyes and ignited on the side of the road, braving the smoke and turning into a human fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your, if you don't get the permission of the owner, you must take the punishment of others." The young man smiles, his eyes, can't see the pupil. Transparent is like dyeing a thin green glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gentlemen, I should choose a new leader and say hello to him for me." The young man said to the bodyguard, "The sinner is dead, the film king recognizes the rights of your gang, but you must be afraid of the shadow king."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the other side of the street, the bodyguards stood in the shadow of the building, no one dared to catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One o'clock in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the ten black market auctions is calculating the proceeds in private apartments and accountants. "Sir, the income this month is 270,000." Accounting said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black market auction head squinted and calculated quickly in the bottom of his heart, "Without the principal, there is a net income of 180,000." He thought happily, suddenly I heard a melodious music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What sound?" He asked the others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing." Others replied strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am too tired." The auction head knocked on his head. "You go back first, I take a break." He checked a single receipt. And Caesar, ready to lock them into the safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music continues to sing in the ear, and the tune is getting sad. It seems as if the ghost is muttering in another world. "Damn tinnitus, I have to go to a doctor tomorrow morning." He just wanted to lock the safe, but he stopped moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sense of uneasiness grows in your heart. "No, it's not safe to put it here." He gasped and looked around. He seemed to think that the walls, windows, and furniture carpet ceilings all had spy eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Money is mine! There are thieves!" He walked around in the room anxiously, feeling cold. The auction head is a financial fan, otherwise it will not be for the money, swallowed the old auctioneer Anderson gave him the auction goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road, Andersi is already dead, and the news has made him feel at ease. In fact, it has been a lot of days. No one came to ask him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, my money is dangerous! The auction head was red eyes, trying to find a safe place to hide the property. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he sat on the floor panting, his eyes staring straight at the open safe, and he had a good idea. He shuddered and grabbed a document and ate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden in the belly is the safest, no one can take it! He thought while eating. Gem, certificate, and gold Caesar, one can not be less, all through the stomach! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the rooftop of the apartment, a handsome, melancholy, artist-rich man, playing silent music, ten fingers Wrapped in a green light group, waving in the void, traversing a path of light green, as if not in front of the air, but a piano with exquisite workmanship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eat, vulgar, hell is with you." He smiled sarcastically. "This is the meaning of the king. Before we leave the bay," Let you know how to fear first. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I promised that you have never been guilty of your crimes. You can still be loyal to them, like a wolf-like lurking. No need to contact me unless necessary. If there is a key immigration intelligence, wait for the designated place at the appointed time, and Raymond is your guide. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no signature, just at the end of the document, with a delicate and compact seal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loretta brought a cup of steaming tea, and Fran folded the file and put it in his arms. It was found in the mezzanine of Igo Andech, and it was very clever.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is it for Andrei? And it is in the tone of the superior. And Joe Corleone, from the information collected, this killer belongs to The supernatural ability of the dragon pulse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, maybe he still has a group of followers of the same type.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;龙脉者! Fran knows this kind of person, which also means that he wants to revenge, he must be prepared more fully.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels very uncomfortable There was a lot of pain in the needles, and countless messy things rushed into my mind. Fran took his forehead and saw that Lauvita stood by and looked at him with concern.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb Sp; "Ms. Whiteman, you are my secretary, not..." Fran paused and waved, "...servant. You should have your own life. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, in fact, you don't need to mind that." Lauvita said, "Your tone is reminding me of what happened that day, the wound will heal, scar, and then disappear, please rest assured, my recovery ability is very strong." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you are right." Fran nodded. "What is Kregan doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "He is very honest these days. I seem to think that he is afraid of you." Lauvita replied, "Shawei had had a dispute with him, and the words seemed to mention the word dragon."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Longmai, does he know this too?" Fran slowly swallowed the tea, letting the taste of the cockroaches spread fully on the taste buds, "If you want, help me collect Let's take a bit of information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to go to Tantin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is this Conception." Fran looked at the porcelain cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the underground channel, Joe Corleone, the killer who betrayed Andrei, gave up the site of the Golden Horn Bay and disappeared. . Fran speculates that this is related to the gorse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next battlefield, in the capital city of Tantin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going there, finds the killer, finds the wild cat, and destroys a family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman who sits in the clouds and makes arrogant laughter, he wants her to fall from the clouds and fall heavily in the mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Peggy Don Leinschmann, waiting for me, you have the power and the future of others, freely rounded up, what? At least, go to hell with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The porcelain cup broke open, and Fran looked at his fingers that were blue and white because of force, and was cut by pieces. Injury, oozing a trace of blood, mixed with yellow brown tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else do you have?" Fran asked Lauvita. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray-eyed girl said with a sigh of relief, "I found myself seemingly strange...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
