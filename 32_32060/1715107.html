			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Fees are undoubtedly bustling, with its unique charm and style, wearing white gloves and gray uniforms, squatting in front of the shop, smiling waiters The fashion store cleans the window with a dazzling array of glamorous clothes; the layout is comparable to a small castle in a department store, dressed in elegant and fashionable ladies, coming in and out, full of blush after a crazy shopping; many barefoot children Every time I saw a private carriage stop, I swarmed and shouted. "Sir, do you need to clean the car? A piece of money, to ensure that your pony and tires are as clean as new." The patrol is not far away. Just a little glance, not like other cities, waving the batons to drive forward, Feidu people's philosophy, making money by their own hands, is worthy of praise and affirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From dawn to the early hours of the morning, the fees are always full of noise and vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the soft and radiant clouds are gradually eroded by the increasingly splendid eve, and a golden red light spreads across the horizon in the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl walks along the neat sidewalk, on a crowded street, her soft yellowish hair wrapped in a white plaid under the headband, a few 缕Playfully twisted out, the flexible green eyes shed a curious look, the goose-yellow silk satin shirt and the brown tight-leg pants make her and the ordinary people who passed by are no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first court did not get any information, after all, the fact that the custody appeared in court was confidential. After An Mei came out, I didn’t want to go back to the hotel and meet with Zall Law for a while, strolling aimlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the leather of Joe Corleone is cut, I can start living again and look for my lost memory. Well, maybe I There are family members, friends, what kind of things would they be?" The girl thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a bit stunned. In her mind, only the experience of murder and sin, only blood and tragic mourning, can satisfy her previous quest Stimulating heart. But now, there are strange feelings rising, and the more you stay in this city, the stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mood of the germination gradually stunned the girl’s heart, and she vowed not to remember that she had been to the city, but the sight of the land was revealed from the bones. Familiar with. Let her feel like she has lived here for ten years or even longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl stopped occasionally, knocking on her head, and wondering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it’s time to discuss with Zall Law, that smart old guy can speculate, no, An Mei quickly dispelled this idea, since even so My brother can turn her back and want to put her to death, then. Who else in this world is worth trusting? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now she and Zall Law are allies. But I can't be sure that I believe him completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a shopping street where people come and go, Anmei walked into a shopping mall and first bought a hand-carved cane with gold foil. She promised to send this stuff to Zall Law, the dragon of the underground world, who has always spoken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A street stall on the corner of the street attracted the girl’s gaze, a small food stall, bought boiled fish and pumpkin pie, and she saw the stall owner use it on the table. The knife cuts something cyan and then sprinkles it into the pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this seasoning." She went over and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The orange peel, the viscera of the fish is suffocating." The stall owner replied cheerfully, "Want to have a bowl, to ensure that it is fragrant."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl shook her head and was a plug. This damn fruit always reminds her of something vague. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head faintly hurts, the effectiveness of the pharmacy prevents her from continuing to dig into the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, she pushed the door of a tailor's shop and walked in. She looked at a piece of high-grade wool sample clothing on the display rack. Fingers pick up the thickness and material of the control cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mixed imitation wool velvet, the price is higher, at least cut the price of two." An Mei shouted, and then surprised why they know . The training she received in the organization was all about the ability to check, lurk, and kill, which did not include identifying the quality of the clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Is there a place where I can help?" The store owner enthusiastically greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too expensive." The girl frowned and answered the interface subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This shop is calculated according to the style. If you really want to be cheaper, we can exchange the silver sterling cuffs of the sleeves for silver plating..." The shopkeeper obviously will try to figure out the customer's wishes. "I don't know how big you have to do." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shadow appeared in his mind, and a string of figures suddenly came out of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One meter one tall one, lean, bust is..." The girl was stunned, she didn't understand why she said so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner looked at the young and beautiful lady inexplicably, and ran out pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei is like being suffocated in the water at the moment, feels suffocated, his thoughts are floating, his head is thundering like a thunder, she I even suspected that I had been attacked and was controlled by the dragon who could influence the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s ability is strong, but she is too weak in her will. After all, she was only an ordinary housewife a few years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She squatted toward a small square nearby, there was a little out of the way, there were not many pedestrians, only some women with children walking . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking for an empty bench, An Mei sat down and desperately wanted to restore calm, so I could filter my situation and sort out the clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who am I? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Coleon, the most famous dragon killer in the underground world. Maybe I have another name, but I don't know it yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is this? What am I doing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feidu, located in the big city of Golden Horn Bay, you are prepared to retaliate against the enemy who betrayed himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is he? Who is the shadow in the brain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams woke up the girl, and she saw a woman with heavy makeup, wearing exposed low-cut clothes, covering her mouth, pointing at herself like a ghost, and squatting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An Mei? You... are you dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know You?" she replied with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too much like it, it’s too much like it.” The woman stunned for a few breaths. "Sorry, I thought I saw a friend, God, me." It must be confused. She has long since passed away. It is impossible to live in front of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your friend, like me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like awesome!" The woman nodded affirmatively and muttered to her mouth. "Scared me, I just saw you, I thought the girl from I climbed out of the grave. Probably I didn't wake up yesterday, and made me confused."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she said, she swayed her head and turned to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please wait." An Mei shouted at her. "You made me curious. Can you tell me, is that girl who looks like me?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, miss, I am very busy, and, according to the rules, I have to charge, whether you want to have a special gameplay or just talk about it. Talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei understands her identity, a rogue that is caused by betrayal, but she is a "dead friend" in the woman's mouth. "very interested. This is an unexpected clue, perhaps to unlock your own confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One hundred pieces, cash." An Mei said, try to make the sound line calm, do not leak the violent fluctuations of inner feelings, "If you want to take this Money, ask what, you need to answer without concealing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, my good lady, this money is easy to earn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jasmine."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not like a real name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where do we continue to use the original name?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you working?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Golden Goose Tavern, as long as you find the Green Agate Square in the old town, you can see at a glance See the big signboard of the bar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, Miss Jasmine, tell me now, please let me know what happened to your friends."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The girl has a good relationship with me." A bart girl, how can she not think of it, the person who has died in memory, live and sit on her own In front of him, and the experience of several years, has changed the temperament of An Mei's whole person. The bright smile always hanging on his face has been replaced by gloom. "She is called An Mei, um, or she calls her Mrs. Flair. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Flair?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The name of her husband, that is a very Promising, prestigious The man, in the first aristocratic court, served as a prosecutor. You know, like a man, you just play with us, but he just stunned An Mei, hey, why didn’t I come across such a good person, then the store All the sisters in the room are envious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened later?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I don't know the specific situation. I only know that Mr. Flair seems to have offended the big man, lost his job, and later died. It is said to have been murdered. It is said that the murderer has not let go of the dog." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information on the tragedy of the murder was not even known in the memorandum of the patrol hall. The police did not find much valuable clues and could only be listed as pending cases. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei listens, has been thinking about this real story, deep inside, as if there is a mouth spring is touched, it seems that there are countless pictures with the spring spewing Come out, it’s too late to see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, touch my ass again, I will smash your head with an iron plate." She dressed in a female uniform, sullen towards a wretched The sailor is shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
