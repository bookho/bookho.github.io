			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Fei Yi Li Lisi sat quietly in the chair in the center of the cathedral library, the afternoon sun passed through the skylight of the dome, but the hall was tall The bookshelves, the dark curtains and the faint smell of ink in the air make the library still dark. Good sound insulation makes it like a dead world, four-story shelves, small ladders for people to pick up books, those lying on bookshelves, precious books, and zenith murals, always silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The square table is full of books, "On the Holy Song", "Abyss Devil Research", "The Origin and Change of Morning Prayer Ceremony", "Father in Heaven", etc. Classic church work... She gently closes the ancient yellowed "praise!" "The first print, I feel like vomiting. This book has been seen more than a dozen times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have to watch, she must deepen the boring words in her mind, not to be diluted by time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Matilda Hepburn, known as the Flower of the King’s Hall, the head of the sad cross, Li Lisi, and the mascots of other knights, It is considered to have no personality. In battle or banquet, you only need to follow the beautiful vase that smiles behind others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference is Li Lisi’s memory. She can recite more than 300 hymns without thinking, opening a page of any church book. She can continue to carry on her back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the eyes of the outside world, this talent does not make sense. Li Lisi still remembers that when she was ten years old, His Majesty the Pope visited the early years of the seminary. When she was scrutinized for her homework, she stood up and took the contents of the seventy-three rules in the face of the whole class clearly and unmistakably. When she came out, the distinguished pope touched her head and praised, "It is a sincere good boy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a sincere good boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the praise of the Pope, even the most severe theological teacher, when she saw her, her expression was softened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students are surrounded by her, Li Lisi is like the most proud princess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Matilda Hepburn was half-year old and she was an inconspicuous yellow-haired girl. Stay in a double bedroom with yourself. Often because of the lack of homework, the punishment is beaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Ma Tida’s hand was sorely painful. When she was buried in the quilt, Li Lisi always ran quietly to the kitchen, stealing the apple, and letting this clumsy head break into laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, give it to you. Less crying, really noisy, I still want to sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you." The clumsy head squinted at the apple, and the dirty face still had tear marks on her face, and she looked at her with a crisp smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, in the devout to the cruel theological school, Lilith felt that taking care of Matida was a very interesting thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this beautiful life, such as the delicate and fragile thin porcelain vase, was easily broken. When clumsy is found to have the talent to learn magic. After waking up to the dragon pulse, everything has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the students of the theological class, in the glory of Matilda Hepburn as the wings of the glory of angels. They all look dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spirit and Dragon!", "Miracle!", "The genius of the King's Hall in a hundred years!" Whether it is Cardinal, Archbishop, or Mercy and Mercy The Pope does not despise his own praise. In the seminary, like the story of Swan Princess Matilda pure, on the crown of the head of the most dazzling pearl, while small, only outstanding point of Li Lisi memory than the common people, like the ugly duck hiding in the shadows, A tiling around the pearl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the junior class graduation ceremony, Li Lisi holds an excellent paper. I thought that he would usher in attention and applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that day, the damn Matilda successfully summoned the Holy Flame for the first time. To preside over the ceremony the Archbishop, he shocked his lips trembling, to get the message heresy presiding judge in black robes and dark hall Hall bishop, even to this day Houmadida where the inauguration, on the spot triggered a spat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is confused and surprised for a girl who can only play with fire, no one remembers, Li Lisi's perfect score. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the summoning of the flames! It was only the most lame stray poet, fooling the villagers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trick of deceiving money! Standing in the corner, the forgotten Li Lisi shouted in her heart, and her eyes were red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ceremony, Li Lisi hid in the back garden of no one and silently wept. And Matida held a lot of apples and found her happily. He ran to the front and said, "This is what the bishop gave me, and I gave it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Li Lisi threw the apple, along with the shredded papers, into the sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her heart, there is no friendship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even after the tradition, and also as the head of the Knights, Ma Tida’s men respected her. And Li Lisi didn't even have the right to mobilize half of the holy warriors. "Miss head, don't interrupt, if it's not tradition, in the group, you are a burden." When there is any resolution, they always disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嫉妒, like a wildfire, swallow the girl, and there is no bone residue left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't tell anyone about Martina's presence in Tanding." Lilith thought, the necklace on her chest was distributed by the Holy See to each The equipment of the Knights mascot can detect nearby magical fluctuations. "The hybrid, who left the church a few years ago to do a knight tour, has never returned, has missed the resurrection, and attracted the displeasure of the Pope. If I Adding a fire can give her a good look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my own glory, she must take it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byron, September 13th, Saturday, at noon, Liujin Street is an emerging business district in Tanding, with each street-facing house hanging in front of the door. The aluminum signboard of a small private enterprise or a large business office, from the east to the west, the number of the house number is the famous hospital doctor's private clinic, and the second is Michael Brothers Construction Engineering Company, mainly responsible for prison engineering, 3 No. is the value of Bauer... Fran stopped before the 64th.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a brown-red brick wall, quite old The pattern of the house and the combination of paint and gravel on the wall has been faintly blurred. The green ivy has been energetically crawling over the wall. Some of the letters on the door have been peeled off, which reads “Rickey Fruit Import and Export Corporation”. Words.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the room, it is very empty, the floor is covered with a layer of ash, behind the house is not a big lawn, the musty smell in the house The sun falling on the green grass is intertwined.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This belongs to Mr. Richard's industry, but he is currently on the verge of bankruptcy, eager to take over the property to pay off the debt." With a black briefcase, following the real estate economy behind Fran, "the appearance is worn out." But the location and the interior of the building are very good, you only need to decorate a little." If Fran interrupted the economy, he wrote a series of numbers on the cheque. "In two days, all the procedures will be completed."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Knights of the Buildings." Flanders for their own engineering projects, registered companies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He broke up on the main street after breaking up with the real estate economy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the sun sank and the stars flashed in the night sky like the ink, Fran returned home. Since that night, he found that after someone had entered his room, he had always suspected that someone in the family had spy on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is Barry or Cecilia, there is reason to explain, the head always wants to find opportunities to understand his past, and the orc girl, when hungry I will find food everywhere. But if it is Ma Tida, it is the worst thing. At the very least, the girl’s intelligence has recovered to some extent and is feeling uneasy about her situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he did a small test today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the table, a plate of cold and cold meals, and a note, written by Barry:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went back to the troupe, and there were performances in the day after tomorrow. Cecilia also took it away. Little Matida felt sleepy after eating and was sleeping. After you came back, remember to heat the dishes. Then eat again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put down the note and went straight to the second floor to open the bedroom door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to the safe is still lying under the pillow, as if no one has ever moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the side of the cabinet door, the wax stain that he deliberately left, no longer exists, someone opened it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan turned and walked to the room of Matida. In front of the door, he checked the bullets in the pistol and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is not asleep, lying half on the bed, her skin is like a ceramic doll, pale and showing a pathological luster. See him, shouting, "Father, you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand placed outside the quilt, on the right hand, has a yellow-green dirt. Fran took a few deep breaths. He applied some colorless potion on the key. If it was stained to the skin, it turned from transparent to yellowish green after half an hour, and it was difficult to clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mentally handicapped girl will know how to turn the key out of the pillow and open the safe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you eat, you sleep, you will gain weight." He tried to make his look look sly and sat down on the bed. "You grew up, it used to be Calling my dad, I won’t use your name.” Fran sees, and Ma Dida’s face is white for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to drink water?" He looked like nothing, walked over to the cupboard, filled the glass with water, and in his pocket, there was A pack of powdered potions is made at the maximum concentration. The effect is not aphrodisiac but a paralysis of the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create a tragedy: The poor daughter died of a heart attack. It will not cause anyone's suspicion, and the authoritative autopsy officer will not be able to detect the toxins from the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida seems to be sneaking a sigh of relief, picking up the cup and slamming the water clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's sleep well." Fran said, he patted the girl's small head, covered the quilt for her, and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do with her?" In the hallway, Fran thought that he was not poisoned in the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still remembers his promise, "There is nothing more than three." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot judge others on the basis of crimes that have not yet occurred. This is the spirit of the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least for now, Matida has not shown the intention to completely restore her memory and want to kill herself again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to think of a way to keep her state going." Fran remembered one thing, in the Western Court, Heber Darmack I used to control Madida with drugs, and let this girl be like a puppet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a lot of plants with paralytic nerve function." Fran tapped his finger on the corridor and brushed the red painted railing to make Decide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
