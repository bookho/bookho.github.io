			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The ugly face almost made Lila scream, "Cassimodo Bo Knight, her eyebrows, the heart beats violently, even breathing They are all in a hurry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you get along with this disaster star. Even in a sanatorium on the outskirts of Tantin, you will meet him. This damn fate is worth it. Cursed in the name of the abyss demon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would rather date the most unpretentious man of Tantin than to be attacked by the disaster star. Lila didn't think so hard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought about the word "daughter" that she just heard. There is only one patient in the entire nursing home, but she does not believe in life and death. Ma Tida has a kinship relationship with the ugly profiteer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t be angry, just when he doesn't exist, I am doing care now, I must remember to keep smiling. "The girl deliberately went to the side door, so that it was staggered with the disaster star.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the left corridor is the ward of Matilda, when she passed by, the head nurse I happened to walk out of the ward and saw Lila, and told him, "Mr. Bo is visiting the patient. The temperature test around two o'clock is temporarily canceled. Come back at four o'clock. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is...a relative of Miss Matilda? Lila asked questions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You still don't know, the gentleman is the owner of the nursing home and the father of the lady." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was actually working for the most annoying people! Lila took the dried linen and went to the locker room with frustration and began to consider whether to resign. However, she was reluctant to leave the beautiful environment near the sanatorium, and she could not bear the poor little Matida. Moreover, because the secret police arrested the security department last time, the landlord would rather compensate the liquidated damages and rushed to cancel the lease.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has no home in Tanding.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I work really hard, get the salary I deserve It is not because of his favor, why should he resign? Finally, Lila convinced herself and compromised with reality. She looked at the wall clock.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the arrangement, at three o'clock, I went to the kitchen to prepare afternoon tea; At four o'clock, you must measure the body temperature for Matilda; before you leave work, you should also organize your nursing report today.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl soon abandoned the shadow of the profiteer from her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At four o'clock, she went to the medical room first and took the thermometer from the thick plush box. Carefully held, this is a delicate thing made of glass and mercury. It is worth a lot of money. It was invented a few years ago based on modern medical theory, but only those who are really rich can afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ward, the Quasimodo Bo Knight has left, and Matilda, as usual, sat in a chair and heard someone coming in, Turned indifferently. His eyes are scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The amount is warm. Hey, raise your arm a little." Lila smiled affectionately, and touched Ma Dida with his shoulders. White gold hair on the ground. Untie her coat and put the body temperature under the girl's armpit. "Clamp, it will be five minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said a few words I began to clean up the house and put away the cup in the air on the table. There were two cigarette butts on the ground. This made Lila sigh a few times. "How to be a father, the patient smells the smoke. It is not good for the body." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she turned her cigarette but turned around, she was stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medida holds the thermometer on his hand as if it were a colored pencil, slamming it on the paper, and Lila is too late to stop it. The fragile glass bursts, and a large drop of mercury rolls down on the table, forming a lot of finer beads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Lila is not a nurse who has received formal medical training. Also know that mercury is poisonous. She stared blankly and then gave a sharp scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't panic, take some sulphur powder, and sulphur can neutralize mercury and stop it from evaporating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head nurse who heard the cry came over and calmly told her that she used a spoon to carefully remove the mercury beads that had penetrated the clothes of Matida, and then asked very seriously, "When the thermometer is broken. Is there mercury in the mouth of the lady?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I didn't pay attention..." Lila was at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are you responsible! Only after working for a few days, there is such a serious accident!" the head nurse screamed angrily. "In order to prevent accidents, prepare egg whites immediately." And emetics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire sanatorium was as chaotic as the market, until Martida spit out the residue in the stomach, and the signs did not show mercury poisoning before it subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Berry caregiver, you are doing good deeds." The head nurse called Lila to the dean's room. "There has never been such a consequence in this hospital." It’s an unimaginable accident.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sorry...” The girl turned her head in uneasiness, and she felt that she had to lose her job again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't I really stand up in the big city? Lila sorrowfully thought that she was waiting for the arrival of the verdict. If she made a mistake, she would have to be punished. There is nothing to defend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although you have serious faults." Sighed and looked at the young girl kindly. "But the opportunity to make up for it is a virtue. Even if it is, but you can't make mistakes again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promise!" Lila screamed ecstatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I walked into the ward again, the girl saw the little Matida, still sitting by the window, she walked over quickly, and the thunder said, "I'm sorry, I don't. I know if you can understand me, but really, I am sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An answer to her is an indifferent face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is not aware of what happened in the nursing home. He came in a hurry and walked very quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to prevent the dangerous Santa Warrior girl from doing something wrong, he deliberately increased the weight of the spiritual agent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One year, give me a year, wait for the gorse to wither, sinners find a good place in hell, I will restore your senses. Fran felt a little guilty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He admires the law, because it is the embodiment of justice in the human world, but hatred forces him to use his sinful means to dig graves for the enemy. Contradictory thoughts are always entangled in the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse ran very fast, running in the countryside outside Tantin, and when he was close to the hour of dinner, he returned to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
