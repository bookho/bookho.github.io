			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town’s people got up early, the passing pedestrians on the road, there were many plays of the Cardinals, they saw Fran, took off their hats, nodded Salute, a driver, apparently still addicted to the plot can not extricate themselves, deliberately stopped the carriage, the whip in the hand as a sword, the tip is down, the left hand presses the right chest, and a knight ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our knight." They all said that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan let the mounts walk along the uneven bluestone road with small steps, one by one, which makes the townspeople very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of the road is the church of Dawn Fort, and Fran stopped in front of the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t count on the beauty of the town’s churches, the chapels are very simple and intimate, the windows are stone, and the ordinary craftsmen of the craftsmanship engraved some rough flower carvings. The white glass window took a little thought, using light paint to outline the colored leaves, tangled tangled vines and religious flavors, so that when the sun shines in, it can form a magnificent glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smog gradually smog, the faint white smoke, in the hurricane, it seems to dance the dance of the monks, and the thin bell tower that the eaves extends, that The bells of blessing seem to be playing meticulously for this frivolous dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awareness affects the body, Matilda sleeps like a child, old Marlow Southwest is panting, the fur can wipe out the water, Fran is enough Heavy, and now add a big girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the horse can talk, he may now scream and scream, "Is it a big boy?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hepburn, wake up." Fran took care of the girl's knotted hair with her fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida squinted, "Dad, where is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Church, Let's do the morning prayer.” Fran said, carefully observing her reaction. Matilda looked curiously at the stone carvings on both sides of the church steps, and turned to look at Fran innocently laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mad believers are generally trained from an early age, but she does not have this memory." Fran thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church has only one hall, steps on the seven steps, pushes open the door, and there are narrow aisles in the two rows of wooden chairs. There is a small leather mat in front of each chair, and the back of the chair is nailed. A short, thick wooden table, when massing, people can lie on the mat and place their arms on the wooden bench at the back of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up, there is no exquisite ceiling, you can directly see the wooden ribs like the branches of the big trees, the ribs, hanging with light Printed banner banner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the innermost mass stage, the holy emblem of the sword hammer is high, and Fran leads the girl and picks a chair. "Will you read the morning prayer?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matida shook his head. "What is that? Can you eat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no trace of impurities in the big eyes. Unlike camouflage, she really never lived in the Holy See, and she remembered the slightest memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then read it with me. If you cry, you will cheer in the morning, sleep in the dust, wake up and sing..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a cry, I will cheer in the morning, sleep in the dust, wake up and sing..." Matida smiled and then impatiently Jumping into the chair, screaming at the banner that wandered around his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When preparing to leave, the shrine of the church just came out of the side hall. "This member of the church, you want to pray, or prepare to go to the confession room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Dear Sir, I am not a believer in the Light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you Believe in what to teach, forgive my offense, those hypocritical..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am an atheist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"God, people without faith are sad, please believe that the mind is not calm, don't you feel pain and confusion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He can't be a transcendent saint, and by praying, he can extinguish the boiling and angry magma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An eye for an eye." This Eastern vengeful thinking can be called the worldly beings, wishful and satisfying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your concern." Fran answered coldly, and he called Matilda to leave. It was just a test for her. Fran didn't want to have a time bomb around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With strong excitement and past scenes, an amnesia can be found in the lost past, in case one day, the samurai suddenly recovers, then he Have to face the horrible pale flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl did not respond to him, and Matilda did not know when to hide under the chair and trembled like a cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid, Dad." The girl reached out and pulled Fran's trousers and whimpered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and put Ma Dida on the back of Luo Nantes, Fran sees the old horse can not pay the weight of two people, they take the reins, in front Lead the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to you?" Fran asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad, the flag with the sword hammer is terrible, I am so scared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That is the symbol of the church, and what is terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I saw it, I remembered it...red..." The girl suddenly Screaming, "a lot of blood..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook, almost fell off the horse, Fran gave her a coat, comforted for a while . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This girl, what happened in her childhood?" Fran wiped the tears of Matida, "Fear of the church's flag? Blood? This It’s not a fanatical believer, the deep-rooted devout subconscious, there should be some reaction.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold-plated rose door, the cardinal caravan is ready, the members are burning Ass moved to the car and moved the object. "Big man, it is your strength, help." Nicole cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Their father and daughter just reunited, give more free time, wait for the big things that will not move, I am looking for workers to help." I took Nicole and turned to smile at Fran. "Casimodo, go to the room and don't miss something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My horse is also on the caravan, and, please, take care of her." He pushed Matida to Barry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My father is coming back soon." Matilda was a bit reluctant, but immediately, the candy that was given to her by the head attracted attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole whispered, "To protect the big man, God, the woman who is in love is terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor of the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put the suitcase with the money and the dressing clothes in the suitcase with the code lock, Fran looks at the bulge of the finger, thinking Have to find some free time, with verification to see if you can change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troupe can better cover his identity, but at the same time loses a lot of private space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are advantages and disadvantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bedside table is decorated with a small vase, the flowers inside have withered, and the hotel will be replaced in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullan reached out and gently stroked the withered petals, "live over." He ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was dumbfounded and confused for his own actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a resurrection of things that are gone, that is the function of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day the Salvation girl can be saved, presumably the holy magician of the samurai, attracting the energy of the sacred objects in her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to learn magic and study how to use the grace of the holy things? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before or not, optics will have the lowest level of magic, it will take many years, legal genius, does not mean that it is a theological genius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, to master the premise of the magic, you must have considerable piety, an atheist, able to perform magic, is a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
