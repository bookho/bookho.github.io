			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Moer came out of the Golden Goose Tavern. At this time, the sleet had been spent for a whole day, and the whole fee was like a woman who had just been happy, wet and tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is already deep, there is no star, and there are countless raindrops that are constantly leaking from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it’s a noisy city, it’s noisy, and it’s gradually fading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mamo, who had just walked through the Green Agate Square, stopped at the corner of the street, and looked at the skirt he had just bought with a dimly lit magical street lamp. The beautiful layered skirt is already stained with a few mud spots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn weather." Ma Moer complained, carefully wiping it with his fingers, but only allowed the dirty dirt to get bigger and bigger, which made Her brows are getting deeper and deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dress is one of her popular secret weapons for a part-time female. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever knows, Ma Moer is the most famous signature girl in the Golden Goose Tavern, when she comes to a dance on the wine table, men Excited howls can almost knock the roof over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there will be an alcoholic, say a few words to the boss, and then quietly stuffed a few silver Italians, bought in the bar upstairs In the small room, she stayed alone for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally two quarters of an hour, sometimes longer, in Mamo’s purse, there will be more “squeaky” things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few more years, you can buy a two-story house with a backyard on the outskirts of Feidu, or go to a farther place to find a The man at this point is married. Every time Ma Maer goes to sleep, she always counts today's income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cleaning fee for this high-grade skirt that cannot be washed will delay her dream for several more days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when the man approached her, Mamo decided to do another business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint light made Mamo unable to see the man's appearance, but the long-legged shoes on his feet that were slamming on the road, the slender cane on his hands, and the carriage behind him all hinted that the man bought I can afford her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a gentleman, then she may go to the expensive and stalwart hotel on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Mo has only been there once, half an year ago, an old aristocrat, bought a whole night with a golden chase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles certainly wouldn’t go to the small room upstairs, so she was taken to the palace – for Mamo, the luxury decor of that hotel, and There is no difference in the palace she imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the old guy’s soft stuff made Mamo’s tongue work hard for a night, he was satisfied and satisfied, at the cost of his own shirt. The next day it was sour and hemp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Ma Mo still misses the feeling of rolling on a bed covered with soft feather mats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;舔舔 Your own plump and sexy lips, Ma Moer leaned against the pillars of the street lamp, gently rotating the umbrella handle, trying to lengthen himself The body-building legs are exposed from under the skirt, the tall chest, proudly depicting a great curve under the clothes. It’s not bad to seduce a man’s effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Ma Moer regretted his greed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a man raises the hand that has been hidden behind him, the cold light that flashes the sharp knife under the light is called the stunned eyes of Ma Moer. Frightened and desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncontrollable pain smashed all thoughts and perceptions, and soon she knew nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrol team’s inspector, Lyme Knight, received the report in the early morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grayish white mist makes the Green Agate Square look awkward. This old square, some years old, was blocked by a team of patrolmen. From time to time, the residents who got up early, curiously came over and wondered what happened, and they were immediately repelled by the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyme slowly uncovered the black cloth that was placed on the body. The headless body appeared in front of him and was a very good girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the cold, the blood has not completely solidified, and the wet road surface is stained with a thick red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hurry up and find out her identity." Lyme told his subordinates, and after a pause, he looked at the slutty skirt and added, "Go to the bar." Asked the rogue street, who is missing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purse found from the corpse was smashed, listening to the crisp sound of the collision between the Olympics and the copper. Lyme whispered a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are limbs broken every time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incisions of each corpse are neat and uncluttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The valuables carried by the victim are not lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the guy has appeared again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midnight butcher, this is the name of the guy inside the patrol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the fee is a little less than the Thousand Towers Mystery and beauty; perhaps the fee is more than the eternal king of the city, but a bit of a singularity and atmosphere, but even the most widely traveled poet, can not deny that the city fees are the ones they have seen, the most wonderful city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chill of winter is like a layer of heavy fog hugging the whole city, the sky is gray and can't see the sun, the thick and bleak clouds finally break open at noon. After a few days of rest, the rain that lasted for a few days was woven into a silver-like rain curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Fryer stood in the stone hall of the apartment and complained about the ghost weather. This is a slender young man with his mouth always tight. A thin line, the brown pupil with the hair makes him appear slightly indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the words in the proverbs, it is a natural "cold face." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fryer, it’s a handsome guy, it looks too cool." Many girls said so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad weather makes Feidu’s transportation industry surprisingly tight, a car carrying a passenger’s car is flowing, the wheels will smash the muddy water, the coachman Unrestrainedly maneuvering the car to avoid obstacles and fly on the road that is not too spacious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dilapidated carriage stopped in front of Fran, "Gregory, where are you going?" the groom said respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no such thing as a poor private carriage, and fell to the Lord who lived in the old town. The people who live here are kindly tolerant. After all, there is a real aristocratic residence around you, which is always something that makes people feel proud. What's more, this Sir Alex is polite and has a different culture and demeanor than the civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to the Golden Goose Tavern, trouble you." Fran pulled the handle outside the carriage and stepped onto the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car was driving very steady, but the cold rain was mixed with ice particles from the broken rim of the car, and Fran chilled and lifted the collar up. Raised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, the destination is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red roof, the exaggerated big signboard, the loud noise of the drunkards constantly coming out of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golden Goose Tavern is probably the most lively place on Green Agate Street, where there are cheap and delicious beers, passionate girls, and the most famous small rooms. Although vulgar, every normal man can find his own fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran took out a silver Olympics from the purse and handed it to the coachman, watching him change his pockets and find the change, the red and swollen hands were full Frostbite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not for a livelihood, who would like to come out and get sin in the cold weather? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran couldn’t bear to wave his hand and signal that the driver didn’t have to change. Then he turned and walked up the two-step step and pushed open the red lacquered wooden door of the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub is very warm, Fran has a little stiff body, nod to several acquaintances who say hello to him, toward the oriental group in the corner The merchant gathered the table and walked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Feidu is at the border, a hundred years ago, through the raging sea of ​​death, the Mamouk merchants carrying a fleet of valuable cargo quickly made this Bianque fishing village the most prosperous of the entire Byron Empire. Commercial city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connecting the East and West, the first stop in the West, known as the Spice Channel, is Feidu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glass, spices, condiments, and many rarities that have never been heard before, as long as they can be transported without loss, they can be exchanged immediately. Ten times the profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peppers and wool produced here are shipped in the same way, and you can get enough rewards for any greedy businessman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why countless businessmen are rushing to risk their lives and returning to the two places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden Corner Bay, merchants use this rich name to name this straight and wide estuary in which Feidu is located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You...well, I am the client, Fran." Fran stuttered and greeted them in an oriental language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the business people with a little vigilant look, Fran took out a note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Arif, the most powerful big man who turned to the Spice Channel, and opened his bill of lading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A businessman who appeared to be the leader took over the bill of lading and carefully licked it, revealing a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this particular customer, they have heard about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always asks for some weird plants, even some roots or leaves, although it’s not a rare grass, it’s very troublesome to collect. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So only the big caravans like Ahmad will accept his order. To a large extent not for making money, but for the reputation of the first businessman on the Spice Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no spot, you will be charged half of the deposit and will be picked up the next time you return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After paying the rest of the payment, the merchant returned to the room and, after a moment, handed him a bulging lambskin bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the things inside, Fran not only waited for four months, but also took out a whole twenty golden meanings, which is enough for an ordinary family. Worried life for half a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for the sale of a sheet metal frame left by his father, Fran wouldn’t really ship the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the lambskin bag tied to the waist, Fran found a space against the wall, ordered a beer, and looked at the businessman who was still whispering. After a toasting gesture, they snorted in a small mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory, I haven’t seen you for a few days." Who is attached to Fulan’s ear and screams, a slippery thing flying fast on his earlobe The shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After frightened, Fran, who almost knocked over the glass, discovered that a blonde young woman stood behind him silently and smiled like Only a sly kitten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a vibrant girl, and the two green eyes like the most agate are always flashing and loving, and the tiny faint spots are around the bridge of the nose. Make the whole person more playful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An Mei, don't scare people." Fran waved his hand in a good mood, pulled out the handkerchief and wiped the beer that had just splashed on the cuffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? So beautiful." An Mei quickly grabbed the handkerchief, carefully looked at the lily pattern and lace embroidered side, and then put it in the room I have my own pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franland shrugged helplessly, and in front of this little wild cat, could not come up with anything delicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoke box with silver foil, beautiful lighter, chic collar buckle... I don’t know how many gadgets, so I changed my master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of almost ruthless robbery is a small game that he and An Mei often play, and also a symbol of their familiarity. Fran is also very happy to give her some small gifts in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter, think about me?" An Mei hung around Fran's neck and sighed in his ear. "If you go to small now." Room, but ask for money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not a good thing now, but I still have to work in the afternoon." Fulan pulled out a black chest emblem engraved with Tianping, and swayed toward Anmei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei’s beautiful green eyes excitedly screamed at Fran with his body. “Are you up to the prosecutor?” she screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now it’s just a trainee, but there are a few more lawsuits, I believe that it is not far from formal." Fran confidently showed off, infected with An Mei Joy, his heart is also very warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, in the interest-based fee, I really bless him, and only this girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran's family is a noble family that has been declining since a long time ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the grandfather’s Viscount, to the father’s baron, when passed to him, there is no industry in the family except for the lowest Lord’s title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why he sold his ancestral home and moved to the old district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father who had a lot of research on the law wrote a lot of notes during his lifetime. After reading this, Fran was barely helped by a distant relative. The court found a job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the age of sixteen to twenty-three, in seven years, Fran has already mastered the Code and accumulated a lot of experience. Sometimes, some senior judges have to rely on him to sneak a hint at the content of the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Living Code of the Seventh Chamber," everyone called him so affectionately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this cleverness, his position rose again, from the first recorder to the clerk to the prosecutor. If you make a proper ruling for several lawsuits, Fran believes that the word "training" will be removed soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the pub is snoring, remember to pick me up." An Mei's pretty little blush, she said with a playful little nose, "Send you a piece." Gifts to congratulate, free of charge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan knows what the free gift that has been given to him many times, many lonely nights, that soft and beautiful The gift, in his dilapidated little apartment, ignited enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
