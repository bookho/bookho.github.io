After a quarter of an hour, the girl fell to the ground and gasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It lasted for five minutes more than yesterday." After half a ring, Lauvita was relieved, and the head was placed on the bone to crack and muscle strain. Very effective, but can not exceed the limitations of **, can walk, but once running or jumping, you will feel powerless. "I can't pull my hind legs." The girl grinned and stood up and walked toward the bathroom. The hot water should be burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bath is indeed a kind of comfortable enjoyment, Lauvita lies in the bathtub, slightly closed eyes, the morning sun through the gaps in the bathroom blinds, in the rippling The water's hot air is lingering with the white skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took more than half an hour until the slightly hot water cooled, and she stood up from the water and wrapped her body with a long towel. Let the damp hair lie behind the back, take out the medicine, and cover the black scar on the left side of the thigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope not to leave unsightly scars." The girl will tie the clean new bandage, open the door, walk to the study, and put it on the desk from Fran. In the silver foil cigarette case in the drawer, I took a slender cigarette and licked it into my mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kitchen downstairs heard the sound of meat chops and eggs sizzling in a frying pan. "The big breasts are coming down early today, but to be honest, except for the individual dishes, her craftsmanship is very poor." Lauvita thought that the head of Barry Silana had come again, licking her mouth and holding it. Go down the stairs of the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you leave the brain aside, from the aesthetic point of view, Lauvita privately admits that Barrie is really beautiful, especially the chest, and the surging can make The men are lost. And those natural movements, full of mature female charms of the body movements. I can't learn how to do it myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of the woman made the girl resentful and resentful. She subconsciously touched her chest, raised her brow, sat down on the sofa and took a sip. The smell of smoke and dry smoke made her throat very uncomfortable. It was hard to believe that she could smoke two bags on the first day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful. Don't let hot oil splash on your body." After adjusting for a while, Lauvita played the role of a friendly sister and shouted with a smile. "Don't fry the eggs this time."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I can't match the standard of the restaurant chef, I can't handle fried eggs and fried meat sticks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lavetta stunned the smoke, threw it away, and walked into the kitchen. She saw that Fran was skillfully dicing the meat into slices, putting it into breadcrumbs and breaking the eggs. Roll and throw it into the pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head. Are you coming back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" just returned. I am catching up with breakfast. "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s going well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the back is facing, Lloyd The tower didn't see Fran biting his teeth, and there was a hint of confusion in his eyes. He quickly returned to calm, "very smooth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But fingerprints, I mean even Igo Andech’s fingerprints must be faked, will it Too cautious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The details determine success or failure, just like cooking, putting more or less salt, the taste is very different." Fran looked at the frying pan, After the meat pieces turn golden brown in the boiling oil, use a colander to pick up the oil and dry the residual oil. Sprinkle with diced green onion, ginger and indispensable skin, and then say, "Today, I don't want to talk about it, just talk about anything else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Occasionally, it’s good to let yourself relax.” Lauvita leaned against the door, his fingers twirling, and said softly, “So, did you think about the future?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like a dream, etc. I remember when I was a child, I really liked a red hairpin in the store in Fedu West Street. Looking back now, it’s just a very common item, I haven’t sold it yet. But I like it very much at that time. I want to buy it when I dream. I look at it through the window, as if I saw the most precious baby in the world. Now it’s worth it. The 100,000 diamond ring can't bring that feeling. I think this is the dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe, but now, how can I find it? Not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There must be, life is very interesting, you can travel, you can take risks, you can find another opponent to fight, there is always a kind of fun, you will be addicted to it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan replied in a whisper, "Probably." He picked up a piece of meat, bitten the lower half, tasted the taste, and thought with satisfaction, "The craft has not been lost." The plate was handed over, "It tastes good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I have to try my hand at the craft." The girl reached out and just took the plate and lost her arm. Then it fell, and the soft, unobstructed body was exposed to Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, I forgot to change my clothes." The girl shrugged, it was an accident, but a good accident, Lauvita thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s embarrassing." Fran picked up the towel and showed it naturally on the girl. "You change clothes and have breakfast. We went to the street."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this dating?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Counting holidays Well, maybe there will be no more leisure time in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the upstairs, Lauvita’s face began to turn red, a shame and attachment Feeling haunted her, "I am not worse than a big breast, well, even if it is bad, it is only inferior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran picked an eyebrow, just now he It is really embarrassing. In addition to the accident that happened to him, he and the girl have maintained a certain distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when sitting at the table, the two talked and laughed, as if nothing had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has a mask, whether it is against the enemy, relatives, friends, companions, lover, nature, let us cover up the true feelings, showing that we want to show others Look at the emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life, this is a masquerade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tandin is very lively, and the wedding ceremony in front of the royal family has brought the dignitaries to the public. According to the tradition, the holidays issued to the public have made the streets crowded and crowded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tourists dressed by two tourists are eagerly touring the capital of the city. They visited the sculpture group of Augustus Square and stayed at the Museum of Fine Arts. For an hour, I went to a comfortable restaurant for lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember that you don't like to eat the internal organs, I forgot when I ordered the meal." Fran cut the roast goose liver on the plate with a knife, in the girl After repeated requests, he became the appearance of a crow, wearing a fairly fitting light gray exterior with a neat fake beard and glasses on his lips. And with the makeup technique to modify the shadow of the cheekbones, he seems to be a full of academic, a little handsome boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If someone treats me, I will eat everything." Lauvita sneaked her eyebrows and swallowed a whole liver with a simmered juice. Gazing at the man's face with a playful smile. Although she is not supreme, the girl is more amiable about this appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they climbed to the Dongcheng Square to climb the Emperor's Column with 467 steps. The column is a tower-like building. People can follow the steps in the pillar and climb to the top platform with the fence. This is the tallest building in Tanding. It can see the panoramic view of the city. It is only open to celebrations and festivals. Two uniforms wearing gorgeous etiquette uniforms The ticketman stood beside the rotary gate at the entrance and exit of the ground floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't check the ticket faster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, there are too many visitors "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw a side door at the corner, can I get in there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Mr., that is the management room, not open to the outside world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulland nodded. Quietly lined up. No more words. And Lauvita got in his ear and said, "I always feel that you are playing a ghost idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bird's eye view of the city from a height, those styles, staggered Vertical and horizontal streets, as well as carriages and pedestrians. They all become box boxes and dark ants. The wind was so great that Lauvita took five minutes to finish the haircut in the stairwell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A street is a parliament building across the emperor's cylindrical tower. The defense is very strict. The buildings near the building are blocked by a red chain. Every ten steps, there is a fully armed guard. The members who come in and out are in A pass is hung on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, this is a private area of ​​the government." The guard blocked Fran, who was getting closer and closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I am a student of architecture. The House of Constantine was built during the period of Como II and is said to have used the most outstanding cross arch technique at the time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't have a pass, you can't get closer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, I see There are people who are not members of the Diet." Fran pointed to a small man who had just walked out of the building and wore a light yellow jacket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards are a little impatient. "That is the supply line staff responsible for the daily necessities of the House. Please leave immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All right." Fran squinted away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laugha is sitting next to the flower bed, she gently licks the silk on her forehead and greets the past, "I can I am sure you will use your brain again. Start at Augustus Square. You will be around a few streets near the parliament building. It seems that only I am enjoying leisure in one person today."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I admit that the terrain is being explored and consider how to enter the House quietly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use your sergeant palace The title of the Earl, it is easy to visit the House."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is too noticeable, and there is no reason to be alone in a room in the building." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A certain room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The President's office is on the fifth floor." Fran is simple The explanation shows, "Let's go to the market again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tanting's most prosperous commercial street is nearby, and the whole street is full of shops, neighboring Qianzhuang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is eager to enter and exit the shops, watch a wide variety of goods, and stay until dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this plan?" Lauvita couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anytime."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You always have something to do, let me guess Are you ready to rob the shop to create chaos?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran calls you, "This idea is pretty good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't seem to be, it is to think of the buyer's shop as a secret stronghold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's worth considering."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They slowly shuttled between the crowds, and Lauvita lingered all the way, insisting that Fran must continue to conceive some evil and perfect tricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran suddenly stopped in front of a narrow shop in a remote location, looking at the yellow window of the glass, on the tablecloth in the corner of the window, lying down Old-fashioned bright red hair clips with a strip of paint on the edges, revealing a white background. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luovita’s ankle pain, half leaning on the pillar of the street lamp, bending down, rubbing his legs, and sternly said, “very broken storefront, suitable for forgery It seems that the secret base I guessed is very correct..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s voice became lighter, and she saw the hairpin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I was young, I was looking forward to this." She exclaimed, thinking about something again, looking at Fran in disbelief. "Why, you have been looking for it." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can I, I don't know the style." Fran laughed. "But I am very happy that you can fulfill your childhood dreams."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bargain is very cheap, the owner is even glad to sell it, but Lauvita holds the hairpin, the expression on his face is blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't thank me, thank you for your luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
