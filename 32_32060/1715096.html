			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Zolfa Lonchi is not a gregarious, belongs to the specimen of the solitary widow, who has been getting older and more almost white in recent times. Only in the corners of the horns are some gray and black hair. His eyes always contain the suspicion of suspicion. It is a stubborn madman who does not hit the south wall. In the organization, his dragon pulse ability can only be counted. Cheng, but that kind of meticulous way of thinking and insight, he is increasingly respected by the shadow king Joe Corleone, for many things, he can infer the truth and hide behind the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one likes him, some people say privately, when Zall’s eyes look like a sinister snake, entangled your body coldly, his mouth There is always a disgusting sneer, as if to say nothing: don't want to hide, I already know your dirty little secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is now sitting in the chair of the room in a gloomy manner, unloading and loading the magazine of the pistol, and a conspiracy that is slowly brewing in the organization. Let him feel uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The King of Shadows is very afraid of his sister." He thought, "Mr. Corleone is not the blood of the King of Shadows. Life is a mystery. What is the Shadow King afraid of?" Is it related to her life, or..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, this is not my business." The micro-muscle of the corner of the dart's mouth* *Look, "I am now all-by-Byron, although the Shadow King organization is a good refuge, but it is also a prison for freedom. I can't waste time, the murderer of the punishment is still at large."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When thinking of the enemy, Zall Law burns in anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he always thinks that he is just, and he wants to use his own way to get the wrongful criminals to receive the treatment they deserve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little wild cat untied the bandage on the arm and annoyedly licked the left hand that he did not listen to. The wound healed to a good degree, but it was not able to make up the effort. The injury caused by the sword of Matida is serious, but it is too exaggerated. She smothered the hostile energy from the body. The arm never recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The damn sacred power is just right with your dragon, so be careful, I think these medicines are good for you." Joe Corleone Very nervous, spare no effort to find a solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is my brother’s medicine really effective?” she thought suspiciously, using a drawer to pull out the syringe, inserting the needle into the vial, filling it with a clear liquid and pushing it into the muscle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl leaned on the bed. Slowly understanding the effectiveness of the pharmacy, she felt that her head was getting heavier and he gradually slept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door snorted and woke the girl. She opened her eyes in a vigilant manner, but her body was like a stone, her limbs were stiff, for a time. Ann Corleone thought he had a petrified curse and magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother’s most trusted assistant, 裴吉雷克斯 stands in front of the door, he is also in the entire organization, second to his own master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Corleone. The leader needs you to go. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Day. Now, when I spend all the day to ease the injury, I have to add energy and strength at night." Ann raised eyebrows . "Go out, tell my brother, and urgent things will be said tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;裴吉雷克斯 stood still, Ann was a little angry, in the organization, still No one dares to violate her will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like me to go out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss, you don't have that now Ability." Yu Ji was unmoved and said calmly. "Yes, you should have no ability to get up. Fortunately, I am ready for the wheelchair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl seems to have read some meaningful foreign voice from his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zolfan Lonchi looked around the meeting room, where the audience was inside the organization, heavy curtains hindered the invasion of the sun, people’s faces Dyed into deep shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the instructions given to me by His Royal Highness, what do you think of it? To be honest, I am so angry that she dares to order me! Command the underground world. A powerful dog. Like a dog with a tail, you have to bow your knees for the bones!" Joe Corleone, like a raging lion, strode around in the conference room, with a killing on his face. "Mr. Long Qi, I have always admired your ingenuity. Please help me analyze and analyze how to avoid this shameful disaster. If there is no way, I would rather be with the gorse, the royal family, even the entire Byron Empire. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy was only slightly suspicious of the inside of the movie king, but Joe deliberately misinterpreted the contents of Missy’s instructions, so that everyone felt that the situation was urgent and that a great disaster was approaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zolf gently bites his nails, and he reads the copy of the instructions, using the harshest tone to let the shadow king explain what happened in the Gulf. The sensational crimes, the imperial princes disappeared, and there are clues about the dragons inside the shadow king. The organization must immediately surrender the traitors and investigate the whereabouts of the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many opinions in the conference room, and everyone is filled with indignation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Conspiracy...the relationship of interests...The King of Shadows is really a acting school," said Zall Law, a hidden dark wave inside the organization. I noticed that I have already got a clear understanding of Joe's thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you can’t turn your face with the store." Zolph replied categorically, "According to the lady’s wrist, I believe, just wait for her husband. Ascending the emperor's throne, she has at least 60% chance to control Byron's authority in secret. Although the organization is strong, it is only a horizontal comparison with the gang of the underground world. He grinds his teeth and sends out Gently sneer, no matter where it is an annoying role, "The gang is a gangster, and can only survive in the shadow of the national machine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several quite conceited cadres of the Shadow King felt that this sounded very uncomfortable. They were not in the opinion of the leader and could only glare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jo stared at Zall Law, and snorted angrily. "In fact, you said, I understand, but now it is not for you to say cool words, but to propose Solution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Check out the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the lady is on the fire If I don't respond in time, it is estimated that there will be an army of coffers immediately, which will cause great damage to the organization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for a sin-like lamb, Time to fight for the investigation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But there will be danger to life, perhaps the real enemy has not yet been found, and the sinner has been secretly executed."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The custody is a self-respecting person. She does not talk about false friendships, but she is not willing to owe her humiliation. If the members of the organization are killed, after the truth is out of the water, She will try to compensate and use one's life to exchange everyone's safety and after-the-fact benefits. It is a good deal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zall's ruthless words made everyone on the back cold, and the angry fire was poured into a basin of ice water, no one wants to play the role of a lamb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe Corleone sighed. "It’s just as sad as I thought. You don’t have to worry, for the safety of the entire organization. Someone has volunteered. Stand up. My sister, willing to sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sigh of relief, some people sneak a sigh of relief, some people have a cruel smile Some people are flushed, and they are not allowed to squat, but they are only a handful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An has made a lot of effort for the development of the organization. Her talent is also the best. Losing her is equivalent to breaking a wing. But after all, I am The leader. I have to consider the big picture. You entrust your life to me, I have to enjoy the glory with everyone. Well, this time we endure." The shadow of the king at this moment is like a benevolent saint. "Now, vote to decide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of eight cadres present, five people agree to raise their hands, including Zall Law, the rest of the table It’s hard to understand, "Day, it’s the young lady who has piled up your talents and taught you how to use and master. She is very kind to us. Is it for my own safety, for the sake of a little benefit, I will see the lady to die. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are even more glaring at Zall Law, "Miss is your savior, isn’t you a little grateful in your heart?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a well-arranged ruin. Shadow King has already made a decision. I want to clean the interior and completely eliminate Ann Corleone with her followers. . Any one sentence is wrong. It is a dead end. Zall Law thought that his look looked at the three impulsive cadres without any waves, and they silently mourned for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people are living tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am only living for myself, why should I manage others?" he replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a idiot, no mind, no ability, and can only be a thug." Joe thought, he stared at Zall, not From the weird old face, I found the wrong sign. "I just need him. I was worried that he would stand on the side of the cheaper sister. Otherwise, the energy of the two of them would not be so simple." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she lost her sister, she has a certain weakening in strength, but Joe can finally sleep well. He fears the strength of Ann, and the girl does not have the right to be on the **, but her exceptional ability is affected by a considerable part of the organization. The members are awe and admired, and they think that if she gets rid of the control one day and tries to retaliate, she feels that it is difficult to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;裴吉雷克斯 pushed the door in, whispered a few words in Joe’s ear, and the shadow king’s eyes rolled over a cruelty, gently selling against the objection of Ann Cowley. The people of Angyang raised their chins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loyal assistant nodded intently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe also ordered, "The military divisions organized in the future will be served by Mr. Long Qi, and the authority is second to me, and Yu Ji, Rex." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one thought that this nuisance, actually jumped into the third handle of the organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drow is expressionless and not happy. He bit his nails and began to think about it. "I finally have to pass through, I have to think again." I thought, how can I take Miss Corleone out of the trap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not kind, just...he thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arranging in Matida to find his way forward, an embarrassing rumor spread in the city near the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news of the old god’s bizarre recovery has spread throughout the village in one day. People are gathered outside the church and worshipping and praying. They all think it is a heavenly spirit. , cast a miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the news came to the city, many people did not believe that the miracle did not appear in the area of ​​the bishop, did not show up in the deacon, did not show spirit In the annual contribution to the church, a small old god, how can He De? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a week late at night, the village church hosted by the gods secretly welcomed a distinguished guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carthof Tovita, the saint warrior elder of the holy city of Anno, the red man of the Pope’s predecessor, sitting gracefully on the dilapidated bench in the church Slowly cut off the cigarette butt of the cigar and slowly turned it on the orange fireworks of the match. He took a deep breath and slowly spit out the smog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, this is a disrespect to the kingdom of heaven." The old god shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Disrespect?" The elders of the samurai smiled mockingly, and the voice was severe. "What is really disrespectful is you! The mouth of the Pope, any seeing Marty The clerics of Da, should immediately report to the high-level of the region. I checked, two months ago, you brought a girl back to the church. All her features are consistent with the head of Hepburn, but you are I haven’t seen it. If it’s not a rumored miracle, it makes me suspicious, and it really makes you smash the past.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gibron sighed, “That’s a Good boy. Let her go, one will only play with the hearts of the people, but gradually forget the good religion, and there will be a moment of destruction. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sinner of the sinner is actually sophistry, not squatting." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man looked at the position with his innumerable ranks, mastered the big man who was killed and killed, but he had pity in his eyes. "Although I am just an incompetent lower-level god, but Also know. Only heaven can make mortal worship. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The will of the kingdom of heaven." But in the hands of mortals, and I am one of them. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Ai was getting hotter and hotter in her sleep. The smoke from the door was so hot that she coughed.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl jumped up from the bed and ran out in exclamation. The window was full of bright fire and rolling smoke. She slammed the doors of the brothers’ bedroom and took the two The crying little devil head rushed out of the house.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw the church connected to the house, burning, greedy boiling snake, positive I swallowed it a little bit, and the old wooden church quickly collapsed into a ruin.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembered it. Didn’t see Grandpa, desperately The land shouted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villagers who came to pick up the buckets and basins tried to control the spread of the flames.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;At dawn, the fire is finally completely extinguished.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People look carefully in the ruins, but they don’t find the old god’s body, the fire is too strong, can Will be human and wood Together into unrecognizable ashes <br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;But they still found strange places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was such a rapid fire that only burned the church. But it was not implicated in the wooden house where the children were sleeping, and the flammable wooden roof house still stood beside the ruins of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all said that this is the soul of the old gods in the blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church is on fire, and the rumors that the presiding gods burned together have spread. Many people combine the rumors of miracles not long ago, and they all think that it is a sacred, supreme The king of heaven punishes the liar of lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The old guy is really damn, actually dare to offend the sacred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Matilda After learning, she tirelessly rushed back, she only saw a piece of coke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl covered her face in pain, she knew it was not an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carthof Toveta, the official officer of the Annofa Hall, a bloodthirsty executioner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida didn’t see anyone, she was afraid to be implicated in them again, silently concealing her figure and standing in front of the ruins of the fire for a whole night. She was trembling, and the hottest magma was boiling in her eyelids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One night, Matida seems to be mature ten years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Tian Wei Meng, she finally moved, pulled out the sword, cut off the hair scattered on the shoulders, gently put the white gold hair, gently Throwing to the ruins, like throwing a bunch of white flowers of mourning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The head of the sinful sin, Elder Motovita." The girl muttered, but the voice was light, but it contained a great force. "You know." You murdered a true saint. I swear by sword and glory. From this moment, it is no longer the cleric of Anno, but I will not give up respect for the kingdom of heaven, even if no one admits, no one agrees. I can't take my faith, because this is the way that the kingdom of heaven guides me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She no longer ignorant, no longer confused, fire in her heart The sword in her hand, accompanied by her continued advancement, forgiveness, or trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
