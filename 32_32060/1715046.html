The gun, then a bite, rolled down the cliff. After a while, he hung in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disaster did not easily close, the knot slipped from the corner of the rock, and the dagger was being locked on the waist, the body suddenly slammed, hit and fall. Go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucky also cares for him at the same time, the leaves of the years, let the surface of the basin, full of soft mulch. This saved Zall's life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was dizzy and stood up, resisting the violent pains of the whole body, listening to the sound of the roaring bullets, even crawling and rolling towards the depths of the woodland Escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get the rope ladder ready." Lauvita said calmly, "The injury made him escape, the two teams, chasing the past, first discovering the target." The team, fired the gun to report the position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zall law can't run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that he is going to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ribs have at least one broken piece. Every time you move it, you will feel the burning pain of the knife. The right arm is rushed and fractured, completely abolished. Struggling to crawl on the ground, the blood is scattered on the black soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he slowly climbed to a tree, half leaning on the trunk, coughing, and the scene in front of him was getting blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is filled with the smell of decay, quiet, like an open-air cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death..." Drowl raised his left hand and unfolded his palm, as if he wanted to catch something in the virtual space, he was desperately hoarse and angry. Shouting, "No... I have to live... those murderers..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there has been a rustling sound of people stepping on the rot leaves, chasing the soldiers? Zolfa clenched the gun, smirked, and there was a bullet left. Before he died, he was ready to kill a funeral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps stopped, on the right. His chest undulating, violently buckled the trigger, the force is great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Zolfa feel that the fingers will not break. He concentrated all the anger, all the indignation, and all the convictions on this last shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The murderer!" The blood squats down the forehead, making Zolfa's eyes bloody, and he screams wildly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet is in the air, with a rolling green mans. Fly over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Mans? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusion before death? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咦?" On the right side, there was a crisp female voice, the bullet, which was not far from her, hitting a big tree . The whole tree was actually shaken, and the half-wild leaves were raining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman walked slowly and stared down at Zall Law. "Awakening before the death. Interesting. This ability to infuse on foreign objects." The talent, I saw it for the first time." "Dragon pulse?" Zall method has not heard this term, but that is not important. He barely opened his eyes again. He seems to have seen the death in front of the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a beautiful death, what a beautiful eye, the green scorpion that can't see the pupil, like the most precious agate, glows in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You... want to take me away?" Dall asked laboriously. Then a cold finger gently wiped the blood on his face, soothing and gentle. In the meantime, he seems to have returned to his childhood and returned to the home where his mother was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom..." Zallfa whispered and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ann Coleone reaches out. Touching Zall's chest, "There is a weak heartbeat. If you treat it in time, you may be able to survive. Any dragon is our precious strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly frowned, looking through the jungle wood, looking far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nine people are coming here...one of them is also a dragon. What day is today, actually come out for a walk. You can meet two." Ann Corleone recited, "However, the secret base of the organization is in the depths of the basin. Since it is here, you will bring what you see into the coffin." Her voice is so cold that it is like a sacred earth. Cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work 16k novel network exclusive text version of the first release, without permission can not be reproduced, excerpts, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just returned to the palace, Peggy looked at the cousin Isa has been waiting for a long time, curiously watching the Royal Knight behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks a little similar to Peggy, but the contours of her face are more supple, Missy is not wrong, it is really a very beautiful monkey. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister, you are back." The girl cheered and rushed over, holding her spoiled, and then asked uneasily, "Sister, I can be here." Do you live for a few days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you tempered again? Such a big person, at least know the rules." Peggy opened the cousin indifferently. Hand, "I don't want to be disturbed, you can go to find a hotel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't know, sister, dad, he actually wants me to marry! If he mentions it again, I really commit suicide to him!" Isa exaggeratedly put her arm in front of Peggy's eyes, and there were several shallow red prints on her wrist that were not broken. "I heard from others. What kind of Kasimodo Bo Knight is a disgusting rich landlord." She screamed endlessly, "Hey, Dad doesn't know what to think, but I can marry the lady of the Golden Sparrow House. How can I marry? A country aristocrat!" She thought about it and stressed, "It's still a ugly bun. If I see him, I must laugh at it." I dare to hit my mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Others? It’s your stupid friends."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, sister, you are the smartest." In Isa's nephew, there is a kind of adoration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I knew this before, and I mentioned you to him just now." Peggy said with a smile, "Unfortunately, the other party refused." Isa's eyes widened in surprise, making her more like a stupid doll. "The guy actually... dare to reject me, not because I am going to get rid of him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa's father, in the family is not ambition, although the name of Reinschmann is empty, but has no ability, relying on the routine routine of Lulu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is estimated to assign his daughter to a wealthy and promising new aristocrat, so that he can re-establish his home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
