The cold current at dawn allowed him to wake up from a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was awake, his thoughts were still in his dreams, his body curled into a ball, his hands and feet were cold and stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom...that's not my fault...they are the murderers..." He shouted, his voice crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zolf Lungi was born in a secluded and remote town in the west. When he was just delivered, he was as thin as a shit with no blinks. The doctor even said, "Maybe you can't live, even if you can live, you will be sick afterwards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Dead kid, I am already unlucky enough, you still bother me!" Lao Longqi licked a leg, biting the cork on the bottle with his teeth, and pouring the inferior ale into the throat. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when he grew up healthily, it has surprised many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to hate his father from the time he was sensible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In countless nights, he lay in bed, listening to the quarrels and loud noises downstairs, tossing and turning, not falling asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, he always saw his mother red and swollen half face, busy in the kitchen, and Dad, I don’t know which pub is so drunk. mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Baby, have breakfast, today have your favorite corn." Mom smiled and touched his head, turned magical, let empty The table is filled with potato cakes, sausages, tofu balls and boiled corn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his mother is just an ordinary country woman, in the eyes of Zall Law, mother is the most beautiful beauty in the world. He is attached to the care of his mother and puts all his love into her. Every day when his father is not at home, he sits at a low table and spells the words he just learned. His mother is on the sidelines and speaks homely. This is the most happy time for Zall Law in the gloomy childhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, he said to his mother, "Mom, leave the man. We both can live very well."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What the man, he is your father." The mother blamed, holding him in his arms and comforting. "Your dad was the most powerful player in the town that year, and the workers who unloaded at each station took him, but one. The accident..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is life." Finally, the mother said long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is life? Little Zall thought. No, it should not be the life of my mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, he even designed a lot of ways to kill his father, repeatedly scrutinizing every step, but at the age of eleven, in his mind The plan will never be realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like every alcoholic home, the father was drunk on the street that night, when it was discovered after the day. It is already under heavy snow. A cold body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the funeral, Zolfa just wanted to laugh, and he tried desperately. So that the eyes are sore and the tears flow out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the age of eleven to twenty, he turned from a half-big boy to a steady big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been many girls who actively pursued him. Zall Law does not like anyone. He only loves his mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he became a regular police officer in the town’s police station and received a salary, Zall’s thought, “There is always a day, I can be in the city. In, buy a big house. Live with my mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small patrol's meager salary makes him far away from the big house. Zall Law began to learn the methods of the predecessors, to collect protection fees from the shops, and the gangs called brothers and brothers, and the old police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has a hobby, and even if he is in a lively occasion, he never drinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day at dusk, he was on the corner of the street, blocking a long chestnut hair. A man with a short gray hair and a strange look found a bloody dagger from the man's pocket during the search. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Turn around, hold your hand behind your head, kneel down!" Zall was stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suspect blinked and saw no pedestrians around him. He said with a smile, "A little case, don't be too nervous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you immediately explain, you can get a commutation. Opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The salary of the police officer is not high, it is not as good as..." The suspect whispered, "Fifty, you will let me go." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is equal to the average patrolman’s wages for half a month, and he is heartbroken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What have you done?" Drow's approached and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stolen a wallet, but was discovered by the owner, so I gave a knife, rest assured, not tied."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This case is not too small." Zall method hesitated for a while, "according to the rules, at least two hundred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Two hundred, it is a few people, now you know, simply, one hundred and five."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One hundred and eight."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let go of the suspect, returned to the police station with satisfaction, and took off his uniform and locked it in the cupboard. Put on and go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody at home, my mother has not returned yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably went to the church to attend the mass, then I am going to prepare dinner today." He went into the kitchen and put on the apron that his mother used to cook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a pot of miscellaneous soup was cooked, the night was already dark, and Zall Law heard an urgent knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A colleague in the bureau stood at the door and said with a heavy face, "The Longchi brothers, two hours ago, in the square near the church, there was a robbery. Killing the case, you'd better be mentally prepared. Your mother, because of too much blood loss, has just been declared invalid by the doctor, already..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Zall said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of his colleague's horrified expression, he closed the door hard, went back to the kitchen, added a soup with a spoon, and tasted it. "It tastes good, and my mother likes to eat light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laid out the table and cooked the soup. "Mom comes back and can eat it directly." He smiled and said, then went back to the room to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, when Zall Law went downstairs, he saw the soup on the table, and the soup that had not been moved, "No..." This shouted hoarsely and burst into tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murderer ran away without a trace, until now, did not catch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Zall method collapsed because at the police station, he saw eyewitnesses’ confession: medium-sized, gray-haired, brown-brown hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Fifty, you just let me go...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" One hundred and eight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gloomy began to become synonymous with Zall Law Lonchi, he worked enthusiastically, acting unscrupulously, not letting go of any chance to climb up, This allowed him to be promoted to the detachment of the Western Dark Police Hall when he was 35 years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a small town family, without the background, the background police, the speed of promotion is already very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as the team leader took over the case, there is no worthwhile, he likes to bite the criminals until they are sent to the trial." Dark Police officials praised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain stopped, and the violent mountain wind blew away the residual smog. Zall's law check out the bag, in addition to the necessary compass, there is a box of climbing nails, two rolls of lasso, half a match, a few cans of meat, a small pistol and a six-particle bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out the map and began to look at the current location, but some of the terminology used in the mountaineering industry, Zall Law is not very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope not to get lost." Zolfa said to himself, looked up at the dawn of dawn, made a mark on the road map, and then lifted the package. Follow a sloping slope and head towards the other side of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The murderer..." He whispered, and the blue veins on his forehead appeared. "You are all murderers. I will live and send sinners to hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After three hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the cave in front, the situation was discovered." A gang gunman reported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita crouched down and tried to test the temperature of the bonfire. "There is a little warm inside, and our distance from the target is very close." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said with excitement, "You can't run now, the limestone mountain range is your burial bone."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 2:30 in the afternoon, Lauvita finally caught up with Zolfa Longch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Catch up!" There was a burst of cheers and whistles in the auditorium of Tantin's racecourse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not a cut, it seems that this former champion horse, in the hands of Lord Knight, is about to be the Earl, and has regained his vitality." The ceremonial ceremonies shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young jockey Mike, holding a horse, full of excited blush, proudly round the field for a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The god of the moon, has been taken away by your wind." Viscount Kate laid down and slap, whispering to Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mike's riding is not bad, it is worthy of being a Jockey family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If The wind is not a horse, I really want it to marry my moon god, their descendants must be the best of all Byron." Viscount haha ​​laughed, "the marriage with the family of the Knights, but now people are in the mouth The topic that appeared the most."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran felt the goodwill to adjust you, he smiled and just prepared to say something, the waiter in the dress walked into the private room, A tray was handed to Tandon's current most attention-grabbing diamond bachelor, with a red ribbon wrapped around the plate and a hot lion-headed eagle sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a royal family member who has privately arrived at the racecourse?" The Viscount is no stranger to the Royal Special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
