			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Zolfa Lonchi walked through the corridor and silently remembered the environment along the way. He walked down the steps and fainted the lights on the walls on both sides. He came to an iron gate and slammed his chin to order the guard to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, please be careful." The guards cautioned against Zall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is she not being held in control?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Erfa read a kind of awe from the guard's face, even if the girl is now a weak woman with no strength, but in the minds of many members of the organization, the gods or demonic imprints left behind are indelible. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is a thick piece of steel embedded in the stone, the manpower is difficult to move, under the action of the mechanism shaft rim, slowly open a gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked in without incident, the room was dark and dirty, the air was turbid, and some moldy straw was piled up in the right corner, and the walls were piled up by large rocks. Made up, no gaps, manpower is difficult to move, only a small window that is breathable, is a circular hole that is directly piled on the stone, the hole is a slope with a low height inside and outside, narrow and compact, even the gnome can not climb out . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the girl squatting on the haystack, wrapped in a crumpled blanket, and the drug kept her in a state of stiff limbs. Let anyone kill. The beautiful face is covered with tears, but the hot and angry fire in the eyes seems to immediately evaporate the tears into water mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drow law is clear, there are hidden eavesdropping pipes in the wall, and people are paying attention at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel handcuffs and anklets bind the girl firmly, and the other end of the chain is connected to the wall. Unless the girl can recover, she can't get rid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is as strong as her dragon pulse, it will eventually be flesh and blood, will bleed, will be painful, will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strong emotion swept over him, and Zall Law wanted to protect this woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t be impatient. There are at least three lords of the lord of the princes who are loyal to the loyalists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Corleone. I just want to say sorry." Zallfa whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anmei bit her lip and looked at her voice. The drug caused her to have sensory obstacles, irritating the eyeball, and unable to suppress tears. She had been aiming at the focal length of Huanren for a long time. When she saw the people coming, the girl spit in anger and snorted in her throat. "Brother? Why didn't he come to see me? You are a despicable accomplice, and I saved your life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Indeed, you saved me. Life, but always you are a loser, there is no force but no foresight and vigilance against people. I didn't think about accompanying you to death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The King of Shadows is a sultry leader, but it is this kind of person who will gain power, so I admire him." Zolfa squatted down and slowly reached out. Wipe the tear marks on the girl's cheeks. "I can't save you, and I don't plan to save you, but at least. Before you die, you can make you live better. Next time I bring some food and a clean blanket."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei twisted her neck and tried to avoid the old man's hand, but soon, she stopped struggling, and there was a strange light in her eyes. She felt that the hand was not a man trying to think. It is cheap, but it is conveying some kind of signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking...method...save you...cooperate...have surveillance..." The finger padd the text on the skin of her cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what's wrong, you have always been guilty of me, now I see it is difficult. Just want to satisfy your place?" said the girl, "Good. Well, I will cooperate with you, just take a bite by the dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pharmaceutical...Unwinding...Poisoning...Restoration..." Fingers continue Rowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I can't move my hands and feet now, and I don't have any fun. It's better to go to the antidote. The doctor in the organization is always responsible for this, he should have. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss. Are you a fool when I am? For you to unlock the drug, the first one will die. "Zolf nodded with a slight approval, but deliberately shouted in his mouth. "But I have a new idea, maybe Michael has some more interesting medicines." He chuckled. "Okay, I am ready to come again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened was quickly conveyed to the shadow king, and Joe Coleon laughed. "I can’t really see it. Our Longchi army is very boring. But he’s been too calm. Unlike a normal person, this makes me feel more relieved. If there is a **, there is a weakness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;裴吉雷克斯 sighed, "The leader, this Things are too mean. After all, Miss is your nominal sister. Even if she is killed, she must meet her status."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe touches his chin," With a dying abandonment of the son, and the loyalty of the subordinates, this sale is also cost-effective." He calculated, said to Yuji, "You don't care about this matter, first clean up all the followers of the organization within the organization. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second person of the Shadow King organization shook his head sadly. He is not a good person, but he has a certain morality." Longqi, everyone is a nuisance when you are, but I appreciate your pie. I didn't expect it, I missed you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; showing a very sympathetic member of Ann Corleone, a total of eleven people, including three cadres, have received orders to come to a hidden woodland ten miles from the manor, at first they thought it was a mission Arrange, whisper to each other and wait for the leader to appear, must unite to overthrow his resolution, if the situation does not improve, even if the use of force should protect the safety of the lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am just a countryman. If it is not a young lady, this life is rotten in the fields and fertilizers. She has piled up my talent and gave me Hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was framed in prison for a little twenty years because of a little thing! The dark prisoner made me desperate, until now, I still I remember that when I was preparing to commit suicide, the lady forcibly broke into the detention center and smiled and said to me, "The interesting potential, come with me, I will give you a new world." "In order to please the big man's favor, I decided to sacrifice the lady. I will not agree to death." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were very angry, clenched their fists, screaming, and a knightly spirit of contagion spread in the crowd.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But half an hour has passed, the leader has not come yet.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mind is flexible and the person who perceives it is not good, why this time The so-called actions were all organized by members of the organization of Miss Aidean Corleone. When everyone returned to God, there was a long, horrified silence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;On the outside of the woodland, they saw the leader Joe Corleone coming out of the shadows. He was in the position of half a step behind him. More, he was a member of the organization who was completely loyal to the film king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fuel that masks the smell of the nose by chemical substances has already wet the ground and trunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raging fire burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disgusting smell of coke is lingering in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are trapped in the burning jungle. A handful of superb men rolled out of the fire and were cut off by the dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murderer is properly arranged and has no life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the meeting, you can be safe without any trouble." Shadow King thought that his cheap sister, although in the early development of the organization, sent quite Important use, but now no use value, just an uneasy factor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as the massacre. Zall Law, Long Qi acted, this is the last chance, Shadow King and Rex are not in the manor, he must grasp well, one step can not make a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Michael’s room is not spacious, very messy, like a cheap country hotel room, but the things displayed in the closet are a bit horrible, a glass only Preservatives in the cans are used to soak various internal organs and animals. There are also people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was before joining the Kings. It is an ordinary doctor who is obsessed with medicine. His family is full of books and notes. In the eyes of colleagues, Michael is quite awkward. It is also a good doctor who is respectful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later he and a woman, although not very beautiful, but the gentle personality of the nurse talked about love, and soon married, familiar with him, strange people actually have a girl Will fall in love with a temperamental person, but also sincerely bless them both. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, the doctor’s newly married wife disappeared, but he seemed indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving a detailed investigation, the police who received the report from the relatives of the nurses grasped important clues and rushed into the doctor's house in the storage room. The patrolmen saw a horrific scene: the doctor was wearing a white big make-up, and he was busy at the iron table. His wife, tied to the cold table, was a body that had been cut open in the abdominal cavity. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angry police put out the gun and ordered him to raise his hand against the wall, but Michael answered impatiently. "Don’t bother me, Mary just pregnant. Rare. Opportunity, I am trying to figure out the structure and organizational components of the embryo at the initial stage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struggled to pursue the girl and deceive her to marry herself, just for this one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media named the madman "Devil's Doctor", the trial was a sensation, no lawyer was willing to defend him, the court sentenced him to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he waited for the sentence to arrive, there was a riot in the prison, and several premeditated heavy criminals were supposed to be outside and successfully escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael took the opportunity to escape, the lucky god looked after him like a blink of an eye, when the jailbreak prisoners were re-captured soon, only Michael disappeared. trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He became a doctor in the underground world who specializes in serving gangsters. He has excellent medical skills, so although he has not become the potential of Dragon Wave, Shadow King still hired him for himself. Formulate some brainwashing agents and poisons that have magical effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is swearing in a small proverb, busy in front of a test tube-filled table. Recently, doctors are studying the body of the Dragon Mairs, trying to find out why they can be different from ordinary people. Become a superman who has the ability to control non-secular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot of the best experimental materials were sent to me immediately, and the shadow king promised me to give me the remains of the traitors in the organization. I can't wait to study," I thought I couldn't wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door made Michael look back from the fanatical imagination, he looked back at Zolfa Longch, The military sergeant who just became a cadre of the organization was sullen and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His sergeant, can I help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to get some poison It's good to apply it to bullets. It may have an unexpected effect. What do you have to introduce?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it’s right for you to find me." Michael rubbed his hand. "I just developed a toxin. As long as one milligram enters the body, it can make the blood solidify into a hard block."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, is there a drug that can make people muscle paralyzed and keep tearing?" Zall Law said the girl's symptoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean, cry,?" Michael shouted the poisonous name. "The main ingredients are black laurel oil and colchicine. It’s violent and the attack is very slow.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I want this.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor Shrug your shoulders, open the sliding door of the cabinet, and pull out a small glass bottle from inside, filled with light yellow thick liquid. "It's not very refined, you can't give more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to..." Zall Law seems to think of something. "Is there an antidote? In case my finger is scratched, it is infiltrated into the body by this poison..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, of course." The doctor secretly resented the other person's annoyance. I looked in the cupboard for a while. "Hey, there is still a little bit left. The effect of crying is too slow. Very few assassins will use it, so I didn't prepare much antidote to neutralize the toxin. Not long ago, the leader still looked for it. I want some..." He stopped his hand. Suspiciously staring at Zall Law, "What do you want to do? If you remember correctly, Miss Corleone is the poison in the middle, the leader will not allow..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The mouth of the gun spouted a secluded green mang, and it rang silently. The first shot blew a big hole in the doctor’s throat. The second shot ran through his head. When he had not fallen to the ground, the devil doctor already It is a dead body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 pm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Zolfa took a square wooden food box, he came back to the prison where Anmei was imprisoned. The guard has already received an order from the Shadow King. All the requirements for the new military division must be obeyed without blocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards checked the items carried by Zall Law in accordance with the rules and found no tools to assist the prisoners to escape. There was only a clean blanket, and the jam black bread and a pot of hot cocoa were placed in the food box. There was no doubt, so the prison gate was opened in compliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know there is a monitor, but I will stay away from it, I don't want the little ** to be eavesdropped." Before the law handed over the pistol, a warning shot was fired. The light on the stone wall was in front of the prison. The guard room in front of the prison was dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several monarch-class dragon jailers knew what Zall Law was going to do from the last conversation they had stolen. Although they disliked his arrogance, the leader greeted him and nodded to each other, feeling that he did not have to turn a face for this dirty break and the re-used red man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl leaned against the wall and saw him coming in, not to be inspired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zall method made a snoring gesture and whispered to An Mei, "The antidote is in the food."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He half lifted up Amway’s head and slowly poured the hot cocoa into the girl’s mouth. Then open the bread, the inside is hollow, concealing the combination of unlocking tools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly snoring, the lock of the cockroach was opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for chronic poisons, whether it is effective or neutralizing toxins in the body, it is a slow process, time is tight, and the organization is completely in control. The Shadow King will come back at any time and give instructions for the execution of the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a full 20 minutes, An Mei can barely move muscles, and the lost Dragon Power can not be fully rested, and can’t be used. She can recover completely, and then she is cheating on the door of the prison, and with the power of the girl's full prime, she can safely leave the village with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't delay the time, or the guards will be suspicious." Zall said, "You can only use the second method."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up, took off the large hooded cloak, folded the blanket into a pillow size, tied it in the cloak, and put it on Anmei, although he was taller than the girl. However, in the recent days, the girl always stood up, so the girl stood up straight, wrapped her hat around her head, and then, after proper camouflage, swept away with her eyes, and her height posture was the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Install it as I go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you do?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can quickly recover your ability and come in time, you can save my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girl I carefully looked at the old man for a while and whispered, "I owe you a favor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of escape was very smooth. The guards never expected the two to exchange their identity. The lights were deliberately extinguished by Zall Law. In the dark, they only saw the humpback army officer, wearing a cape cap, and slowly moved up the steps and disappeared. The corner of the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards looked at the room in the eye, and the shadows in the corner were indeed lying, so they locked the iron door with confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zall law should be proud, he actually used the simplest props and a little trick to complete the impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must be crazy." The old man lay in the stinky haystack, panic and emotion began to lick his nerves, each slightly sensible The people will not put themselves in this dead place, pin their lives on a hand-stained blood, and the female assassin walking in the dark can come back in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you have to gamble, trapped in this criminal organization, I will always be a pawn who has no freedom, and I am with the criminal who pursues it." In the meantime, the power gap is too big. If I can get an ally in the underground world, the single strongest force, everything will be different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I can survive..." He muttered in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zolf Lonchi fainted countless times, he was beaten constantly, he saw Joe Corleone solidified with a scared face, positive Crazy yelling at his ear. "Where is she going? You should be a madman who is torn into pieces!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, kill me, you She lost the cost of bargaining with her.” Zall's law barely opened his swollen eyes, revealing a sign-like sneer, and he vomited blood. “I am alive, good for you.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maniac, who do you think you are? Just a wanted criminal who has nowhere to go." Spit on his face, the corner of his eye saw a man lifting the iron The stick, then the pain in the knees of his right leg, he fainted again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was awake again, he felt himself lying on the soft wet land, the smell of the sun in the air, he struggled to support the painful body, but found The right leg is unaware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your leg is finished, the entire knee bone is broken." Someone said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
