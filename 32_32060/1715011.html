			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Cecilia shrank the whole body in the bed, only showing a small tail, she was shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just changed the room, and the new roommate, but last night, that very delicious and very dangerous food. "I knew that she was also the sister of the troupe. I wouldn't eat it." The orc girl muttered. She was used to the stable life of the troupe. At this moment, she was like a stolen cake locked in the cupboard, but she was elder. Found children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, there was no movement outside, Cecilia sneaked her head out of the quilt, and immediately screamed, Matilda sat warmly on the bed On the head of the chair, staring at her. The lights in the room were very dark, and the dim light made the whole house look blurry. Cecilia could not see the other person's expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, want to kill me?" she said softly. "Last night, it was you who attacked me."<br /><br />&nbsp "&", Cecilia nodded and immediately shook her head. "I am just hungry, and I don't know if you are your own." She excused aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The physique that grows by plundering energy is really special." Matilda reached out and tried to touch the head of the little orc, and Cecilia saw it. She raised her hand and immediately flashed abruptly to the end of the bed, her eyes became a slit, and she put on a pair of claws. "I apologize! Want to fight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, actually, I want to thank you, reminding me of a lot of things." Matilda's five fingers slowly opened, and a white swaying sway in the palm of his hand, "Want to eat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really don't get angry?" Cecilia cautiously came over and swallowed her mouth and looked at the delicious food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promise not to be angry with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medida smiles and looks at the orcs The girl happily absorbed the white flame, and the tail kept swaying, such as a puppy who was only looking for the owner's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that I have been imprisoned in my mind, but the blessing of this dragon girl, she tried to suck me, but also to eat Lost." She has many unknown doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who gave himself the imprisonment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the father I saw just, so strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most disgusting thing for her is a dreamlike picture, which seems to be so dark that it can touch the dark clouds. The horrible lightning flashed between the clouds, the nearby mountain hills shivered, the screams and screams wrapped in the black darkness, and the fire and bright blood of the sky, what does that mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida wrinkled the thinly curved eyebrows and rubbed his head. "It’s still flustered, like a group."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie can open the door with a pastry candy. "Girls, do you want to come?" She proudly praised the dessert in her hand. "My stomach is not hungry." Cecilia said that the energy of the white flame was comparable to a whole night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to eat, I like sweetest." Matilda jumped up and slaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you finish eating, remember to brush your teeth, or you will grow bugs in your mouth." Nicole warned with a serious look, although the girl was only three years old, but The sigh of intelligence makes Nicole love Matilda like an elder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida 乖乖 promised to gargle. When Nicole went out, her happy expression immediately returned to indifference. Turn around and ask Cecilia. "You don't eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc girl shook her head. "No fire for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If you want to eat again, listen to me." Matilda pushed open the window. Throw the dessert out, in the air, covered with colored paper sugar, and painted a beautiful graphic black forest cake with cream, with a pale fire, before the landing, it turned into lime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before finding memories, continue to let others think that I am still mentally retarded and will better protect myself." She thought, "The Heaven Congress blesses me, Don't worry. Let me know what I want to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the next day is about to dawn, Fran stands in front of Matida’s bed and looks at the girl’s sleep. The face, the long eyelashes are slightly shaking, the cheeks are fascinating with the apple color, the window is only half closed, and the wind is coming in, so that the white golden scent of the waterfall on the pillow will occasionally have small ripples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cecilia did not sleep on her own bed, and was huddled with Matida. I also slept soundly, and pouted from time to time, as if I had dreamt of a fragrant food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Matida, his eyes flickering. Finally, he sighed heavily. "Hope, don't bother my revenge." "For the first time in the sewers of Feidu, the second time in the woods of Dawn Fort, I have saved you twice, and you almost Kill me two times." Fran thought, "forgiveness and compassion, will not endlessly pay, but nothing more than three, otherwise I will abandon indecisiveness and the final conscience, become fierce and cruel."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and lifted some messy quilts, tightened the curtains and the window roots, went out, and gently closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Fran left, Mattida opened her eyes and sat up leaning against it, staring at the closed door, thoughtfully. She crept down the bed, put her ear on the door, listened for a long time, then went to the window and pushed the glass window back again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way she can escape immediately in a dangerous moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida is deeply insecure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The haze of mist shrouded the streets, the morning bus at Tantin Station, like a ghost in the fog, slowly moving through the city, through Augustus After the Plaza and the Bull Plaza, the beach gate left Constantin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many people in the car, and there are fewer passengers after leaving the city. The people who do the morning bus are usually rushing to the staff who are working near the town. At the third stop, Fran follows the passengers at the station and walks off the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deliberately went back a long way, wrapped around the clumps, spurred the magic of the ring, changed back to the handsome man’s appearance, and then put the fit clothes Change it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the land in the city is expensive, many second- and third-rate small companies have offices or headquarters outside the city, so this town is early in the morning. Come and go, the accountant holding the briefcase, holding the flyer, carrying the product salesman, rushing to eat some breakfast in the restaurant, and rushing to the company or the place agreed with the customer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran went into an ordinary café, and at first glance he saw sitting in the corner while hamming his mouth and looking at the waitress A small bounce of the round butt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very good, no cool appointments. He thought, sitting opposite Xiaobis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, I arrived in the night, and there was no delay." Little Bies quickly swallowed the ham and poured a few big mouthfuls of coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it found?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, a veteran of the Gulf who specializes in forgery certificates The final mark was recognized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper found in the box of Igo Andech has always made Fran very doubtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still loyal to them. Lurk like lurking...if there is a key The information that is forced, waiting at the designated place at the appointed time, is the guide of Raymond. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has analyzed it several times, such as " Still loyal to them, lurking like a wolf." The "they" in it seems to refer to Andrei's master, the gorse, and perhaps Andrei is a double-sided shackle, relying on both sides. Take the benefits of both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that the gorse has a latent enemy. However, Fran did not have any clues. In the article, Mr. Raymond, a member of the Senate, did not have this name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that can be traced is the seal at the end of the document. It was a black round bottom layer with a blue trim. The middle of the outline depicts a bright red bloody spear knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran was asked to investigate this matter before leaving Golden Bay. They made an appointment, with or without results. I met each other today. Obviously. The giant boxing smashed out the clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The crest is very rare..." said Little Beas. "But the fake veteran sees the details from a few details. It is not a mark of any family. Because there is no formal nobility. Adding people and horses to the family emblem does not conform to the rules of heraldry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Continue."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And the mysterious associations or underground organizations that generally act, they are more free to do when designing the badge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"This is equal to not saying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, don't worry. Forged veterans have seen similar signs, gold bottom inserted yellow cloth, white sword infantry The pattern, and the red knight seems to be a set."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the organization of the sword infantry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The fake veteran was not willing to say at first, afraid of getting into trouble. But finally the fist and the ticket finally let him open his mouth." Xiao Bisi showed off his wrist, but after seeing Flemish's indifferent expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a rush to stop talking. "It’s the secret police of the Department of Political Affairs of the Constantine Security Department."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Safety Hall?" Fran touched his chin and conspired with Igo Andrsey to be a blood knight, most likely also an official institution. On the upper level of Tantin, there is a group of great people who are hostile to the gorse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Bies continues to report, "But Joe Coleon’s whereabouts are uncertain, and the King’s organization seems to have evaporated from the human world, and there is no trace. This is also the most worrying thing for Kregan boss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Investigating Corleone must be extra careful." Fran said. “How is the current gang?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There is a thriving, Kregan boss is preparing to expand the arms and smuggling market, and Miss Whiteman is responsible for the investment in the securities, we Black and white come together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lautetta..." Fran touched her forehead with a painful look. The girl did not follow her advice, or with the gang. Mixed in one. "Give me a good voice for Whiteman and Kreigan." He said helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about half an hour, Fran is ready to leave. "The second Thursday of each month, I will meet in this place. I need gang intelligence and some new tasks for you to complete."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good But head, where is your stronghold in Tantin? Maybe it is more convenient to contact when there is an emergency message."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to know", Fran May tell the Cardinals Troupe and the transformation of things, "If things are urgent, um, I will rent a private inbox at the Tanting Post Office. At the bottom of the mailbox, I will draw a purple crow. If there is news, it will be served. Go there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work 16k novel network exclusive text version of the first release, without permission can not be reproduced, excerpts, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four-storey Tantin Judicial Office is located on the right side of Plaza Augustus, with the highest aristocratic court, the highest criminal court, and not open to the public. Political prison courts, as well as the patrol police intelligence sharing center. Every case in the trial here is a major case of alarming the whole country. In history, it has ruled that more than 40 grandfathers or princes have been guilty, and has issued hundreds of thieves’ slogans, and the law regulations adopted for each ruling. When other local courts tried the same case, the object of the dagger, Zolfa Longqi, turned his attention to the extraordinary gold-plated dome of the Judicial Hall and the wall of the antique vase. He was expressionless but his fingers kept on He buckled his knees. This is a sign of tension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long will it take to see the person in charge of the intelligence center?" Zallfa asked Jeffrey<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;His former colleague of the secretary in the Metropolitan Security Agency, "I have waited for two hours?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No hurry. Old friend, only We wait for the superiors, not the big officials to wait for us.” Jeffrey said, “The way of doing things in the West is not suitable for Tantin.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did I get into the security hall? I have the blood of the secret police in my bones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no way, the security department has strict requirements for secret agents, and you Unfinished completion, not obeying the pre-existing instructions, it is difficult to pass the review." Jeffer slammed the shoulder of Zall's law, "compared to the analyst of the patrol intelligence center, it is much easier."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, can I only be a small analyst buried in the file all day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take it easy, First mix a few years seniority, when ...... "Just then, the hall burst of noise caught their attention. Zall Law saw that a beautiful woman dressed in a uniform and tied her hair into a ponytail, looking forward to the beautiful, striding through the front hall, while walking and reprimanding the assistant behind him, "get it so for a few days." Shit evidence? How can I go to court? Do you not know how to work after leaving for a while?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, can..." Ready to explain, the beauty suddenly stopped, turned and stared at each other. "Don't call me, Your Highness, in the Judicial Office, my name is Lord Leinschmann Prosecutor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
