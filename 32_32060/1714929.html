			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous night-time carnival, so that the citizens of Feidu are unhappy and inevitably tired. On the last night of the last day of the festival, I could not see the embarrassment that lasted until the early morning. Only three or three or two kittens, squirting alcohol on the street, made a boring noisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the hilarious gods have not yet played enough. When turning the clock, the fierce screams shattered the silence of the city and weaved a messy network. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrol knight surrounded a dance group tent named "The Wizard of Oz", several citizens were yelling at the knights in horror, then ran to the side Severe vomiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forensic officer? Why haven't you come yet?" The inspector blamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, he is drunk, how can he not call it. Carnival." The guard defended the martyrdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gap stuff, I should have stuffed his head into the toilet, let him know that he has delayed the work." The inspector vomited. Spit, he knew in his heart that even the presence of a forensic doctor would not help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole twenty-one people, including the dancers, chores, bodyguards and dancers on the dance group, paid a big price, stayed in the tent and prepared for the last night. The guests were all taken away by the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the devil can do this kind of behavior. These twenty-one people were ruined, and the organs inside disappeared without a trace, but they did not even splash a little blood, as if nothing was left in the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone dies very suddenly, and his face is still looking for joy, it seems that there is too much time to show fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The damn midnight butcher." The inspector bit his teeth, clenched his fists, his knuckles were blue and white, and he sighed in anger and powerlessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the sophisticated prosecutor, in the face of supernatural powers, It seems small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in the first court, the highest-ranking person is not the chief of the general court or the chief prosecutor, but the magnate who is detached. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the world's class system is likened to a big tree, the ordinary people are undoubtedly deep roots, drawing on the contribution of nutrients; soldiers like thick bark, defense Dangerous; aristocratic knights are thick trunks; merchants are the meridians in the trunk; and the priests and kings who serve the gods are at the top, as if they are enjoying the sun's canopy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician is close behind, like the extra-leaf leaves under the treetops. This is because the cultivation of Arcane is too stressful, making the number of people in this profession too small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thousands of years, the struggles in the non-secular world, the Druids, the Warlocks... These occupations with mysterious powers are gradually being accomplices of the Holy Church. Defeated, once it is discovered, it will be sent to the declining force of the firearms. Only the mage, barely and evenly matched the church, won the right to walk under the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the secret agreement between the Master and the Church is not known to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you angered a lord, you might be able to escape to find a place in the country to hide, but provoke a magician, those mysterious spells The tracking of the Assassin assassin is also effective, so that you have nowhere to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wizard who is proficient in spiritual magic enjoys the salary of ordinary people in the first court, and the general administrative regulations cannot restrict him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in some cases involving non-secular, it is his turn to take the shot, such as the case involving another mage, alarming the country’s striking big case, Need to find evidence as soon as possible and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High salary, low work intensity, which made Fran deeply envious when he was too busy to stand on the bench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this work-free mage still brought trouble to Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murder case in which Fei has appeared continuously, obviously has the existence of unnatural factors, the patrol team turned to the first court, and the aristocratic courts belonging to the judiciary are duty-bound. The mage should be dispatched to assist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the mage, who is revered as the master of William, has not come to work for more than a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, the Master appears in the secular world, and most of them buy magic materials for the purpose of making money, so that the planned experiments can proceed smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expensive media and magical materials, even the special allowances that every registered magistrate can enjoy, is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king’s court teacher, the chief counselor of the giants, the mages usually appear in people’s eyes in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the mysterious summoning rituals and alchemy experiments are the meaning of their lives compared to the secular world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that Master William has lingered in the magic experiment and forgot the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one wants to urging a magician who is addicted to the experiment, a mage tower full of organs, and a grumpy mage who is plagued by a failed experiment. Undoubtedly it is the existence that allows the secular people to avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because private school towers, bombarded by fireballs into coke or smashed into the door of the experimental products, such rumors are not uncommon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a newcomer, the task fell to Fran's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kid has been out of the limelight recently, and it is estimated that some big people have become embarrassed." Many people think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for Fran, although there is some fear, more is still excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious magic experiment, forever the world's unpredictable spells, these all tempted Fran's curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scrape, sundries, discarded clown masks and colored balls, the street just past the carnival is messy, and the cleaners have been busy working overtime until ten o'clock More, the road has not been restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murder case at midnight last night made it impossible for the patrols to conceal the existence of the butchers. The rumors made the number of pedestrians in the streets and lanes a lot less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people with more imaginations, in the pub, vowed to say to the drinkers, "The guy can be said to be human, maybe the monster that climbed out of the abyss, hey, it’s really awkward, eat one part at a time. This time it is the internal organs, the next time it is the thigh, and it is chewed alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is amazement for the guests in the pub, but the women are even more Pale, keep turning his eyes, and find a way to find a reason to get off work early today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these words were quickly taken away by the patrolman on charges of disturbing law and order. The knights in the streets and lanes were stunned and patrol around. , do not let go of any wind and grass. There was a bad thief who lost his hand and fled, and actually led the guards of half of the column to chase after him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just stole a purse, can I commit it?" When the four or five brawny fell to the ground, the thief cried and cried. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The station was empty, only a few carriages were parked at the site, and the driver was yawning boring and frustrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the monsters in the rumors are fierce, they have to work, or what to eat tomorrow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, go to my car, make it comfortable and convenient." Seeing Fran approached, a cleverman driver hurriedly smiled and shouted. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much is going to the dock?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three silver Italians, if you don't plan When I come back in my car, I need to add another silver Italian.” The coach said, “You know, you have to pay taxes when you enter the city.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coachman saw a visitor from the peers, and they showed envious expressions. Several of them opened their mouths and slammed them back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are rules and regulations. In the circle of coaches in the station, deliberately pushing down the price and robbing each other are all unacceptable behaviors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who violated the rules, maybe one night, the wheel of the carriage will be sawn off, and even the expensive Hummer will be poisoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing, even if it’s a big man in the guild, can’t get help, but it’s notorious for ridicule and unruly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bureaucrats have the rules of the bureaucrats. The merchants have the rules of the merchants. Even if they are jealous, there are rules that belong to us. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human society is composed of rules of magnitude and size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage slowly drove out of the city of Feidu. After leaving the city, the speed suddenly increased a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The port is located in the estuary of more than 30 kilometers from the main city of Feidu. It is actually a large town with various facilities and semi-independent of the main city. Every day, countless goods are disembarked, transported to large and small shops in the city, and then circulated by shops to the place where the price can be afforded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to the port of Feidu was built to be wide and flat, enough to accommodate ten carriages at the same time, and also coated with a thick layer of black asphalt. The rich people have always been The road to finance is not awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people say that as long as you stand on this dark road for half an hour, the wealth you see is worth the rest of your life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the dilapidated roads in the old city and the speed limit of the new district in the downtown area, this road is undoubtedly a good place to drive the car. Fran puts his head out of the car. The window, enjoy the wind that comes from the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, my good gentleman, it’s too dangerous." Yu Guangtao went to Fulan’s driver and tried to turn his head and warned with the wind. There used to be a lord, so that the truck that was driven by the opposite side was hung up, and the head and the body were separated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Divided?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, separation, a blink of an eye, half a long road is dyed red." The driver exclaimed exaggeratedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than an hour, the coach of the station turned into the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan paid the money and took a few deep breaths along the roadside. The unique smell in the air of the sea was more than the farther away from the main city. Strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bluestone pavement of the port is always wet, no one can distinguish the water traces on the road, it is the relic of the waves, or the sweat of the workers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this semi-arc harbor, a small boat is unloaded and the cargo that is moored at the half-seas of the double-decked cross-roam freighter is unloaded and transported back to more than a dozen piers of different sizes. The shirtless man with his upper body and only a thick leather pad on his shoulders sipped and picked up a bundle of heavy goods and moved them to the truck yard 100 meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a long time, the double-horse trucks kept the glass, silk, seafood, and lacquerware all the time, maintaining the survival and luxury of Feidu people. Shipped to the owner's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailors who have worked hard for a few months, a swarm of bees filled all the taverns, squandering the money for the money and the girl’s body, often seeing To the drunken drunk, lying in the alley, screaming, but when the horn of the ship rang, they immediately looked at them with carelessness and embarked on a route that did not know the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire port, like a huge ant colony, seems to be chaotic and the actual division of labor is clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran avoids a group of dockers who are carrying wooden boxes, even if the box is well sealed, Fran still smells a sour pungent smell. . That should have been the leaf of the plant called marijuana that was just shipped from Turanka. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich people in Feidu like to smash the cannabis leaf and mix it into the tobacco. This kind of specially processed cigarette is expensive and scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran’s father’s notes have recorded this plant, and the cannabis leaf works well in pain relief, but it’s easy to get nervous. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the father put it into the category of "poison". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always someone who spends a lot of money on poisoning. This is called Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way down, Fran asked about the three shipping companies, and the answer was, "Mr. Dear Sir, we do not provide short-distance passenger services, and small cargo ships are not free. You may be able to check in at Pier 14 where there is a place to park a fishing boat. A small amount of money will allow the fishermen to send you to their destination like a escort king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The 14th Pier does not have an empty ship. The early fishermen set off on a small trawler in Tianweimeng, and pursued the fish of the squid, squid, tuna and sardines on the boundless sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are the Masters so lonely, like to build their homes where the birds don't lay eggs?" Fran thought helplessly, he turned into a tavern passing by, ready to fill his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tavern serving sailors and dockers has very few foods and wines, and Fran chooses fried fish and baked potato strips, plus A little mention of beer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss's craftsmanship is not bad, but the taste of the beer is rough, but the price is relatively cheap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time was spent in the pub, and Fran went to the 14th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the lucky one was born early and was busy, and was busy cleaning up the squid that was on the net, and bargaining with the old shop in the fish shop. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sixteen silver Italians can't be any more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, squid It is difficult to catch in this season, at least 30 silver Italians according to the price of last year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I am giving you ten squid." Six, if it's those sardines that are stinking and smelly, I don't think I will take a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, my handsome guy, can return to the air at one o'clock in the afternoon, you have been taken care of by Poseidon, don't be too greedy."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s called a lord, which makes the eyebrows open, but he never gives up on the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., I want to rent your boat." Waiting for a while, it seems that the debate between the fishermen and the purchase price continues until dark and can't end. Fran couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, can I help you?" The fisherman looked at Fran curiously, and it was difficult to see a well-dressed Sven in the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to go to an nearby island, about nine miles away, I am willing to repay you with twenty silver Italians."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fisherman had not had time to answer the question, and the purchase was exclaimed. "Handsome guy, are you the illegitimate son of Poseidon? In any case, you have to give me the lucky points, sixteen silvers are for you, and the squid is for me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jiu Haijun? Master, you should not go to the island with the tower?" The fisherman’s face is ugly, "It is said that there is a magician living there." If you accidentally angered him, the storm that was summoned by the spell could make my boat come back again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the "magician "Three words, the old purchase also played a chill, carefully glimpsed around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, in the eyes of ordinary people, the magician is not an object that can be easily accessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, the wizard is my colleague, and you only need to dock in shallow water."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"同僚...Day, are you also a magician?" The fisherman stepped back a few steps, shaking his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to calm your fears, I will rent out to twenty-five silver Italians." Fran did not admit it and did not deny it if he could let the fisherman drum With the courage to send him to the island, he does not mind spending more money and posing as a magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dares to reject a Master’s request, even if it is reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fisherman quickly processed the fish for purchase, and the buyer said vaguely, "I am going to find a car to take it away." Then it seems to be dead. Escaped like a run away, his hands were as strong as the light, and he returned to youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan saw that on the back of the old man, a large piece of sweat stained the shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear of these two people made Fran’s heart uneasy, all kinds of horror rumors about the Master, and Fran’s heart was tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, how to say, Mr. William and I are both working in the first court." Fran comforted himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no trace of wind on the sea, a large group of seabirds chasing the waves, collecting low flying, the whole sea is like a big mirror, reflecting the dazzling white light of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
