At the end of August, after Fran came to Byron for a month, everything went smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recommended a beautiful property in the Regal District near Silver Avenue through the recommendation of the Finance Minister, two floors, the house is quite good, the location is good, the original The owner is a diplomat who has just left the country, so the decoration is subtly different from the standard Byron architecture, and it is particularly unique in a building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a luxuriously decorated lobby on the ground floor, with walls, floors, and zenith panels, all authentic hand-carved. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor consists of six bedrooms, the top floor is not the usual arched roof, but was changed to the roof, the railings are carved with exquisite stone statues, and the building is A semi-naked greenhouse, at night, in the greenhouse with flowers and vines, placed a table, accompanied by the night wind and stars, enjoy a bottle of pure wine, is indeed a kind of enjoyment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Fran bought it, the only change was to re-tune the underground kiln again. After storing the shelves of the barrels, another small room was dug. The secret room, the instruments that were secretly transported from Weber Port, have mostly arrived. He hopes that he can start a new experiment as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s always a little trouble. When Fran moved out of the Heihe Hotel, Barry Silana was very upset. She complained, “Why are you going out alone? Live." Until Fran promised, there was a bedroom left for her, welcome to stay at home, and then stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Nicole, the head of the group already has the idea of ​​retiring, "Hey, it is estimated that the performance at the end of the Tandin Grand Theatre, then go to the morning monastery of the holy city of Anno The theater is touring once, for a maximum of one year. After all the dreams of the head of Baru have been realized, I am ready to settle down. As long as the big man proposes to her, she is not allowed to agree immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren said, "The attitude of Cosimomodo is still very vague."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, if he dares to deceive The head of the team, playing with the feelings of women, I will never let him go, all the contradictions in the script. All of them become his name." Nicole said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Fran hears this, it is estimated that he will be depressed: When did I play with Barry’s feelings? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another trouble is Matilda Hepburn, whose daughter must of course live with her father. Fran was quite upset about the samurai girl. He noticed the change of Matida, although he still had mental retardation. In the past, Matida always laughed and played innocently, and now. It often shows a dark look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran sneaked into her. Sometimes, he felt that as long as he turned around, he always had his eyes staring at himself, but he turned back and saw only Marty. Sitting in a chair and playing with fingernails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only when the little orc girl Cecilia visited, Ma Tida was alive. They have a good relationship and often sleep together like a sister. But Fran always has some strange ideas. Between Matilda and Cecilia, it seems to be the relationship between the owner and the pet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of the outside world, this is a successful man. I am enjoying my life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed the case, Lord "Casimodo Bo Knight" has a large deposit in various banks, the troupe caused by the investment troupe in the entertainment industry Sustained, the objects of communication include prominent figures such as the Crown Prince and the Finance Minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s him." Every time I walk into a restaurant or club in the Byron Regal, there is always a waiter who whispers in awe-inspiring manners. Harmony, "The millionaire who just came to Tantin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has everything that a small person dreams. When Fran is still a small prosecutor, renting a duplex apartment is not enough. On weekends, taking An Mei and Grandma to the hotel for dinner, are exciting holidays. Now he has two houses in Golden Horn Bay. There is also a villa in the port of Weber. In the residence of Byron, his neighbors are dignitaries, but when he stands in the empty hall, he feels that this has any meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He plays a variety of roles, concealing the past with false camouflage and clever lie. Revenge, this humanity's most turbulent emotions support him, unimaginable. When all the dust settles, how can he find the meaning of life in the trajectory of life that has been distorted and changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director of the Tanting Post Office of Liujin Street received a special guest at 7 o'clock in the morning and the post office was preparing to start business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guest directly presented the certificate. "I am the investigator of the Security Department."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. I don't know where I can help you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cassimodo Berkshire, is this person renting an inbox with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Please let me check..." The Secretary took a customer list from the shelf behind him and turned to the line at the beginning of "b". After half a minute, he looked up. "Yes, there is this person's name, VIP-level mailbox."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recently received this letter in this mailbox?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yesterday morning there was a message."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After being taken?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, please open his email and let me check."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., this requirement is extremely unreasonable because of the confidentiality system of this Council."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a suggestion, but an order. If you have any questions, you can appeal to the Security Department afterwards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Say, "If this incident is discovered by Mr. Knight, and the dispute arises, the Security Department will bear all the responsibilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one likes the secret police of the Security Agency They are rude and rude, and they are tempted by all sorts of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He personally took the investigator and went to a small but elegant room. On the side of the white painted wall, leaning against a solid square inbox, there is a small opening on the top of the box with a letter and a double lock on the left, except for the post office and the renter. Can open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The number of the password is set by the renter himself, but for security reasons<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp For example, the guest has forgotten his own password. Each lock has a original password." The Secretary explained the side and flipped the book. "8043, this is the case." He dialed the lock wheel and allowed the numbers to be combined. Insert the spare key into the keyhole, gently twist it, and slam the door, the mailbox door opens, and there is a letter sealed with wax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigator took out the letter and carefully looked at the wax on the envelope. "The wax seal is not covered with a private stamp, which makes it easier for us to restore afterwards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let The Secretary prepared an empty room, took out all kinds of tools from his pocket, carefully uncovered the letter and took out the stationery. This was written by a famous investment bank in Golden Horn Bay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lord of Kasimodo Boss, you have entrusted the Bank’s investment in the shipyard bond, which has already earned 160,000 net profit. We believe that it is worth selling, we almost never need to assure you that we are planning ahead, and now we can transfer the principal to another firm to get a more profitable growth point.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Bank looks forward to your reply, and has any outstanding issues. I will discuss it later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the letter simply indicates that the Knights are indeed Rich man. The investigator copied the contents of the letter in the original format and order. Then use a lighter to melt the wax strips that you bring. Re-close the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect, the most vigilant people will not notice, the letter has been taken apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran looked at the table below. At 10:20, he rode Luoxi Nantes and turned from the west side of Baiyin Avenue into Liujin Street, passing several intersections. Stopped at the gate of the Tantin Post Office and handed the horse to the receptionist at the post office for a while, and walked in slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his departure. An inconspicuous gray shed carriage slowly followed him. The style of this car is no different from that of a taxi in the street. The only difference is that there is a man in the carriage wearing a black coat. Slightly uncover the curtain on the window, staring at Fran, constantly recording the daily experience of the tracked person on the notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no doubtful point in the goal, and the behavior is completely in line with your identity." Black Dad wrote on the note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, Fran took out the letterhead from his private mailbox, put it in his pocket, and quickly left and returned to his house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medida and Lai in the "feeder" home refused to go to Cecilia, enjoying the sun on the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran closed the door and took out the letter. Looking at the wax print on the envelope, on the table in his bedroom, there was an inconspicuous flask. The fuel in this flask is not ordinary alcohol, but a higher temperature oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lit the cotton jacket of the flask, picked up the wax trace with a clip, and grilled it on the flame. For a moment, the wax melted with light smoke. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, it was investigated by the Security Department." Fran thought. It is not wax that is sealed on the letter. It is an oily fiber extracted from plants, even in the ultra-high temperature of fire oil, it will only be white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For every person worthy of attention, the Metropolitan Security Agency will investigate to determine the authenticity of identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to pass the investigation of the secret police, and his connection with the Gulf Gang will be smoother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days later, Peggy received a summary report from the investigator, this time for the investigation of the Franland, from her inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the spies are not lazy, the Kasimodo Bo Knight is an object that can be drawn, I need an assistant who can provide advice on the wisdom." Thinking, "But it's not the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't know why she looks at this ugly, Peggy only touched him twice, once The boring banquet in the Red Pavilion, another time was a small circle party of a Duke's family. Every time, Peggy always felt that he was more and more appreciative of Casimo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a knock on the door outside the office, and Zall Law Longchi took the dog and just walked back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peggy hates this half-man because he is trying to get close to himself and the act of seeking interest is too obvious. But on the other hand, I feel that Zall Law is quite capable. So she transferred him to her side as a secretary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more often, Zall Law plays the role of Missy's dog nanny. In the afternoon, the people in the Justice Department can always see, a middle-aged man with a sly face, holding a dog and strolling in the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
