			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Zolfa Longqi squatted on the street, from time to time to avoid the oncoming passers-by, after turning a few corners, he found himself Has lost people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s okay, he knows where the girl will go, in order to avoid further leaks, Zall Law believes that it is necessary to conduct a thorough investigation to ensure that there is no doubt. Hand tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Town, 11 Green Ony Street, Golden Goose Tavern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His legs are getting more and more unfavourable. When he walks for a long time, he feels sore and swollen, but he is still cautiously not looking for a taxi. The coaches of those drivers are very good. When they are asked by the police one after another, they will inevitably provide his appearance and shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When arriving at the destination, the old man was already sweating and felt that his armpit seemed to gather a small ditch, which was thick and sticky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are quietly in the building, the neon lights and the sly words that are still flashing are gone, leaving only the red lacquered large signboard and the locked door. . Lost the decorative lights and guests, the Golden Goose Tavern and the old districts have been in disrepair for a long time. It seems that there is no difference in the house that seems to be broken. It is not like the one in the old district. Lively place." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather has become humid and breezy from the afternoon, it seems to be raining, but the clouds accumulated in the sky have not broken open until 9 pm, the moonlight is bleak, making people feel Unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main entrance is hung with a wooden board, written in red chalk, "suspended for two days, the day after tomorrow is open", because of the murder, The victim is also an employee in the store. As long as something is wrong, even if it is not relevant, this half-wind place will always be implicated. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man glanced at the surrounding environment with a professional eye, facing the pub in the building, and the few windows with good sights were not found, indicating the patrol hall. After the investigation and evidence collection, it is considered unnecessary to leave the surveillance personnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not find the trace of An Mei, which made Zolfa wrinkle his eyebrows, but quickly relieved. Such a small dragon with a half bucket of water, it is impossible to find the shadow of a superb assassin in the darkness and the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I haven't come yet, I may have left. Anyway, I can investigate it more easily. The girl will not kill a woman for no reason. There is a reason for it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zall is a few laps around this independent long-story three-story house. Through an alley, with the protection of the night, I turned in from the low wall and jumped into the narrow backyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move made him kneel down, sucking in air and forbearing for a while. Then he put out a slender wire from the wallet, bent over and slammed, very old-fashioned marble locks. In less than two minutes, the guards of the gate gave up the resistance and made a "squeaky" surrender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed into it. Then close the door as it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior is filled with a touch of odor. The chairs were folded upside down on the table, the bar was full of groceries, and there were still a few unwashed dishes in the small pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first floor is a place of business. Nothing to investigate. Zolfa found a cup that looked clean from the closet on the bar, and shaken the coffee pot, which also had some unfinished drinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sipped his coffee, the impurities were a little more, but the taste was not bad, so he went upstairs and wondered if there were left-behind people. The investigator of the authorities put out some information for his analysis, but stopped operating. No customers come to the door, let the women choose to rest in the past two days, or find another job, there is not even a left-behind person inside or outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor is the most famous small room in the Golden Goose Tavern. The whole corridor is divided into seven or eight small suites. Zall Law opens a room. The door of the room has only a small cupboard, a bed and a filthy quilt that is folded in a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third floor has not been harvested. There are several staff members who occasionally stay in the room and the utility room. "It’s a white one." Zall Law looks a little Some time. I gave up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was about to leave, he seemed to hear the movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man first thought that a certain employee had returned, but immediately he changed the speculation, the voice was not from the main entrance, and the same was not invited by the host. Come privately to visit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He crept back to the second floor, flashed into a suite, and pulled the door slightly into the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Fryer attended a salon meeting with Peggy at 6 o'clock in the evening. The host was Prince Cooper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have heard of your reputation, Lord Earl of the Palace." The Prince is a spirited old man, from tone to demeanor, it is impeccable, But he also took the thoughts of the family's wealthy people. In the eyes of such real big men, Fran is just a foreign upstart who has the opportunity to get the title of Earl Byron. On the surface, etiquette is enough. There is no need to talk deeply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the Prince whispered to Peggy, "You shouldn’t come to the capital, so the officials of the Golden Horn Bay will think close. During the period, the actions of the judiciary came from the manipulation of the royal family behind the scenes. Even if they were not investigated, they would complain about their majesty. And you have no way to do it, whether it is for the royal family or the gorse. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think it is wrong to make justice and to bring out the locusts of the empire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Please don't say this kind of glorious words, I don't think you are a idealist from the Golden Sparrow's family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy shrugs "Of course, I have my own reasons, maybe, I should find a place to talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what you mean."<br /><br />&nbsp ;Franland knows that Peggy can find a bunch of rhetoric to cover up his contact with the kidnappers and be coerced. He walks over and whispers to Missy, "The House of Prestige It takes a long time, I will retire first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be free, I have no interest in the monkeys' gatherings. It seems that your hobby is similar to me." Ji did not agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran quickly left the salon. When the carriage drove towards the villa, he yelled at the driver halfway. "I just walked around the city. You don't have to follow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devotion, Sir Alex."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no purpose After a long stroll on the bustling street, I decided to rush to the Golden Goose Tavern after not paying attention to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Zall Law, he saw the sign, so he entered the interior of the house in the same way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the two families gathered together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran stood in the darkness, and the streetlights that passed through the gaps in the window fainted, patrolling the familiar pattern of the pub, with a trace of anomalies in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is quiet and very peaceful. A few years ago, he met here the favorite woman of this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I saw the girl like a playful kitten. He felt that in the monotonous life of reading the legal books and studying the case of the law, there was a new vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to kiss the bearded Mamouk merchant and choose where to deliver it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that day on, he was like going to work, every day at dusk, came to the pub to report and have a beer. Come to some side dishes and kill to proof. Not long after, all the regulars guessed the mind of this young man. People in the lower classes of Feidu may have many vulgar and rude problems, but they are undoubtedly kind and simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is called An Mei, she lives nearby." "That is a good girl, who suffers more than anyone else, if not for the care of the sick grandmother, she does not." I will do this for money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Fran figured out all her things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But An Mei rarely cares for him and doesn’t have a good expression. Only when I was ordering at Fran, I came to talk a few words in a cold voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time. He was busy at the court until 8 pm, and after all the documents were sorted out, he dragged his tired body toward the pub. Just entering the door, I heard a quarrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of the way, I don't want to do your business." He saw An Mei screaming angrily, one, the raw face, the sailor dressed in the brawny Holding her arm tightly, the girl licked her fingertips and stepped on the other's instep with her heel, but she couldn't get rid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will give you money, you have to do it." The man is obviously a little drunk, and he is drunk with alcohol. The boss advised him. I am looking for a patrolman and I am afraid to bring trouble to my store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please, I am not here, but a small room for those in need. If the girls don't want to, you can't come strong." "I don't care." The sailor squirted alcohol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl saw Fran, and suddenly stopped sulking and struggled. "Fifty I will go upstairs with you." She shouted deliberately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailor threw a stack of tickets at the bar. "There are almost seventy. There is no need to find more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp When the man thought it was successful, someone said behind him, "Sir, please stop, I just had trouble." The sailor did not know Fran, impatiently, "Is trouble? I am not a policeman." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But my troubles can only be solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, because you touched my woman." The chaotic fight began immediately, and the first punch was Fran, who slammed into the face, But the man was obviously very experienced in the fight, and he slammed his foot. Fran fell to the ground, fell down the table, and sprinkled the beer, the sailor rushed up, but again The François hooked his ankle and swept it hard. The two rolled together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, boy, I am not damn you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I and you want The same thing, the idiot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding customers are very excited, whistling, cheering loudly, most of them know Fran, but there is no helper, this is the rule, Who is looking for a punch in the fight for a girl, who is the kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss is really unable to bear the constant smashing of the tables and chairs in the store, when the patrol is called, two people are injured and hung up. Not much of each other is cheap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailor seems to have some cases. When he heard the police whistle outside the crowd, he stopped his hand and rushed toward the side door, but was blocked by the crowd, and Fran Shake With a swollen head, he also wanted to leave. At this time, one hand reached over, took him, and led him away from the back door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrol finally squeezed the crowd, put the sailor on the handcuffs, and then asked, "There is one, what? Run? Who knows? Destroy private property and shut him for two months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone shook his head. "That is a raw face, I have never seen it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That would be difficult, the police station could not do this for the case. Deliberately went to the sea to find a needle." The patrolman wrote a few words on the black booklet and asked the boss, "Do you have an impression? If you can't find someone, you can only give up." People are holding their bosses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss certainly knows Fran, but he looks at the people around him and says with anger, "I don’t know, I got one, anyway, all the money. Compensation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the vulgar kindness of the residents of the old town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect a Sir Alex, it would be a fight, that guy is at least You are strong." An Mei rubbed his chest and led the man to rush all the way, tired of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only you are a nobleman who lived in Old town. It is quite famous in this area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran touched his hair and smiled slyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, according to the rules, the girl will accompany the victorious boy." An Mei bit his lip and said softly, "Would you like to go to you? Of course This time it's free, I have to collect the money next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think we are this relationship."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Relationship? Your woman? Don't be stupid." An Mei smiled and said, "Even if you are lonely, it is also a nobleman, a serious job, and I am just a bar. Entertaining, occasionally going to bed with the guests for a living, and not feeling ashamed, people always have to live, not relying on anyone, living with their own only things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The girl’s green voice is filled with a feeling of inferiority and pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not self-deprecating, not deceiving, not guilty, living alive and well." Fran answered, "You can curse the injustice of fate, but you cannot blame yourself." The character."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
