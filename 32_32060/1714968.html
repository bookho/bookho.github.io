			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The first hearing was held in the solemn Justice Hall of São Paulo, with the same name as the city in which it was located. The megaliths are built, and the small squares in front of the gates are covered with dark red slate. The lawsuit wins, and the slate is usually praised as a rose. When you lose, you complain in disgust, like the blood of the eyes, feeling nausea. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No spread pattern, no varnish, the building deliberately retains the original features of the stone, just in the gap, with a whiter color cement Filling up, pulling down a straight white line from the top, looking at the past, it looks thick and daunting. The dome, standing with a sculpture of a double-headed eagle, the architect deliberately exaggerated the shape of the eagle, as if the legendary dragon was standing on the cliff's lair, the double-headed eagle spread its wings, one head headed to heaven, the other, Down, ** fist-sized eyelids are looking down at the main entrance of the Justice Department. It seems that everyone who walks through the gate will have the illusion of being stared invisibly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light from the outside can make visitors believe that this is the most just place in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The square is full of carriages, which can be identified from the hidden places of the exquisite cars, the carved emblems, all of which belong to a person with a status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left side of the Justice Department is the courtroom of the aristocratic court. The entrance is strictly controlled by the guards. Only the proof that you are qualified to come here will be released. Many people met acquaintances or enemies in front of the door, but they politely restrained their emotions, but nodded friendly or angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western aristocrats care about this trial, the outcome of the case represents the future direction of the Emperor Tantin’s policy and this trend is good or bad for them, how response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Karl Tiven, the prosecutor of the Circuit Court." The guard whispered the identity of someone in the crowd, looking up and down the man, gray Hair, the horns extend all the way to the earlobe. Like the moustache, it is neatly decorated, wearing a dark six-button coat and a hard-collar shirt that are common in the judiciary. "You can go in." The guard said that he pointed to the passage behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not add any compliments in the usual time, may cause the guards to lose their jobs, but today is different, the count, the baron. He has seen so much that he can't afford to waste energy and lips for a small prosecutor in a country court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Fran took the documents and walked through the central aisle to the courtroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is fortunate that his ability to transform into the ground can still be used. Otherwise, the ugly big man is dressed up like a slang, and he is like a horrible terrorist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only worry, the magic ring that is melted by the flame and combined with the fingers, can not maintain a stable three-day variant. He didn't want to suddenly change back to his original appearance during the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lucky. I need to be lucky." Fran cheered for himself, and in the corner of the aisle, he reached the group of people in front. There was a familiar back, and when he walked over with doubts, the figure was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be the room that entered the end of the corridor, but specially guarded the guard at the door, looked at Fran and looked around, asked: "Mr. "Need help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I came to attend the case of Dalmark's succession, but unfortunately, lost." Fran smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you have passed. Go back a few steps and turn from the channel on the right."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran had no choice but to turn back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until sitting on the stool in the courtroom, he is still burying memories, who is that? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spacious interior is quickly filled with people, with the most distal judges----, hundreds of auditoriums, fanned backwards , each row of chairs. It must be slightly higher than the previous row, and some theaters. There are two long tables in the center of the courtroom. The prosecutor and the lawyers representing the Dalmak family will sit on the table and debate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five minutes later, the judge first arrived, behind him, was the Viscount, the lawyers, and the Martidas surrounded by the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is wearing a light yellow dress, the hair is carefully taken care of, the hair is dotted with a small hair clip, like a delicate beautiful doll Pity. She looked very quiet, even a little embarrassed, her eyes were empty and empty, Fran suspected that the girl was forcibly fed with anesthetic drugs, otherwise, with her current mental state, she should cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beat of the hammer, the noisy auditorium quickly calmed down, silence shrouded the entire room, and occasionally a few vague whispers were heard. The atmosphere in the venue was dignified and depressed, making people feel quite uncomfortable. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge looked around seriously for a while and said, "Before the trial, ladies and gentlemen, please note that because the noble royal family proposed the right to inherit the Baron of Dalmac. Questioning, so it is mediation rather than trial, the court will not have any accused. The baron is dying, and the first heir, Darmak Paris, is young and has limited behavior. Her will will be by her relatives. The Viscount was conveyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge in the hands of the judge slammed on the table, the trial officially began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the royal family is the famous chief prosecutor of the Tantin Court, Bai Tutai, this is a very experienced veteran, Fran In that year, he studied many classic cases that he tried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, for decades, have anyone heard that Baron Darmark has admitted that he has a daughter? And now, when he is confused, he will be confused On the occasion of the Lord's grace, we were surprised to learn that the Baron actually had heirs, as if he had come out from the cracks in the stone. Hey, Lord Heber, please prove that she is indeed the old baron's dear, the law only believes in the evidence. There is no evidence to veto."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran knows that Bai Tutai likes to come to this game, waiting for his opponent to play cards, and then overthrow them one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dalmark has no evidence that the prosecutor is speechless, otherwise the lawsuit will not appear. The circumstantial evidence of others is used to describe the things that have happened in more than a decade. The more you talk, the easier it is to find loopholes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In court, what is required is a fatal blow, and those rumors that are useless will have counterproductive effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is me, it will do the same." Fran thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representative of the lawyers group stood up, "Please summon Mott as the first witness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Mott is the baron's old housekeeper. After he was seated, the lawyer began to ask, "Mr. Mott, how many years have you worked for Lord Baron?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forty years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After sixteen years ago, did the baron have a young lover and made her pregnant?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, completely correct, the lord also gave her a special shawl for the family son-in-law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawyers I indicated that the yellow-white shawl was presented. "Is this one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you tell us that the Baron and her children are male or female?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Daughter."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does his daughter have a name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dalmark Paris."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, the lawyer summoned four witnesses, the employer of the manor and the local residents, all confirmed that Darmak Paris did exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida, not far from Baitu Taichao, glanced, "Mr. Mott, I am very surprised, I believe everyone present is as strange as I am." The baron had a daughter but didn't admit it. I had to wait until 16 years before letting her come to the courtroom to fight the lawsuit that she could have avoided many years ago?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the lord doesn't like this daughter at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much do you like?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lord didn't even look at her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As far as I know, Miss Paris, along with her mother, is in a few After the year, I was driven out of the manor and lived on the streets?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer protested, “His judge, the prosecutor’s question is meaningless, just wasting everyone’s Time, please understand that the baron lord does not like his daughter, purely a family private affairs..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Baitutai interface, "I am just in Think, one when Those who don't care, appear in front of me after more than ten years. Even if the baron himself can't be sure that this stranger will be his own daughter, then, as an outsider, what reason can you confirm than the baron? Miss, is it really Dalmac Paris?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
