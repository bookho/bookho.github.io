			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Inquiring ** to satisfy your boring curiosity is one of human bad habits. The scene of a car accident, the building of a fire, the remains of a suicide person, are always surrounded by a spectator who pretends to care. A small matter, if it appears in front of the public, will soon be full of wind and rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often use gossip lovers or long tongues to describe this group of habits. In fact, they are dressed, they are vultures, always pay attention to decaying bodies. The misery of unrelated people is regarded as a spiritual nourishment, and happiness is obtained from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius is careful to guard his secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean doctor is the ally of the Crown Prince. His external identity is a close-knit doctor, and he is always at risk for a minor illness such as a cold in his temple. Good medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a thin and concave middle-aged man with a golden eyeglasses, who likes to wear a steady gray suit, and the shoes are always clean. Bright, talkative, and trustworthy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few people know that the doctor had been in the laboratory of Professor Foyd, a contemporary morbid psychology authority for six years, was a professor. The ancestral traitor has considerable standards and cognition for the complex discipline of psychology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The nightmare often appears. Sometimes, I can’t control myself. I don’t know the boundaries between dreams and reality.” Julius lay on the couch. Close your eyes and sigh, "Help me, doctor, I don't want to hurt anyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must be calm, my Highness." "As I said before, it is not shameful. Everyone, more or less, will have a shadow in the bottom of my heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doctor, me I only believe in you, but I am afraid of myself." Julius was full of sorrows, and he whispered in a whisper. "What have I done! I have a very cute cat, covered in white, with a furry big tail." Every day, when it dawns, it will climb to the side of the pillow, licking my face and yelling for food. But that morning, it died, the stomach broke open, the bright red intestines flowed out of bed, others thought it was I loved it too much, and I slept with it. As a result, when I turned over in my dreams, I pressed it." The Crown Prince sat up fiercely. Growl, "I did it right, yes I did?!" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"Relax, this is just a small tragedy." Tien pays attention to every subtle expression of the patient. He clasps Julius's hand and feels that the other side's palm is sweaty and hot. "When people are under stress, they always think about shifting, fighting, quarreling, crying, smashing dishes, and occasionally appearing. The pressure is released to some weak animals, but then you are just a child, don't know How to vent, there is no moral concept of self-discipline. Hey, now that you grow up, know that it is better to use rationality to control **?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juli Gass gasped for a long time to calm down. "You are right, especially those medicines.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The efficacious is always calming me, expelling The devil who lives in his heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, take a deep breath, you need to relax, take medicine, go back to the room, remember to open the window and keep the air flowing. It is good for the disease."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the employer after going out. Dr. Tyan pushed the glasses and went to the desk. He took out a thick notebook from the locked drawer and began to record the progress of the disease under the desk lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very sympathetic to Julius, always trying to help this deeply troubled royal youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor developed a new drug with a unique and unique effect, and he did two psychological counseling for the Crown Prince every month, pulling the patient back to the normal life track. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only...the original wild instinct, originally in everyone's heart, such as a child, eagerly pinches the ants and seeks excitement and happiness. But sociality, identity with morality and order, and gradually mature rationality and self-control make this instinct die and be suppressed. My patient originated from childhood, living in a lonely environment, and receiving too much expectation. Strict spurs with the father, traumatic in the spirit, and because of the honor of identity, rarely blamed, lack of educational guidance, let the original animal nature grow up, showing a personal tendency. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor put down his pen and licked his eyes, thinking, "It’s not too late, drug control and psychoanalysis have worked, in time." He can recover completely. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be something behind me, the light from the desk lamp reflects a faint shadow and shakes on the wall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tean turned his head in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of confidentiality, during the honeymoon, every time the Crown Prince performs psychoanalytic treatment, he will choose when Peggy is not around, Julius orders All the attendants are far away, and no one is allowed to approach the snoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The psychiatrist lives in a double-storey building on the left side of the palace, the melodious piano is coming from a distance, there is a private banquet held by his wife. In the main building lobby, the participants were some judges in the judiciary, and he slid out of the habit of excuses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun has fallen just after seven o'clock in the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are weak, not physically but mentally." In the hallway, the ghost of the sorcerer said through consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let you laugh, my mind sometimes has a glitch, thanks to Mr. Tiean, I have improved a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But do you really believe that doctor? Friends, please forgive me for being outspoken. An emperor’s heir, if he is known to have a serious illness, will be in politics. If you want to, you can earn a lifetime of wealth by selling secrets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tian is trustworthy, has taken care of me for three years, mouth and The medicine is as reliable. I have the secret of serious mental illness, only myself and him are clear, even the father does not know. Oh, I have added you now." Julius smiled, he touched his pocket, said irritably, "Oops, the medicine has already been eaten yesterday, I forgot to take the new one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The bell sounded rhythmically, Julius turned his neck in confusion, dazzling, blurred sights flashing countless snowflakes Spots. He blinked, feeling sore, his head was like being hit by a heavy hammer, and there was a tingling tingling pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness of the faintness, he looked at the sound, finally let the eyelids aim at the focal length, the pointer of the radium gold bell smeared the overnight light agent, With a slight fluorescence, the display appears to be eight o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, I am coming to take medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was a mess, scattered paper debris spread throughout the room, and the table was tripped over. A table lamp fell to the ground, still not completely damaged, and there was still light shining through the flash. In the range of light, a bright red liquid was flowing slowly and quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood? Who is injured? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a few steps, was stung by something, almost fell, and he reached out and touched it. But immediately shrunk back, it is the human body. I don't know if it is wind, or the floor is too flat. The desk lamp rolls a few times and the light is shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the orange dim aperture, he saw a painful and miserable face, his lips were bruised, his eyes were raised, his eyes were almost extruding, his body Strangely twisted. Broken a lot of bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor? Dr. Tyan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hugged the body with a little temperature. Caressing his chin, mouth-to-mouth artificial respiration, squeezing the other's chest. But the hopeful heartbeat and pulse have long since disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius was extremely alarmed and just wanted to yell, a voice said to him, "Keep silent, it will be harmless to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who!" He looked around for a long time before he discovered that the ancient soul in the stone was warning him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should know who did it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this! God. You will swear for me to keep a secret forever!" Julius's face is morbidly pale, he Waving the notebook in his hand, "You actually glared at me and recorded everything! Then, you want everyone to know, I am a madman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Calm, I am for you, Your Highness." Dr. Tyan appeased. "This is a normal diagnostic process. Every doctor will write a medical record. As a reference for your condition, your psychiatric treatment will take a long time. You can't always put all the details in your mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't believe him, he is not prepared to keep you loyal, but to wait for the price and sell a good price. Hey, how detailed the writing, anyone who gets this note will find out the truth. "In my mind, ghost Just the right time to stimulate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It says, you want to sell me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One can protect my ghost!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, you are in the cycle of symptom onset Inside, so began to produce delusions and auditory hallucinations, the brain can not think clearly, come, lie down, eat medicine, let the body and mind calm down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Julius hesitated and hesitated, I don’t know who to listen to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean’s doctor made a big mistake. He said something that should never be said. “Maybe I can call the Prince to go down, but she should know the truth. According to the research, the family members can participate in the treatment and can give the patient great comfort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost silently shouted, "If you are cherished wife, find the husband If you have this disease, what do you think will happen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t let Peggy know that she will abandon me! She will not tolerate her husband, actually a madman with mental disabilities! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This horrible imagination is full of Julius’s mind. He is confused and unable to think. He only thinks that the doctor is going to harm him, to break up his family, to let him Become the biggest laughing stock of Byron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are full of blood, this gentle and graceful young, at this moment the face is distorted like the devil of hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius suddenly smiled, his lips screaming with a hint of arrogance, "Hey, doctor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is like an elegant gentleman, who is dancing to a lady at the ball, and the expression is very different from the expression. "Are you going to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What am I doing?" Julius finally remembered. He wanted to vomit. The strong sense of guilt was like a dress made of thorny thorns, which made him feel painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s your job, friend, you are really sick." The ghost sighed as if it had not helped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What to do, what should I do!" Indecisive nature without opinion, at this time revealed, he begged for the help of the ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t panic, everything is listening to me. It’s just an accident. Everyone will continue to think that you are a good prince, and you will eventually get your wife’s hottest Love." In the consciousness, the ghost whispered, like playing the night song that reminded me to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s smug to laugh, it’s going smoothly, everything is under control. A body with a sound spirit will resist the intrusion exclusively when the soul is infused, which is not a good carrier for resurrection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you remember correctly, this fool's medicine involves quite a deep botany and chemistry, only the ghost doctor can skillfully deploy, and there is not much left. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the body of Dr. Tyan was found by a servant who came to clean the room, a strong tendon rope tied to the ceiling of the ceiling, let him Hanging in the air, slightly swinging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am hurting him. Yesterday, I had a little cold. I went to the doctor and took some medicines. But this, the old man made a mistake and took a chemical experiment. The mineral powder used gave me, so I blamed him for a few words, jokingly saying that if he made another mistake, he fired him. Unexpectedly, Mr. Tyan actually did not commit the following and committed suicide." Julius sounds hoarse, blushing Red. The servants knew that His Royal Highness and the court doctor had a good relationship. I didn’t expect a joke to be a tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of being implicated in the royal family, in order to avoid spreading into a scandal, everything is simple, the doctor has no relatives, and after a sloppy autopsy, Tyan’s body is quickly I sent it to the tomb and buried it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one doubts another hidden truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
