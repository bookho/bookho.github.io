			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-street plaza is still crowded with people. At 6:00, a horse-drawn carriage is appearing in the crowd, and the brown-yellow carriage is covered with colorful feathers. Covering the exquisite flower carvings, the leather ceiling is decorated with a small bronze crown, the wheels are painted red, and more funny, the two horses of the tall horse are tied with long silk on the forehead. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the master is making a big splash in the carnival, transforming the carriage into a magical speeding car driven by the gods in mythology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The groom on the squatter, did not wear anything in the upper body, only on the right shoulder to the waist, pulled a white wide cloth belt, wearing a laurel leaf Crown, the temperature in the evening is very low, so that the driver who is dressed as a god makes his nose red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Riddle looked at Fran at a glance, and the two-meter big man was very conspicuous in the crowd. He waved his hand and called Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabin is spacious, with several layers of velvet, even the seats are removed, passengers can comfortably lie on the cushions, the wine hanging from the inner wall In the cabinet, take out the good red wine and enjoy it in a lyrical manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich usually classify the carriage and modify it according to the purpose. Vehicles like this are only suitable for short trips. The long and half-lying position is definitely a torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocratic youth was looking at Fran, until it was confirmed that he had no scorpions on his body and even his nails were clean and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "People rarely have you so clean, to be honest, they are all swollen pigs." Riddle's tone made Fran disgusted. And yes, this is a compliment to him, but Fran would rather have this compliment as little as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today's blessings have not only saved my life, but also brought love." Riddle found the topic, he did not deal with civilians. Experience, "She is a young lady in the high circle of Tantin, who is in the limelight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There must be a lot of work."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, like Luzi Mavoro, the son of the Marquis, himself has the title of a baron," Riddle said of the name of the competitor, "almost I was in front of me, hey, just think about the beauty of Naomi, it’s worth the little injury in the afternoon.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before there is a real relationship, it doesn't matter." Fran knows this guy and likes this topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a point of words." Riddle shouted cheerfully, "Woman! Gorgeous diamond, sparkling pearl! Not really put in I can't take it lightly before the box."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may not give up the Baron Mavolo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, he is this virtue." Riddle was a little worried. "The Naomi family is rich. It is useless to send some jewelry and other things. It is harder to win her heart than to capture a bunker. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When party, can you invite her to dance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She already Promise, the first dance and me jump."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, don't do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What?" Riddle asked strangely. "This is a good opportunity to further strengthen the relationship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no dance can represent anything. To be honest, just afternoon, your heroic and Injury, the lady was somewhat embarrassed to compensate." Fran concluded, "Once the dance is over, she will think that she will pay back, no longer owe you, then your position in her mind, and others It’s at the same level.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ridel’s eyebrows are tight, “Think about it, there is such a possibility, what should I do?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let her continue to feel sorry, but don't go too far. When she dances with others, you have to look at it with sad eyes. Please note that the lady must be aware of it. At this point, she will always be curious, what's wrong with you? Why don't you follow the agreement?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than half of the ball to invite her, but the injury has not recovered, tolerate Pain. This way, not only reflects your love, but Miss Naomi will become more sympathetic to you after we realize it. We all know that sympathy and curiosity can make women take the initiative to approach you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great!" Riddle looked at Fran in an incredible way. "With yours Appearance, can be so understand women ...... "He seems to think that some words before, corrected himself and said," I profoundly apologize for negligence, did not know what to call you. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Casimodo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Cassimodo, I am Riedel Don Leinschmann," Riddle said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Day, Leinschmann!" Fran was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you heard of the family name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most stupid people also Know the glory of the gorse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This respectful remark makes Riddle very comfortable, and Fran’s ugly face is more and more loved, "monthly Give you ten golden Caesars and come to be my advisor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive me, I am very satisfied with the current work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refused to make Riddle somewhat unhappy, this time the carriage stopped in front of a mansion, the young man’s mind immediately threw this little unhappiness behind him, he jumped off the car The attendant in front of the house greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord Leinschmann, the host is waiting for you for a long time." The attendant looked at Fran, "Is this?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Casimomod, my companion." Riddle raised the volume. "He came down from my private carriage and could walk intimately beside me. You actually used doubt. In the tone, ask him about his identity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello!" The waiter shook, he didn't want to lose his job for this little thing, "Please forgive me." Take the liberty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mansion has been around for a few years, and the architectural style is still the old castle-like style, full of green furry ivy, the large iron gate is open Many carriages have been docked in the front yard. It seems that many guests have already arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on the marble road, Riddle sneaked to Fran, "This is the industry of Earl of Trafalgar, although the Earl has moved to the Imperial City, but still The old house was left behind, and his nephew, just come to the carnival."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a carnival in Tantin?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you say that in Tantin, there are a group of old people who are in charge, or they are free to pay." Riddle suddenly lowered his voice. "The dance seems to have begun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Don't forget my words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ridel immediately slowed down, and in order to be realistic, he also took out the makeup box and applied some to his face. White powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it does, I will not treat you badly," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran slowly followed Riddle and gave a playboy a plan to pursue a girl. Two years ago, he could never do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am also changing, maybe, this is degeneration." Fran thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vengeance of revenge makes the mind a pile of ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the ruins, the re-establishment will be the temple, or the magic palace, only time will tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran as much as possible, choose the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, the brisk waltz is playing a romantic movement, and the ceiling chandelier on the ceiling is covered with a translucent color cover, letting the atmosphere of the room linger Mei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a row of dining tables on the left side, filled with honey-made snacks and exquisite food. The young people in their early 20s are at the party. For them, , food, can be far from the important girl in front of me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naomi is chatting with several pursuers, but she seems absent-minded, looking around from time to time, waiting to see Riddle come in, lovely to him Shantou, indicating "I still have the first dance." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All goes according to plan, and when the party is over, the girl has already eaten and laughed in Riddle's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran sat in the corner, calmly watching the playfulness of the nobles and buddies, no one would pay attention to such small people. If anyone inadvertently looks into the corner, he will tremble and discover how cold and sharp his eyes are in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
