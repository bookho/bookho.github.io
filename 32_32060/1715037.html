			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. "I only need you to do one thing now." Lauvita smiled and put her hand on the godfather's shoulder, squinting her head. A beautiful vortex appeared on the cheek, and in Dick’s eyes, this smile was no different from the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lavetta's rainbow model, quietly smeared a layer of strange green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Characteristics: 52 years old... Weakness search: blood viscosity is slightly higher than ordinary people...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within three seconds... Increase the likelihood of cerebral thrombosis to a thicker..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is pleased to see that Dick’s face is iron blue Falling on the carpet, the eyeballs trembled, and the limbs were like a frog with a skinned skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that he is excited because of a stroke." Lauvita seems to pity a sigh. "I wanted to talk to him. But The girl turned her head to Fitch. "In forty-eight hours, I have to find the woman and, to help her escape, a secret policeman named Zolfa Longch."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small town along the avenue to the south, four hours from Tyrol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich coffee scent does not dilute Paris’s anxiety. She is suspicious looking at the silver pot, shuttle between the restaurants, and keep a cup for the guests. The waiter, who was suddenly pushed by the new customers who had recently pushed the door, was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mouth of a woman who is ignorant of the six gods, it is very simple for Zall Law to find out what he wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The liar, on the left middle finger, has a raised hard cymbal, and the Lord of the Knights, in the same position, has the same signs." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is acting as a prosecutor, picking up Paris, and participating in the case of the inheritance rights in the west, he once admitted to the troupe, he personally recognized Cassie. Modo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the middle of the performance of Dawn Fort, the little Matida suddenly appeared, and after leaving the night, the two were married as fathers and daughters. "The troupe." "At the time, Paris was just a small supporting role with few plays, so she could have a leisurely observation. Only she noticed that Matida was not like a mentally disordered person at the beginning."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The way Casimodo leaves the tent is not like, daughter, old, but... escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The crow made a lot of money in the Golden Bay. In the case of fraud, Casimodo disappeared; while Quasimodo came to Tantin as a foreign aristocrat, and the crow never appeared again. "There are countless new clues in the brain of Zall Faw. Crashing, let him feel that the head began to hurt slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a former secret police who arrested the crow for his fate, he followed the other two years and analyzed the crow’s identity and residual clues all the time. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, except for the crow himself, only he knows the opposite of this fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two of them are the same person?" Zallfa boldly speculated, but immediately shook his head for this absurd idea. No matter how perfect the tolerance is. It is impossible to create two very different people. He does not understand the magic of Austrian law, wisdom is confined to the common sense of the world, and can no longer dig deep into the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most reasonable explanation is that they are all the same secret criminal organization, one person is in the Ming, one is in the dark, division of labor and cooperation." Touching the back of the coffee cup handle, he pulled out a black-skinned notebook filled with hunt ideas, and struck a thick line between the names of the cycleons and the crows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being, the excitement is thrown away, and Zall is looking up at Paris, "The Cardinal Theatre...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy the murder...The slayer is assassinated..." This stupid woman is actually unintentional. I have done such a ridiculous thing, and, until now, I have not understood what I have done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that Tantin will soon be able to dig out the truth from the assassin’s mouth, and the order is also on the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s better, since the Assassin is coming to Casimodo. And he has considerable evidence to confirm the identity of the Lord's criminals, then it is easy to lead Miss Peggy's anger to the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We should call the police." Zall said that he had sipped his coffee and said, "The kidnapping of you is a gang in the field, and their purpose. It is not as simple as extorting a sum of money.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the police can protect you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should now get rid of this woman, as to whether she was caught by the gang, or was officially sent to the trial court for sin, it is not off His business.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris nodded and agreed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a temporary stop The town police station, the facilities are rudimentary, the police have no guns. If they are traced by the gangs, they cannot guarantee their own safety.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tyrolean. There is a patrol general office there. "Zall law is making a decision. He is going to use official status and, under the protection of the police, swaying back to Tantin.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bought two wigs, one Black, a chestnut, also bought a few ordinary clothes, disguised, let them look like a simple small business.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the public carriage, he took Paris and returned safely to Tyrolean in the afternoon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tyrolean patrol has four hundred police officers armed with teeth. There are no gangsters, and dare to confront them directly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zorf went into the patrol hall and looked at the front desk, surrounded by several citizens who had stolen their wallets. So, I am in a good mood, and I am in the same position.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he returns to the capital, he is ready to personally open the mouth of the cycleon Kathy, and personally lead the team. To arrest the crow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war with the crow is finally over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big On the wall, a recently-published overnight notice made the smile of Zor's mouth happy and instantly solidified.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zolf Lungi, An agent of the former Western Dark Police Department, who is currently the secretary of the Justice Department of Tantin. He is suspected of being involved in a recent rebellion case. His whereabouts are unknown. He is expected to provide clues and the authorities will reward..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He trembled a little and looked at his sketches on the notice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
