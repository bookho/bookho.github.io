			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months ago, the catastrophic trial caused an earthquake-like change in the fees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The politician involved in the verification of the case file, the patrolman of the personal protection witnesses demoted under various pretexts, and several prosecutors were also implicated in this, the Royal Court of Constantine A number of commissioners were dispatched to fill the vacancies in personnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Zemen, the chief of the court of Mingzhe, is clear that he is silent at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Peggy privately conveyed the goodwill of the family. As a graduate of the Royal Law School, she was transferred to Feidu, just to be able to The judicial community of the city has gradually become the privileged scope of the gorse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will return to Tantin soon, so you don't have to worry about your position. Reinschmann is very appreciative of your mastery of the law." Peggy Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get it, it's a tough situation, and Leinschmann must have made a lot of effort." Carmen thought, but the situation is better than people, he is full Laughing, I used the elders to kiss the younger generation’s kisses. “I express my heartfelt gratitude. After returning to the capital, I must convey my gratitude to your father, the distinguished Grand Duke.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Peggy’s return, it seems to be inadvertently asked, “How will Frye Flyer arrange it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a detailed investigation, the 300,000 gold Caesar in his account did not exist, and the bank also said that this was entirely caused by misoperations during internal transfer. By convention, he would be dismissed from the position of direct prosecutor. The third court went."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Miss has some regrets, the bank has only agreed to provide temporary false accounts with her, and then sent a wrong transfer with a careless accountant. The head of the check is clarified to the public and the accounts are adjusted back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the credit-first bank, it is the biggest compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, forcing a financial institution to lose credibility is not in the interests of the family. In the elders and several palace ministers, there are still many dissatisfied with Reinschmann. People. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chancellor of the Exchequer is one of them. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the Emperor’s Highness has been worried about the phenomenon of the aristocratic powers. This Highness seems to want to make up for the decentralization of the First Emperor St. George VII. The mistake has always been to find opportunities to pick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s okay to do some small tricks for personal grievances. Too much fire will inevitably make your father doubt his ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The struggle for rights within the family is not inferior to a group of wild cats who smell awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the giant of every person, the inevitable contradiction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you are too compassionate, and he must be fully responsible for the stability of the judicial system," Peggy said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief of the General Court nodded quickly, "Just do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, didn't let The guy closed his life in the prison for half a lifetime, and he was lucky." Peggy was a little more pleasant. "Before I left Feidu, if he could come to ask, maybe I would give the opportunity an unprecedented chance, but that When I wear the dirtiest shoes, let him lick it ten times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The late heat in the late summer and the light rain in the autumn make the air of Feidu become sticky, always let the pedestrians feel that the skin seems to be wrapped in a film that is invisible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei walked briskly to avoid large and small mud pits on the road, and went north along the main road of the old district toward the 13th detention center of Feidu. The rain was not big, but the wind was blowing very fast. The girl’s umbrella was blown to the bottom. After a few times, she smacked the umbrella together and walked under the eaves like a kitten. The tiny raindrops hit Wet and beautiful blonde hair, but it does not affect An Mei's good mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is the day when Fran was released for two months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the clean streets of the new district and the perfect drainage system, the roads in the old town are simply muddy roads in the countryside, and then carefully, Anmei’s trousers are still stained. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl really missed the home of the Copper Roof Apartment in Ram Street, but the lover who was in prison for investigation, and the account that was temporarily frozen, so that she could not afford the rent, a little cash, only simple home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the old district house is cheap enough, otherwise she can only take her grandmother and puppy Black Jack to sleep on the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all difficulties must be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her man is finally free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss An Mei, it’s my pleasure to meet on the street." Halfway, a carriage stopped in front of Anmei, just blocking it. The relatively clean passage, the 13th court chief judge, Al Duna, smelled his head and greeted him enthusiastically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, thank you, but I am very busy, please let the car go." An Mei picked a beautiful brow and said impatiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this man who ran around after Fran’s imprisonment, the girl felt disgusting. In two months, she refused at least 18 appointments. Invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I have a husband." An Mei showed him the engagement ring on his finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ayre smiled at the head of the oil. "In the upper class, in addition to the husband, there are several lovers of the knight who are normal. This is an elegant tradition." He tempted this. A girl born in a low profile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, in our country, if you can't be loyal to your husband, you will be driven out of the village." An Mei answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how good it is to say, this person is not ignorant, like a fly around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please don't hurt me to give up for love." Ayr seems to like reading romance novels. "If you see a beautiful lady in the rain, Instead of offering your own coat and carriage, you can't be a gentleman. Please get on the bus and we will go to the tasteful salon for a drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anmei Pull the trousers up and step on the mud to bypass the car. "If it is a gentleman, don't stalk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acting chief judge changed his face. Originally, he wanted to seduce Fran's lover. After playing it, he immediately abandoned it and retaliated against the hatred of his former position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A district that has never seen the world, a girl who has been a rogue, when a man is held in jail, even a decent piece of jewelry can not afford, slightly With a little sweet talk and money, it’s not a hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ayr is confident in his own appearance and identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually not used a few times, many girls who want to become a phoenix, will softly hand over the innocent body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he soon discovered that this girl was as bad as the damn Flair, and it was not easy to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impetuous judge yelled, "Don’t pin your hopes on Flair. He is finished, don’t pretend to be chaste, is it a sparkling necklace and gorgeous? Skirt, don't you want to? Or after a few years, the poor days will turn you into an ugly old woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Too special, "The magnificent house, beautiful jewelry and clothes are very good things. Unfortunately, I don't like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn I hate the Flair family." Ayr sat back in the carriage and thought with a deep and distressed voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain gradually stopped, the buildings on both sides of the road slowly grew scarce, and few people were willing to live next to the detention center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the thick wall of the prison and the heavily guarded door appeared in An Mei’s eyes, the girl suddenly became nervous. She secretly hid to the side of the road and found a A relatively clean puddle, with the reflection of the water, use your fingers to comb the wet hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope I don't want to be too embarrassed." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it looks beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When An Mei was stunned with a mouth When turning around, the lover who separated for two months was standing behind, and the food was not good. He looked thinner, his face was dry, his hair was like a bird's nest, but his eyes were still bright and clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei flew to Fulan's arms and finally couldn't help but cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the beloved girl, let her vent a pass, Fran smiled and said, "Go, let's go home."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." The little wild cat looked up and couldn’t care about the tears that wiped the corners of his eyes. "Let's go home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;佩After a week, Ji learned about the news of Fran Freire's marriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the wedding was very shabby, and no one asked, the only one who was present to congratulate was the inspector of the patrol hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father of the city has urged him several times, let her return to Tantin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Royal Court, there is a large prosecutor position waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Miss does not know why she hesitated for several days before she went on the road, as if she was expecting something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the carriage surrounded by the private guard, she thought about it for a long time, but still didn't want to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy just forgot, that was only stewed into a delicious dog, how care she was, how much she loved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who don’t like it, haven’t invested in feelings, they don’t even qualify for Missy’s toys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church’s closure of the city was finally abolished in the early autumn, even the emperor His Royal Highness did not expect that the Holy Warriors still had nothing to gain in three months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most tax-rich city becomes a parasite that can be invested and supported, not the intention of His Royal Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the face of the Holy See has been given, and there is no need to ruin the interests of his country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please understand that the closure of the city must be lifted, but the Knights can still collect fees, and Tantin can only promise this." Emperor The special envoy said to the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feidu has regained its vitality. Although the number of merchant ships is much less than before, everyone believes that in less than half a year, Fei will become the most prosperous commercial metropolis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Fryer sent six cover letters after the wedding, all of which were the jurisdictions of several big cities, but no news, he waited for two After a week, the only refusal to reply was because the personnel officer was curious about what was wrong with the lawsuit. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the initial routine, the letter said that there is currently no idle errands, and then a few paragraphs are full of enthusiasm to ask the details of the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran directly threw the letter into the trash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe a good position in a big place is overcrowded." Fran thought, he lowered his request, only sought the work of a secretary, or failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former prosecutor who was unemployed began to look into the small township court and sent a dozen letters entrusted with hope. He refused to give up, even not leaving home, not leaving the desk, I believe there will always be a place to hire him, for fear of missing the notice of being hired because of the temporary departure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as he can return to the court and return to the court where he can make the dream come back, Fran is willing to live for twenty years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited so silently every day, didn’t want to move, only when he heard the bell of the mail truck outside the house, he jumped up and rushed to the window, hope Can bring good news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But every time, you can only look at the mail truck from the outside with a disappointing gaze and gradually go away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three months passed quickly, and the deposits that were still surplus, because of the previous bail and the liquidated damages that were deducted when the first court was expelled, There are very few left. The money at home was quickly filled into the rent, food, and grandma’s medicine. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dishes on the table have meat and soup from Dunton, and they have been replaced with potatoes. After eating potatoes for several days, Fran complained to Anmei. "Can't we drink some fish soup?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Jack, this half-sized shepherd dog, is in a good period of long body, and also follows Complaining that potatoes should not appear on the menu of carnivores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei nodded and went out in a small coat. When she came back in the evening, the girl smiled and glared at a net of sardines and beef. It was just that beautiful, and the coat embroidered with lace at the collar was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I went to the market outside the city to buy, the fish there is cheaper than the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, it is not much cheaper. You have to wait for the price of the four silvers in the carriage. You can count the price difference." Fran didn't bother with the cleverness of women shopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢." An Mei still smiled, until she walked into the kitchen, the girl showed a painful expression, kept her feet, she did not tell her husband, herself It is going to the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that dinner, Fran was very fragrant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the broken diamond necklace, the gold foil pocket watch, and the high-end sofa chair disappeared slowly, An Mei asked and asked, "Is it right?" "Work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Fran’s roaring frightened her. "Do you even believe that I can return to the judiciary?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come, you will definitely be able to go back." An Mei promised, "You can write with confidence, and give me other things."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, An Meila returned a small wooden trailer and a pile of pots and pans, got up in the morning, bought a few large bags of vegetable meat, washed and washed in the kitchen. One morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is noon, crispy and refreshing dish, golden fried fish steak, fragrant soup and boiled greens are all done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a small trailer towed to the market, you can sell a light in less than two o'clock, Anmei called this a box lunch, a half-silver Italian, Every day, the market is changing, and the market's businesspeople and nearby small staff love it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, you can make some more snacks and go to the night market to sell until twelve o'clock. Day after day, she can only sleep for five hours a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, I should feed this family." An Mei proudly thought, and then swept away the exhausted feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran was finally desperate, and he was indeed finished, and even the most rudimentary country circuit court did not want him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has calculated that there are no good results for the entire fifty cover letters, which means that the prosecutor, who was also regarded as a promising future, is now Completely abandoned by the judicial community. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, he seems to have just woken up from a drunken dream, only to find that there are many things in the house, and the small, crowded living room is empty. Grandma's kind eyes are also somewhat blaming, and forever warm, bringing a happy little wild cat, it is difficult to see her familiar figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan sat on the steps of the door and touched the dog who was accompanying the owner at the side. At dusk, the bright orange ribbon of the sky gradually became darker. Bleaching and dyeing, and the black silk is gradually getting more and more broken stars, the stars wearing the moon, and the clear white light on the night, he finally waited for someone to wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei is struggling to pull the trailer full of wolf pots toward the house, take a few steps to rest, occasionally raise his head and see Fran, right away I left the car and ran over. "How do you sit here? Receive a reply that you are not hiring you? Don't be sad, there are always people who understand things will appreciate you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up, Fran looked at An Mei, the girl’s round face had already thinned out the chin, the big eyes surrounded by dark circles, dull, slender, lush fingers, cold water and knife wounds. Red and swollen. He stood up and said in a decisive tone, "I don't want to be a prosecutor again, I don't want to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, there is me, what? No problem. You will succeed." An Mei patted the chest and advised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to understand, people who are blocked by the fog of the past, who will not look forward, will always be a failed coward." Fran announced, "Tomorrow I also went to the market, Fran Fryer, even if it is selling lunch, it can be sold more successfully than everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the fee, Tantin, as the king of the capital, is more extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of Byron’s establishment, the original site of Tantin City was an ancient town with only a small wall surrounded by a desert of plains. After conquering the Black Continent, Emperor Como decided to build a new capital with a whimsical decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the mystical school and the church, the emperor dreamed of the gods on the night of the class, and in the vast night sky of the desolate land and the dilapidated city, the stars changed the permanent orbit, and each star radiated the sun. The glory of the day, hanging a huge red cross on the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the coronation that the gods have given me." The Emperor thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the Emperor issued an order to build a new capital, and was personally responsible for the survey and delineation of landmarks. He rode out of the center of the old town, flew in every direction for a long time, and did not cast a whip that determined the new city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The follower seems to have felt the birth of the great thing. He trembled and asked: "How long will you continue to move forward under my majesty?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great replied: "Until the God who leads the way to me stops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all craftsmen and buildings across the country The masters gathered here, but the manpower was not enough, so the army also put down the body and became a worker and a masons. When the emperor died, Tantin built half of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inheriting the throne of the Second World spent half a lifetime, let the city's scale begin to take shape, until the third, the immortal Tantin is extremely brilliant standing on the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, every stone in the city has a history of dignity. On the pavement of any street, the mosaic mosaic painting that has been dismissed by the class may be from the hands of a master who is enshrined in the art palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true of the execution grounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solid wall framed by the cylindrical arch vouchers is curved in a circular manner, allowing the entire execution ground to form an elliptical shape, followed by a layer of spectators The seat makes it look like an open-air theatre. In fact, watching the execution is indeed one of the temptations of the Tantin people. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several death row prisoners were escorted to the middle, and the executioner read the penalty and arranged for everyone, whether it was to enjoy the hammer, the stake or the twister. At the last name, the officials intentionally paused. "Igo Andech, the notorious gangster, smuggler, murderer, has been put on the disc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
