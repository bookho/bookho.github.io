			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Bao Dian Street No. 27 is a private salon-like club. This club is very picky about the requirements of its members. Most of the members are prominent figures in Feidu. In the upper class, it is worthwhile to show off where you can have a place in the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a chic three-storey villa with a wide front garden with gorgeous flowers that are fragrant on a summer evening, with neatly groomed shrubs Cleverly blocking the sight of passers-by, the waiter in a black dress will only enter the person who can show the membership card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is your information familiar?" On a cheap carriage in a remote roadside, Fran asked Lauvita. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I’m familiar with Mr., but I still don’t understand what you want to do.” Lauvita’s face was a little white, she was wearing a pale yellow low-cut dress. Wearing a veil, the style is very trendy, but the fabric is inferior, but at night and when the light is not good, it is difficult to detect how the luxury goods are different from the designer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan’s eyes kept slamming into the chest of Lauvita, which made the girl turn around uncomfortably, and Fran took a big look and continued Say, "You don't have to know that after the event, you will get a thousand Caesars, whether it's the cost of doing a small sale, or you can save it and find a job. It's up to you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near eight o'clock, a light private wagon came across the road. "It’s Duna’s home, the groom I have seen.” Shawei whispered, he was in Duna these two days. The smell of the mansion has been strolling for a long time, recording the characteristics of everyone who comes in and out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Whiteman, remember the way I teach you, and then see your own play." Fran said, "Get off now, Don't be nervous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the girl's background, Kregan licked his lips. "Can this girl do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please believe in your companion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I don't want to be dragged by a woman. If she misses, we will go immediately. Kregan looked at Fran with a bad heart. "You have found a stupid woman who hasn't even killed a chicken, and has not stated it beforehand. The target is the people in the judiciary. So, if there is a situation, leave the fee immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita did not want to be nervous, but her legs still couldn’t help but tremble, and the girl was somewhat aware. She wants to do things, it is not a good thing to be open and honest. It is very likely that she has been involved in a conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the balance of conscience, one end is a law-abiding one, and one end is the pressure of rent and survival. Lauvita thinks, "Turn around and leave, when nothing happened. Maybe you can find a new job tomorrow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of peace and stability can continue." She stopped in the middle of the road. Hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, the stupid girl is afraid to escape." Xiaobis whispered. "She can't. Just match the bread at the fountain. Just wait for the meat ticket." After leaving the club, let's come hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A hard time on the street, when the fees are in the western countryside? Without a quarter of an hour, the patrolman can block it. All the streets nearby.” Fran said, then thought of something, “spray? bread?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You follow me?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, man, prevent it, after all, you haven't said anything to us." Kregan played round. "And if it wasn't for Little Bicester, she stole her wallet. We still have it now. Can't find a candidate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan looked at the gangsters indifferently, no longer speaking, he thought, "This group of scum, and me, It’s a scum that doesn’t deduct it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can use people who are not afraid of doing anything for money, it’s just a trade you want, but His good It is not allowed to force people under the sun plunged into darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauvita suddenly thought of her and her father. In the alley, she smiled helplessly, and she cried helplessly. Her father was lying on the ground with blood on his face. She heard it, the few evils, spent a lot of money to buy a bureaucrat, and cooked and cooked in a hard-working place, like a vacation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She endured the world with silence, self-deceptively believes in the right under the sun, but at this moment, the opportunity for change is coming, she does not want to be silent and patient. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The man is also a nobleman, and the nobles, there is no good thing." Lauvita's body stopped shaking, she closed her eyes, took a deep breath, waited for her again When you open your throat, calm and mean glory is flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall and change are sometimes as simple as that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayre Dunawen let the carriage stop under the roadside road, the career is successful, young and old enough to fill this 30-year-old man A proud look, "I will come out around ten o'clock, you are waiting here," he said to the coachman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, young master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s previous hesitation made her slow. Originally, she had to get Ayr's attention outside the club, but now, the goal has already entered the door, and the guards at the entrance of the club will not let strangers without a membership card enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t want to give up, calculated the distance and angle between the carriage and the gate. After a moment of observation, she combed her hair and walked out from the shadow of the bush. In front of the driver, "Can you take a ride?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the driver’s point of view, this beautiful woman seems to be coming out of the club, he is deep I know that everyone who can be there can't afford to be offended. "But, dear lady, this is a private carriage, your carriage, I didn't see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn old Todton, don't know where to go." The pretty woman complained, "I let him wait at the door, but the old thing doesn't know where to go to drink, I will fire him tomorrow. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really boring to wait for the owner to come back at the door. The driver himself is not only once, slipping away to pass the time, and coming back to the time with the owner’s appointment. . "Compassionate with the peer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually stupid to be lazy was discovered." The coachman thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The kind of small money can sit, and the hot and smelly car will stain clothes." The girl said critically, "Okay, ten Silver coins, you send me to the street to buy some cosmetics, and I will be back soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can get some extra points without wasting your time, the driver thinks, full The face opened with a smile and opened the door, "as you wish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the carriage returned to the front of the club again, and Lauvita deliberately let the car stop. At the main entrance, she walked toward the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss, here is a private club, do you have a membership card?" The guard blocked her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it’s Duna, the baby is letting me come, woman, always take some time to dress up, so he came first, let the carriage go again. Pick me up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching the wagon looking at the street, he recognized that this is the car of Mr. Dunawen’s house, and this woman’s indeed This car is coming down. The club has regulations. Each male member is entitled to a female partner. "Please wait." He went to the driver. "The lady, is the club?" The driver replied strangely, "Of course." At the same time, "I also said that it is a high-level club, even less than half an hour away. People don't remember, this kind of eyesight is fired sooner or later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You please come in." The guard said to Lauvita. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall of the clubhouse is luxurious and luxurious. The floor of the entire hall is covered with gold-lined carpets. The paintings on the walls and the corners are all from the hands of the masters. The ceiling lights of the zenith are dim, and some members are drinking and chatting on the first floor. Some play in the billiard room or the bridge room next door, playing a minimum of one hundred gold smashing a game. If the chat content is too private to be known to outsiders, it will move to the lounge on the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita tried to suppress the thoughts that had never seen a big scene, and pretended to take a glass of juice from the waiter who walked around, she quickly watched Got the goal. Dunawen is in front of the bar table. Talk to another person about which wine is the most tasteful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, our President, I said but you. How many bars do you want to play?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm fine." Ayr smiled. He just got up and heard a pleasant exclamation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, a pretty young lady who had never met, was sulking at him, the drink in her hand, sprinkled a little on the dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., you hit me." The girl’s voice was so delicate, and his eyes were very attractive. Aer suddenly felt . Billiards are not fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The companion knew that his friend was hunting, and snickered and took two shots on Ayr’s back and went to the billiard room alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss, this can't blame me," Ay said innocently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" The girl turned to anger and turned to curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's your beauty that makes me fascinated and makes mistakes, so you are the mastermind, and I am just a poor, humble accomplice." Ayr saw the girl seem to be shy and don't overdo it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita tried to calm the disgusting expression. Continue to be curious, "Do you use words very professional?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It won't be a highly respected judge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe not modest, in fact, I am the person who arranges the work of the judge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I really can’t see you, you are so young, actually "The courtmaster of the president."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am actually the president, can’t talk anymore, or honesty will make you mistakenly show off." Ayr said, then the expression on the girl's face made him cool to the extreme. According to the experience of this hunting expert, there is no such thing as avoiding it, which is more perfect than today's opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They talked for a long time, Ayr let the girl laugh all the time from beginning to end, when he held the girl's delicate softness, did not encounter resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayre, I heard that this lady, who seems to be a rich woman, is secretly taking her father’s membership card and running to the club. He already thought that there would be a fresh prey tonight, maybe it would be pure and innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the watch, twelve o’clock, just prepared to imply to go to the lounge on the third floor, the girl suddenly grabbed her chest, “Hey, my father will kill. My, it’s too late. Moreover, I actually wore dirty clothes until now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will send you back.” Ayr regrets in his heart, his consciousness Can't be anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, my carriage is outside." The girl looked at him reluctantly, then hurriedly walked outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayre wants to catch up, he still doesn’t know who the girl is, and wants to ask for the next date, but the companion just comes back from the billiard room,” Damn, I lost six thousand Caesars, yeah, you didn’t succeed.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
