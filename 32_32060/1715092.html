He said, "I don't want this to happen, but Hepburn is just a person." Ding's thin Marquis family is a holy knight enshrined by Anno. We can't violate it, and we can't even come up with a bit of disrespectful thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother, ask You, save him, he is suffering in the heresy trial!" She heard her mother trying to suppress the crying. "What is wrong with him? Those doctrines, there are also abroad, he just put forward the opinion of approval."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But here is not Byron, not Portuguese, here is the holy Sardinia! It belongs to the Principality of Anno!" The voice was raised, not annoyed, but a A deep helplessness, "I have asked the Governor of Sardinia to be His Royal Highness, but even if he is, he can't say no to the requirements of the Holy City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy See Will burn him! I don't want him to be sent to the firearm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is he? Is it Dad? The one who likes to hold her in a circle and tie her face with a beard, and when she grieves and cries, she is busy with her clown and her laughing father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doesn’t it mean that Dad is out of the office? Matilda is also looking forward to waiting for him to come back and ask for a beautiful little gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wondered, but the nine-year-old child could not think about this complicated adult problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida heard that he had mentioned his name and could not help but raise his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also, Ma Tida. My daughter, I have to be sent to the seminary school to ensure a faithful and pure faith, not to repeat the same mistakes." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, no, they even hope that I will take it away!" Mom seems to be going to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't wake the child." Sighed. "This is the protection of the Hepburn family. It is also the only way to protect Matilda. Anno said he was abyss." The demons are possessed. Otherwise, how can they publish the heretical doctrine? If they refuse, the fanatical cardinals can do something more horrible. They will say that Matilda is also half the blood of the devil and will be her. Also sent to the firearm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mom has been crying. After Martida returned to the room that night, she stumbled into thoughts until she fell asleep again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, a black horse-drawn carriage stopped in front of the house, and the servants sent a box of luggage to the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medida doesn't know where to go. She regrets that she can't take her beloved rag doll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be afraid. Baby." Mom glared at her and kept kissing her face. "You have to remember. I love you, very, very love." You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I come back, can I see my father? Will my mother give me a caramel tart to eat?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I want to eat as much as I can, my baby." Mom smiled softly, but Matida felt very upset. Today's mother seems to be different from the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a face, a pale face to the extreme face. If it is now, Ma Tida can detect it. The face swayed with a look of incomparable death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wheel is over the country road, the air has the fragrance from the nearby orchard, the pomegranate, the grape...Matida is kneeling on the carriage chair, from The rear window gaze at the farther and farther home, and the ivy and small white flowers on the red brick wall are gradually blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matilda seemed to hear a gunshot and screamed in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was suddenly scared and felt lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that day on, she never saw her father and mother again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your name?" The one who spoke was very kind. The old grandfather wearing a glorious crown on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Medida, Matilda Milacas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being the devil The blinded child, there is no such person as Mirakes, you should call Matilda Hepburn in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This works 16k novel network exclusive text version Starting, no reprint without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cockerel sounds from the countryside, awakening the dawn of the mist, the morning breeze blowing, and gradually the white mist. The sky is brighter and brighter, revealing the faint glow of black and blue, purple blue, until the bright blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves of the woods and grasses, rolling slightly at night, form dewdrops, these little water clusters, reflecting the light, crystal clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medida lips trembled, awake from the dream of memories, she looked out the window, at dawn, the day was bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Ai Wei is still asleep, one person occupies more than half of the pillow, Ma Dida looks at her ruddy face and makes it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has lived in this simple little village for more than a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She respects the god, this inconspicuous old man has a divine power that makes people calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With his noble character, he is not an archbishop of Anno's red dress." Matilda thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Holy See was thought of, the girl’s heart was chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, she asked the god, "Hello, what is faith?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pious prayer? Worshiping madness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't afford the name of you, hey, you can call me my grandfather." The old god replied, "Faith is a kind of comfort to the soul, it is a kind of Selfless love, people are suffering, they need care, need comfort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That... Grandpa," Matilda’s voice is very light, "Hate And anger? For example, you have loved a person, a thing, and used it as a whole, but you suddenly discovered that it is not as good as you think, has betrayed you, and has been maliciously opposed to you. What will happen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hate is a kind of evil, it is to taint the dirt in the clear water. But I do not agree with the past, everyone should be free and happy Living, the top of the head should be a blue sky. If there is anything to block the sky that belongs to you, then you have to resist it, but remember that if you knock it down, you should let it go, not slamming it. Tolerance and compassion are not bad things." The old god smiled and glared at the girl. "Don't say it, this is not entirely in line with the doctrine. It is just an old man's experience in a long life. In fact, people should know how to let go, let go of anger, let go of hatred, let go of **. Also put down the burden Suffering."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suffering life continues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 29th, something happened in the Philadelphia metropolitan area, although in the eyes of the big guys, this is only a small regional chaos, but at this time No one knows, it represents the prelude to a conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this afternoon, at the press conference of the patrol hall, several senior officials of the judiciary and editors of more than forty newspapers and magazines were listening attentively. The summary report of the patrol hall named "Gulf Storm". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moderator is Inspector Lyme Cux, he solemnly said. "Ladies and gentlemen. This half-month mopping has perfectly hit the increasingly rampant illegal smuggling in the Golden Horn Bay and has seized nearly a million stolen goods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The commander of the Gulf smuggling. A wanted man who is nicknamed a giant punch, according to the investigation, has died in the gang's inner red. From all kinds of intelligence, We analyzed that the smuggling group has been functionally destroyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sloan’s general patrol sat on the side, with a hint of sneer in his mouth. Although the inspector of Lyme was successful this time, he was inevitably offended. Many high-level gangs have interests, they have decided privately, and soon afterwards, the inspector Lyme kicked out of the judiciary and let him retire early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. Now is the free time for the media to ask questions, and the Secretariat has prepared detailed information, and you can freely ask the staff at the venue for reading." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last row of the press seat, a man with a document on his neck, seems to have inadvertently threw the cigarette butt that had not been extinguished on the ground, and immediately lit up. The carpet, the flame spread quickly, and the smoke was scattered throughout the venue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, please stay calm!" The patrolman at the scene looked for equipment to extinguish the fire. While maintaining order as much as possible, "Please don't panic, have a little problem, and soon can..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two gunshots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The venue was completely confusing, people pushed each other out and wanted to escape from the exit. Smoke and people blocked the sight of the patrolmen. They couldn’t find out for a time, who opened the gun and could not stop the crowd from fleeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire extinguisher spewed out the foam, quickly extinguished the fire, and some people covered their mouths. At the front desk, Inspector Lymecus was painfully poured to the ground, among him. Bounced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black pistol is placed on the chair of the press, and a piece of paper with a red pen is pressed underneath: "The police must pay the price!" When I found out, the contents of the note quickly spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reporters who stood in a safe location witnessed all the events that took place, and they also prepared the title of the front page of tomorrow: "The star of Feidu" , encounter gangster revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage quickly sent the inspector to a nearby hospital, and the reporters followed the past and no one would pay attention to the unfinished press conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night, they got a reassuring message from the doctor’s mouth, "The muzzle is not deep, and it doesn't hit the point, as long as half He can recover smoothly after the month of nursed back to health."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
