The air is floating in the tidal taste, a few cold, inconspicuous drizzle with the wind, maybe there will be a heavy rain coming, maybe with the sun, it will be a dull sunny day. The climate of the early winter is always cold and unpredictable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullan lifted the collar so that he could cover most of his face. He avoided driving an early carriage, in the shadow of the street tree. Walk through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wutong Street, No. 103. Investigated, there are no others, no dogs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He came to a high wall covered with ivy, identified a number of house numbers, and then bent down slightly, his waist and legs force, while jumping, pulling the stems and leaves of the vines, climbing over, for a moment Later, I came to the vestibule of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main entrance is locked, Fran goes to the side of the window sill, sticks the glass window with tape, and the fist with the leather gloves smashes over and the glass is emitted. Subtle sounds, like spider web-like cracks spread. He cleaned the debris, poked his hand and pulled the bolt out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran stood in the black room with the lights on, and heard the sound of water coming. He touched the waist pocket and turned in the direction of the sound. Going, the pace is slightly hesitant, as if entering the ordinary house, but the endless abyss of black charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-counterfeit expert sat by the bathtub with a sleepy eye, and the sound of the water was like a lullaby, let him yawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't visit, please don't be surprised." Fran said, "I came to pick up the goods."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ruben Nigel is obviously shocked. After he sees the person, he stunned his chest and shouted, "How come you come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second window to go left, you need to change the new glass." Fran led the way, "The time is very tight. Sorry."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I have to tell the truth, I hate people in your way, always treating others as cafes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe you need a few guards, or Dogs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hate animals, and do this, can you have outsiders at home?" Ruben groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mold you are done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, my reputation on the road is top After two days, it will never be three days." Ruben closed the faucet and walked out of the bathroom. "You wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran looked at him Back to the back of the building, touched the pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 5 o'clock in the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town of Perast is a noisy place, the nightlife is extremely rich, the middle class will smog the smokehouse, the little ballroom and the soothing The music cafe is a great place to socialize and relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daytime rumors, quickly rushing from one mouth into the other, then the owner of the ear, in order to show their opinions. Refueling will just be heard. As you can see it, you can paint it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the end of the dinner, this sensational case has been heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Perast Police Station is as busy as people can't stop. Investigator Greene looked at the left side of the villa, the broken glass on the second window. He walked over and put his hand into the gap of half an elbow and held the latch on the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspector’s line of sight moved down and picked up a piece of tape with a few pieces of broken glass on it. “The murderer came in.” He wrote this clue. In the notes, I came to the scene of the murder. The bathroom was full of water. Wet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forensic officer just finished the examination, he took off his plastic gloves and said to the inspector who was waiting for the news, "There is a lot of water in the lung cavity, from the back neck. In terms of scars, the victim was attacked from behind, and the murderer’s grip was very large.” The forensic officer turned over the corpse lying on the gray plastic sheet and pointed at the five greenish purple freckles on his neck. This is the strength. It is like a tiger pliers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Specific cause of death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a coma, he fell in the bathtub, and the faucet of the bathtub was releasing water. He was in syncope and was killed by water."探 < br br br 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探 探Halter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold-blooded guy, can't be sure, he just stood by, watching the cold water, gradually drowning the victim's head, pouring the nose into the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you find out the exact time of death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inferred from stiffness, It is about 4 am to 6 am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4:20 am. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the counterfeit expert returned, he handed Fran a small hard-skinned box with a sponge-lined, three-finger clay model lying on his fingertips. It is imprinted with a spiral texture. “Before you use it, wipe it with sweat or grease, so you can leave the fingerprint you are looking for.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulanna A dry finger, carefully watched for a while, his palm is thick and sweaty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Ben opened his mouth and yawned deeply. "I have to sleep well. If there is a next time, I hope I don't break my glass. Otherwise "The expert opened the jacket and showed a small pistol that was not at the waist. "The bullet will make people learn to be polite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think, it should not be next time." "Fran's lips are rising, but the stiff muscles on his face make him a weird smile. He puts his hand into his pocket and holds the handle of the ice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 5 pm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The shell?" The inspector squatted down and picked up a small group of metal in the corner. "Do the residents of the attachment hear the gunshots?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Already asked, no one heard. The wind in the early morning is a little anxious, and the sound is not far away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The inspector noticed that there was a gun in the evidence, and he withdrew from the magazine. "There was a bullet that was fired by the victim. Apparently he did not hit." A police officer shouted, "Hey, what did I find?" There is a dark room!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor bedroom is magnificently decorated, with a dark green marble fireplace inside, and the sofa and the chair are covered with thick The embroidered cushions are hung on the wall of the wall and filled with good wines with various precious labels. It is obvious that the owner loves to enjoy life. After the wall, there is a narrow chamber. There is an iron bucket on the ground. There is a pile of black ash in the bucket. The wall traverses a wire with several pieces of white paper hanging on it. The left hand of the entry has a table, knife, ink, pen, paint... ... a variety of exquisite small instruments, like the exhibition stand of a large stationery store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspector 扒 扒 open the ash in the iron bucket, which is mixed with a large number of purple-black crystals. "Iodine crystal?" He nodded thoughtfully, took off the white paper on the wire, and felt the paper slippery with his fingers. "It is a special paper for making documents."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, this is a studio for counterfeiting. The victim has an identity that is not known to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small safe opened at the table, and the police officers are recording the findings in the cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inspector bent down the body, the safe is divided into three compartments, the upper two compartments are stacked with tens of thousands of cash and some formal business contracts. But the bottom layer is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another clue that the murderer took some of the things in the cabinet. The inspector put these fragmented fragments into a complete map in the brain. The victim participated in an illegal act, or mastered the news that was unfavorable to some people, and was extinguished. Very reasonable to push the Yuan, the inspector went on along the line of thought and characterized the case as a gang gang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4:21 am. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No next time. I think we should never see you again." He looked at Ruben Nigel and was just about to set the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too good. I’ve gotten this. I’m going to stop, if I’m hit by your daughter, you’re going to break through the windows of the gangsters in the middle of the night. Not good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your daughter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course. My baby princess." When she mentioned her daughter, Ruben’s face overflowed with joy and happiness. "Although I only look for it." I want money to travel around, I can't go back a few times a year, but the ticket isn't it just to make her happy?" He stopped his mouth and waved. "Why do I want to talk to outsiders? You still don't leave?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also has a family, and my destruction is not a person’s life, but a family’s happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The determination to kill is like a sea tide. On the shoal, the sand was piled up like a castle, and after a few minutes of collapse, Fran stood on the dark corner of the street, frowning, revealing an unpleasant irritability. The heavy darkness is like putting a gloomy coat on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man is an unbelievable creature, especially in the face of greed. Fran does not trust the counterfeiting expert to keep secrets forever unless he becomes the bone under the grave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought bitterly, "It’s really weak. I once let go of Paris, and the result almost made Barry and the troupe’s friends in danger, thanks to that. The woman is as childish as her plan; she didn’t kill the drow with Zolfa Ronchi, but let Lauvita almost die. Oh, what I have done before, the stupid justice and compassionate pity, let Do I bring danger to my friends and companions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face is twisted, his body is shaking, his forehead bursts with blue-violet blood vessels, and his throat is low. The hoarse roar, the inner world is fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe in justice, there is always good and good news, and the cause and effect of evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you believe, why do you want revenge? Just wait, waiting for the trial that is going to be in the foreseeable future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to be infected with crazy endless blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have been contaminated for a long time, a drop of dirty water mixed with water, and a piece of dirty, is it qualitatively different? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just don't want to break into hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are already in hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am already in hell." He murmured, turned back and walked toward the place where he left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evening 5:27 pm<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A detective sneaked over and said, "We have A strange discovery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roof of the attic has broken a large hole and looked up to see the sunset afterglow. The floor has a thin layer of dust that shows a row of shoe prints that extend into the hallway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two intrusion points? It's really weird."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More strangely, the house The outer wall was covered with slippery moss, but we didn't find any traces of climbing, and, "The agent pointed at a scorched black residue scattered on the floor. "In addition to these, no tiles were found. Wood, where are the destroyed building materials?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5:03 am<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; When Fran crossed the wall again, he heard a gunshot from the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped and observed the surrounding environment, the sound of the wind moving through the corners of the street, the weak insects in the bushes, except for the gunshots. Still a dawn of death and gloom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, what's in the room?" Fran squinted and took out the gun, and the vines on the wall hid his figure. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than five minutes, the villa door opened and a man walked slowly to the vestibule. The man was about one meter tall and eight feet tall, his shoulders were wide, his head was in the cloak, and he flipped his fingers. "Law: Explore humanoids."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran The magic pendant of the chest defense detection spell is slightly shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No witnesses." The man nodded with satisfaction, crossed a cross in the void, and then quickly and quickly jumped over the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two days ago, I met this person at the Nigel Exchange." Fran came out from the hidden place and secretly said, "You can use God." Surgery, is a holy warrior? It is not rare for Byron to have a holy warrior. The Knights of Anno will stay near the city of Tantin, but why, the holy warrior of the Holy See will appear in the government of a forgery expert?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of Matida, Fran is sensitive to Anno. Got up and find out? He pondered for a moment and gave up on this plan. There is a more direct way than tracking a mighty samurai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bathroom, he saw Ruben Nazher lying face down in the bathtub overflowing with water. Fran put the gun back in his pocket and subconsciously took out Ruben. The man was comatose, but there was a weak pulse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squeezing the chest and draining the water from the lungs, there is a 40% chance of saving him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan stunned his hand and let Ruben’s head be replanted back into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He searched for the other person’s clothes for a while, didn’t find what he was looking for, and went upstairs. In the owner's bedroom, Fran found the darkroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabinet door of the safe is open, and the key that is being searched is inserted in the keyhole, but in addition to the money and common instruments, there is no interest in Fran. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The holy warrior took away the affairs he had entrusted and killed him." Fran thought without any irony, "the so-called glory and sacred apostles, and me." Isn't that the same person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just got ready to leave, stopped again, and reached for the key. The experience of fraud, let Fran understand the model of various locks, the lock core of the safe is known for its complicated structure, and the key to open it, the teeth are also very numerous, on the chain, there are two keys for the safe. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no safe in other rooms, then the other should be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc. When Fran walked out of the villa, he felt a bit of chill. He couldn't help but look back, the dark room was a real tomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest in peace, I can only say so hypocritically." Fran, "Just is not stupid, pity is not funny, but these are not me. This kind of small sinner can master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inspector who obtained the search warrant at 6:00 pm, led the man to the art transaction belonging to the deceased Row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
