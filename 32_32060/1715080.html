			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The outline of the shadow of the tree is like a free ghost in the night, the loyal subordinate of the giant boxing, the small Bies, the fourteen fine-handed gunmen who accompany the wave Trimming, he used the sly moonlight to look through the road map from the inside again with the sinister little eyes under the sparse eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal is to hide in a private villa in the suburbs, without any knowledge of what is about to happen. There are only a few people in the whole house, rushing in with the darkness to solve It is not difficult to get rid of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he witnessed it, the crow has a supernatural healing power, but what kind of use can it be used under the gun? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After tonight, Golden Bay’s gang headquarters, which has access to nearly a million Caesar’s smuggling channels each year, and the promising large-value bond of Lauvita’s investment All of them will belong to Kregan, and he will be the real second hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be prepared, there are still a few miles away, the location is very remote, so I am not afraid that the gunshots will cause trouble and be clean and degraded." Said, the gun body of the pistol wiped a smear in the lower part of the jacket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tick drop and..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sitting clock in the hall makes a dull sound , smashed the lonely dark space. Fran Flair was sitting in the darkness, he was a little restless, and his chest was empty. It’s awful to be alone in the middle of the night, but what’s worse is that he’s coming up in a mess and it’s hard to explain his thoughts in words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tick drop and..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 12:40 midnight, he is drinking a cup In the cold liquid, seems to be wine, or coffee, or tea? He didn't have time to think about what he was drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to do something, read a book? Going a few laps outside the house? Still screaming a few times? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he does not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trips and..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt that the sound of the clock was a harsh noise As if it brought an unknown shadow, he clenched the cup and slammed it toward the bell, slamming. The smashed glass and the cracked porcelain pieces were scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there are footsteps in the corridor outside the door, then the door is ringing, and then, gently breathing, Fran is not listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, you...should have a nap." Lauvita said worriedly that she had never seen Folan so embarrassed, in her mind in. The head always faces everything with a silent mouth, a rational mind, and a calmness beyond ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl started to meet with Fran, and she noticed a bit of weirdness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Fran ordered all the people and tried to find the trace of the Shadow King Assassin, she thought that the King of Shadows was the biggest enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The samurai also has to be wary. If she returns to the church, we cannot face an interest group consisting of Anno, Gorse and Dragon's Secret Association. "She suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, don't worry about anything else, just find all the clues of Ann...Caulion. She is still not in the south. What? Hide the location, leave a trace, and find me for her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although somewhat biased. But Lauvita trusts the wisdom of her head, and she thinks that Fran has arranged otherwise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now, she finally found out that it completely contained a frantic madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman who killed herself almost twice, Long Yao’s high-end killer, Ann Corleone, seems to have a deeper relationship with the head, not A simple enemy on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and her, is there a past that is unknown? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita is afraid of her own imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse outside the hilly wooden house has been buried to the ground, and Lauvita Whitemane silently watched the earth bag protruding from the ground. The dead inside is her subordinate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Resident, I will avenge you." The girl prayed silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limestone mountain encounter, together with this, almost killed the elite gunmen who were loyal to her in the gang. "It’s all the damn woman." Lauvita clenched her fist. The nails fell into the flesh of the palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hoof of the hooves stunned the birds in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl converges on the look of grief on her face, she knows, the reinforcements are here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Whitemane, I brought a team of people to come overnight, what can I do if I can help." Shawei smiled and grinned. Look at it from the eyes of others. The face of this big man can be extremely accounted for, and the cheek on the right side has a deep-colored knife, which is the medal he left in the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the eyes of Lauvita, this five big three thick, only the man who speaks with his fist is trustworthy, compared to the hidden knife in the smile, the false guy who is full of righteousness, knows the grace The newspaper's mix is ​​more trustworthy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, speaking, you are now a big man." Lauvita answered with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawei touched the shaved hair. "I am a gang, does the site belong to Mr. Kregan and Mr. Crow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita shrugged, and although the man was grateful to the head, he remained loyal to the giant boxing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We must find the traces of two people..." Lauvita is not ready to ask for boring, she wants to pull Shawei completely, she is preparing to explain the ins and outs. There was a groan from the camp and a bang on the pistol. "Who?" asked Shawei's subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Laugha?" is a low-pitched voice that the girl is very familiar with. She ran around in a small run, "put down the gun, the head is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Fryer's figure gradually emerged from the shadow of the woods. "Lord Crow, my benefactor, it's great to see you again." Shawei went forward and held Fran's left hand, respectful. The ground touched the back of his hand with his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walked gently to Fran's side, "Head, sorry, I have done the task you entrusted."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have done a good job." Fran looked at the girl's cheeky cheeks. "Although not perfect, but in the world, how perfect is it?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl looked at Fran, and a sweet smile swayed in her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There may be some people who are not enough to search across the map." Fran said, "I need information from all hospitals and private doctors within 50 miles. Did they receive the people we were looking for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good idea, she is very hurt, and she is likely to go to a hospital with pharmacy and treatment equipment. In this way, the scope is much less.” Lauvita agrees. “But it is also necessary to pay attention to churches and monasteries. The samurai is likely to be<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Fran interrupted her words. "Now I am not busy looking for Ma Dida, I just need to find Ann Coleon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly walked over, kneeling beside Fran, stretched out Shooting, stroking his face, Fran's look of disregard, made her feel bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me stay alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If someone is with me, I think it should It will be better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please leave me alone." He repeated the words again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl answered with silence. She slowly stood up. Holding Fran's head, her imagination made her fearful, so that she forgot that she should follow the steps and slowly let her head leave her plan. She only wants to be more intimate with Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand slammed her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big brother, you are beautiful." Cecilia like a kitten, turned around Fran, and later, simply jumped on his knee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't say that a man is beautiful, you should say handsome." Lauvita showed a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran stroking the head of the orc girl. Twist the pair of hairy little ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little girl, I forgot to bring you a snack, I will make it up next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At the time of Tantin. Every time Fran sees Cecilia, the little girl is wrapped around to buy something delicious, so that he can develop the habit of buying a box of cakes in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know my name?" The orc girl held her head with her hand, and Fran was not allowed to continue. She was very strange, this is very long. Beautiful big brother, touch his own hands and movements, very much like Uncle Quasimodo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the taste is also very similar. Cecilia smoked her nose and wondered. But the appearance of two people can't overlap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forget that I have changed my body, and I don’t know my current appearance." Fran took a moment and slowly retracted his hand. He did not explain much. Turning head to Lauvita, said, "What clues have been found?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still some shortage of personnel, and it is being ruled out in a hospital. The result is estimated to be In recent days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautetta continues. "There are still things, Kregan has a change, the gang headquarters in the Golden Horn Bay, a large number of armed personnel suddenly left in the majority of weeks ago, the number of people surpassed the number of smuggling boats in the past, I don't think it will be Kregan Got a big deal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a person who is not worthy of trust, I have been wary." Fran said, "Between me and him. The covenant is very fragile. If he wants to swear, then I don't have to follow it any more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, what should the gunmen do? In the mouth of the traitor, they can be sure that their target is us. Shouldn’t let the man who sent the investigation clue back, the defense of the stronghold is not enough to deal with an attack.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smells the smell of wine in her mouth, the lips explore her, a sweet vertigo surrounds her, she is warm Responding to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if it is a substitute, I am willing." Lauvita's sexy lips slowly turned into a faint smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels that she is having a fever, the whole body is constantly shaking, and there is a kind of blurred iridescent light in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She screamed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawei pushed in the door, "Lord Crow, there is news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw three A body that has no blood, has lost its life, this is a forest that has been fighting, about a town of about thirty-five miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deceased is called Medivh, the doctor who opened the clinic in the local area, is also a good old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole family of three, tragic death at home, there is a knife wound that cuts the trachea between the throats, the wounds are rolled and fleshy, and a layer of strange black purple is applied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until yesterday evening, the neighbors have seen the doctor for a long time without opening the door, so they reported their doubts to the police station in the town. The police broke into the house and found that This is a tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran bought the coroner of the police station and entered the morgue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a kind of good-natured middle-aged couple, and their children who are still underage, are being wrapped in cold brown plastic bags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was pale and his hands were shaking, as if he had thought of the most terrible thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia looked closely, then looked up and said calmly, "It was the stinky woman who did it. I smelled her dragon-specific smell. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran knows that his wife has been brainwashed and brainwashed, and has powerful powers. It is impossible to do nothing to kill, but he wishfully thinks . It was not her intention, it was coerced, and the deceased were the perpetrators of dogs and dogs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality made him almost unacceptable, and the innocent man died under his wife's knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is using his own methods to punish his despicable enemies for his experience, but his wife, like those who hate, also destroys a family. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then. Who will give revenge to those who are innocent and dead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is unable to suffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited for the opening of the gates of hell, but his wife, the good woman who had been kind, had already taken him one step and became a dark and cruel part of hell. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put her on the couch, but his mind is getting clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always thought that men should face everything calmly, the so-called woman’s body is the best way for men to vent their sorrows, he disdains Gu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he thinks it is. And it is very correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran felt that he was despicable. He and Lauvita are indeed very close, but his feelings for her have not yet crossed the line. He is using a body temperature of a woman who does not love to comfort himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what I volunteered, not what you are responsible for. We all have needs, and we need everything." The girl whispered, she noticed The man is slow in movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at her nephew, the gray scorpion, no grievances, only the joy of warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be responsible." For a long time, he was softly promised in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita finally got what she wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia is standing with his tail. Sneak out from the crack in the door. The subtle voice in the hall could not be heard by others, but I couldn’t help the orc girl who was supernormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brother and sister, what are you doing? Fighting? My sister’s voice is so strange, and it’s like being disobedient and being punished, it’s like If you are full, you are satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought about it for a long time with her head, still couldn't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adults always love to do something inexplicable." Finally, Cecilia nodded. She yawned and prepared to go back to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If my sister blames me in bed in the morning, I will say that the sound of your fights woke me up." Little girl found the reason for sleeping late. Yang Yang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stables outside the villa, tied with seven or eight unloaded horses, "more than expected, but we are suddenly attacking, and the target is probably I am sleeping." Little Bies thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lurks in the shadows outside the hedge, observing the movements around him. At this time, two and a half men in the house were wearing jackets and yawning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s time to change the shift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, wait for the day to rest, let’s How many drinks do you want to go to the city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Bies vaguely heard them talking, and could not help but pay, "Lowvita and crow are not stupid, know that At any time, we must step up our defenses. Fortunately, we came suddenly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his hand, and the gang’s armed men wrapped around in all directions, ready to turn this into a bloody battlefield. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshots are everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We were attacked by the gangsters!" A man was shot in the leg and his companion dragged him into the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of the number of people, let the small Bies put them in the main house, the guards of the crows by the protection of the solid wood wall, keep on the door And hit the gap in the half-open window. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Little Bies considered the point of pushing the fire out, a gunman rushed over and handed him a blood-stained coat," We seem to be on the go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the attack, the injured man lost his clothes in the yard, light gray, triangular collar, and a shiny silver-platinum badge on the chest of the front, which is very popular for smugglers who deal with the police all the year round. Familiar with it is the suit uniform of the Byron Road Cavalry Patrol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Biss didn’t have time to think about why the crow’s secret stronghold would become a transit stop for the patrol. He heard the hooves and the whistles. Screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two cavalry detachments that had just finished the patrol and returned to work with their peers arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They began to charge toward unidentified assailants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southern Highway Mounted Police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very sorry." The Chief of Police apologized to Lauvita, "The lease of your business is given to this Council, the villa that serves as a transit supply station. It’s a slap in the face of a gangster’s attack. Of course, all the repair costs are paid by this Council.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byron is known for having a perfect road, cavalry patrol The team is responsible for managing law and order and various accidents on the road, so every few dozens of miles, there will be a simple supply station to facilitate the rider to change horses and rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Feidu family is called the Purple Raven Business Bank, and is preparing to expand its business to the investment company in the south. A few days ago, generously at a very low price, A suburban villa built on the main road section, rented to the patrol police headquarters as a supply station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The riders are very comfortable with the warm stone masonry and wide compared to the other facilities that are simple in decor and facilities. Rest room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are gangsters who dare to attack the police publicly, and the South is much more chaotic than the fees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lauvita is a surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Respected lady, I swear in the name of the patrol headquarters, this is just an accident, you must not mistake the southern chaos." The Secretary replied that he Loudly promised, "Please feel free to invest in the South, and don't cancel the lease, so there will be no next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
