			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. The sun gradually fell behind the hills, and the wet wind from the sky over the ocean, the last touch of orange faint, also blown away, There are only two colors left in the whole sacred, dark purple blue, gray and white dull clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be heavy rain, so experienced travellers have stepped up their pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hilly land, near the sea-facing road leading to the town of Mazian, there is a raised hill, a pine forest growing on the hill, because When constructing the road, the local materials were taken from the hills, and a large amount of crushed sandstone was mined from the hills. The side of the mountain near the road was almost flattened, causing passengers on the road to open the window and look into the past. Under the green grass composition, there is a large piece of muddy yellow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "To the Guest" is located at the foot of the mountain. From the outside, this is an ugly building, a long bread pattern, two floors. The roof is a dark brown shed. The door is very large. It can accommodate a carriage directly, indicating that its predecessor was a warehouse for loading goods. It was simply trimmed and turned into a passenger shop. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is not a roadside full of withered wildflowers, a winding path, and a faded red lacquered wood sign guides the tired passengers, passers-by It is hard to find that in the wild, there is a lonely travel stack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the travel stack used to be a small businessman, but he was never able to adapt to the intrigues of the mall. The heart was not enough, not enough black, and worked hard for decades, except for the circle. The verbal praise of "that guy is a good faith person" has only accumulated a small savings. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that he has to work on his own, and he is not sure that he will have nothing to lose, and he is ready to invest in a stable industry and spend the rest of his life safely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After examining a number of projects, he took a fancy to this warehouse belonging to a nearby small shipyard. The house was full of materials and was built firmly. In the middle of the town, half a day ahead is the town of Mazian. It will take a long time to arrive in Songrui Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you spend some money on decorating, you can change to a coaching inn. If you miss the trip, you will be willing to spend some money to enjoy the warm room in order to avoid the wilderness. And hot water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small shipyard is preparing to move, so the price is very low, so he uses most of the property. I wished to purchase an industry that could support the latter half of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first few years, the business was good, although it was not close to the gold, but it was also good for food and clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before two years ago, the continuous construction of the Bay Road was finally extended to here, and the travellers only need to drive four hours to get to the town. Merchant trucks are also more convenient to travel between cities, they are satisfied with the increasingly sound transportation network. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but for the owner of the brigade. This is undoubtedly a disaster. "Damn the road! My clients are getting less and less." He often squats in the doorway after counting the income and expenses, like an enemy. Looking to the smooth national road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This month he lost more than 700 pieces and was forced to fire the chef and the only waiter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eldest son participated in the army and wrote a letter back recently, saying that he was appreciated by the big man and had the opportunity to advance. Two other beautiful and intelligent children were studying in the town. The old wives are also taking care of them. The old shopkeepers and the old travellers are generally left alone in the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We said that he is a good faith person. I am also proud that I have never been fooled, but today, under the pressure of the situation, honest people are forced to do things that are not honest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of tricks that hurt people's self-interest, such as deliberately at night, pour a bucket of oil on the road, black night wind, pull the car The horse accidentally licked the hoof, or the wheel slipped to make the bearing malfunction. The person in the car can only come to visit the business for a night, so that he can delay the schedule of sliding to the bankruptcy abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I break the production, they will have no money to study, and the tuition is expensive. Although the eldest son can support the family, it will affect his future." When the sun sank into the mountains, finally decided, s. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carried the leftover oil in the kitchen full of barrels, ghosts and ghosts stayed on the road, squatting and passing, throwing them out And took the hoe and took some small pits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not tired, but he is sweaty, sprinting back to the inn, closing the door and panting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after a few hours, maybe the oil is not slippery enough, maybe the pit is not deep enough, and there is no guest at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, what have I done? If I have turned over the car and have a big accident, my conscience will not be peaceful." In disappointment Yu, he was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenery outside the window is turned into a vague shadow at night, about 10 o'clock in the evening, the boss gave himself a hot meal, is preparing to eat early When I fell asleep and went out of my dreams, I heard an eager knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, he was shocked by a cold sweat, and his mind flew through countless thoughts. He had a road patrolman and found his own scandals to catch people. ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you go to jail, my meager reputation is completely ruined. No, I have to argue that the oil is sprinkled by a horse in the past, small The pit may be a quality problem of cement, and it’s not a matter of my own confusion. The boss opened the door with uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, there was a small accident on the road, the axle broke, it is estimated that it can not support the arrival of the destination." Some people said, "Only you are a family, Excuse me, is there any extra wheel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people, one is a middle-aged man wearing gold glasses, and the other is a pretty lady with short hair, girl Holding a younger girl in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Hey, I am here on the brigade, not a repair shop." The boss replied with guilty conscience. "No, it is better, you have a rest here, tomorrow morning." Take a ride to the town to buy, cars and horses, I will take care of it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Traveling?" The middle-aged man looked up and looked at the interior furnishings. There was a glimpse of the flash in the eyelids. "It’s no wonder that the car is on the way, but it’s an accident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say? The boss stammered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Wendun, the suspicion of no reason, is not a virtue worth boasting." The pretty lady who has been silent, suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this world has eroded me too much, I only see evil but I don’t know the beauty. If you don’t keep guiding, I will be lost. Blindly." The man, known as Mr. Wendun, said loudly, at the same time, yelling at the boss. "Please forgive me for offending. Ok, let's stay for one night and do what you said. · Pretty lady smiles with approval, obviously The man’s words are happy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait. · Little girl shouted." It seems to be very deserted. If you make a discount, we will stay. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good...well. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, two rooms, I am sleeping with my sister tonight. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss secretly wiped the sweat, the former career of a businessman, let him have some experience, but he is not allowed to identify the identity of this pedestrian.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the habits. The middle-aged man should be the elder and the person in charge on the road, but from the point of view, he is like a two-woman servant.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the other party is obviously not like the bad guys. After a few days of empty room, the guest finally greets the guests.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind rolls through the window roots, Sending Hui Cui's slight noise, Xiaotoutou yawned and looked out. "It seems to be raining, and it is very cold at night." The fireplace should be burning. Otherwise I will not be charged. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are honest in the travel stack boss, we can know that because of this huge rain, and his fascinating activities, it happened soon. Some things, he must have regretted it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rain the rain, knocking on the roof, making a rhythmic sound, after the guests have enjoyed the meal, stayed On the second floor of the room, the hall was quiet, the boss packed up the table, and dragged a bundle of firewood. In the big fireplace, fished with a stick to make the flame more vigorous.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He stayed until 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, it is estimated that there should be no more people to stay, ready to lock the door, go to sleep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a voice that made him erect his ears.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a knock on the door, and a group of late arrivals arrived.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contacted Peggy and asked her to "inspect" the location of an unmanned hilly land twenty miles from Mazian Town.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byron’s Crown Prince. Reluctant to choose the trading venue in the town, she is more urgent than the kidnappers to avoid the eyeliner of the various forces, so I readily agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan left the gray-eyed girl on the Black King, letting the orc Loli first, using her supernatural ability to ensure that the other party did not Hide the ambush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia is more lazy, like a pet cat, eating and sleeping all day, may be tired at sea, in recent times In the day, she often climbed to the top of the mast and blew the sea breeze to sing an unknown orc song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that a song? I think it is a random call." Lauvita was woken up in the middle of the night, strangely asked, "What crazy hair?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children are like this, nowhere to vent their energy, they like to find something inexplicable." Fran explained irresponsibly. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃, whether it is an adult human man and a Gothic woman in adulthood, or Cecilia, who lacks family guidance in childhood, is not aware of the physiological common sense of the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the orcs who live a little shorter than humans, the age of fourteen is already the age of Lolita's transition to the royal sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia is about to face the first estrus in life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the ship docked at a semi-natural secret pier, Fran led three gunmen and boarded the prepared carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are Julius in the same trade, but Chu Jun is caught in a heavy sleep, placed in a coffin with a vent in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to place the coffin, the carriage had to use the convertible type, so when the rain fell, they encountered a lot of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temporary support of the shed can not hold the wind and the wind, and the ground that is soaked in water is difficult to move forward like mud, and is set in the hills The base of the place There is still a considerable distance from the abandoned forest lodge somewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a difficult half-hour advance, they saw the rain, revealing a faint yellow light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
