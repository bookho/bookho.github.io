The description of the language, I can't imagine what it is.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the experiment is done, please let me know."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Fran looked at the watch. "I have to go. It is estimated that I will study for a few days. During this time, it seems that I can't participate in any banquet or horse race." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who are talking about the content of the ceremony, strangely seeing the protagonist hurried away. "What happened?" they asked each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our new count is really busy." Viscount Kate, who got the first-hand news, said loudly that he was going to show off the two that he had just learned. New noun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just getting on the carriage, Fran leaned on the chair and was too tired to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry, everything is up to me," William said. "I just witnessed the occurrence of this symptom in order to find out the reason for it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please, please." Fran's eyelids were as heavy as iron, and soon he fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fei Yi Li Lisi wore a dark cloak and walked through the gallery of a private salon. At this time, the entire salon was empty, quiet, only her The heel, the crisp slamming sound on the hardwood floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls on both sides are covered with oil paintings of masters of all ages. These artistic treasures that have caught their eye have not delayed her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walked along the promenade to the last room on the left hand side, at the end, she stopped in front of the door of a room, a waiter dressed up, to her Nodded, whispered, "Ms. Li Lisi, the master is inside." The commander of the Paladin walked into the door, respectfully and deeply, "His Highness. Good Day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to be vain." The man was half-squatting, holding a magnifying glass and carefully watching the paintings lying on the table. She replied without lifting her head. "If you don't mind, you can call me directly." Miss Ji."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, my Highness." Li Lisi took another sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peji still pays attention to the painting, after three minutes. She threw away the magnifying glass in her hand and shook her blond hair. She said boringly. "The painting with visual impact is just a piece of stain under the magnifying glass. I have never learned to enjoy the art." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is Mr. Michelle's "Wilderness". It is indeed a miracle in visual art, and this painting is his transformation. The painting begins. The master gives up the carvings of too much detail. Let the picture become wild, which can make people feel shocked from the soul. The rendering of the paint, bold layout. Full of master genius everywhere. "Sparks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought that the paladin of Anno was a group of simple and serious Puritans." Peggy smiled softly. "No. I think that you have in-depth research on painting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I don't know how to paint. The comments I just made were only seen in a book of this review class. "Less," said Lieutenant, "You are told by the presiding officer of the Cathedral of Tantin. I am here. Don't tell anyone, I don't know what's going on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Lilith, you are the head of the Sorrowful Cross How many years have you been in the position?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Fei Yi Li Lisi does not understand why the Byron’s lieutenant will mention this, out of courtesy, she Truthly, "five years, from the age of fourteen. I was assigned to the Knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the tradition of Anno, the head of the post It must be a beautiful young girl, and it can only be replaced when she is twenty." Peggy said, "This is a private interest. At the latest, next year, after you leave the Knights, the Holy See will What's the arrangement?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, your hobby is really special." Li Lisi's tone was mixed with some dissatisfaction. "As usual, I will go to somewhere." The monastery serves as the nun, or stays in the Holy City as a deacon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the auxiliary priest, that is only one step away from the official bishop. Maybe in the future, you will become a female archbishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For me Belief is always in the first place, and the level of position is no different for devout believers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggie said sorry, "Hey, I Rude, the secular people always use secular ideas to measure the minds of believers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You told me so mysteriously, just to ask My private affairs?" Li Lisi was very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not." Chu said, she turned and sat in a chair and said, "I just want to know why Anno sent a sorrowful cross. To Byron?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your words are strange, the Knights are to escort Lord Roland to host your wedding.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this regard, I deeply feel the care of the church, so I pay special attention to the Knights." She knocked on the ridge of the chair. "When you entered the country, there were a total of 680. Two people, but I was surprised to find that there are only 568 people left. The seven knights may have a family in Tantin, so that they are reunited at home and they have lost their sights?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The lord of the Duke of Leinschmann, is it private, does not trust Anno's friendship with Byron?" Li Lisi's forehead, slightly sweaty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to bury the real purpose, along the way, the Knights used to send the scorpion of the command of the Holy City, sent several detachments, went to church institutions everywhere, no one It will be noted that when the teams returned, they were few and the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The father is not aware of this," Peggy said. "And, just because I want to strengthen the friendship between the church and Byron, I will ask You come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused for a while and continued, "I recently learned a very bizarre thing from a certain channel." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what will surprise you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Eternal Cabinet." Ji said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
