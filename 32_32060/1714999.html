			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. "The Cardinals?" Zallfa Ronchi asked, he just heard the word from Matida. I used to ask, the girl thought about it and thought about it, and then said logically, "My father and I lived in the big red bird."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well, I remembered." The girl waved her hand. "The people of the Cardinals are all good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be a famous big theater company. "Zolf thought, he looked at the letter of the desk, it was a notice of delisting, because he had not reported back to the Western Dark Police Hall for too long, he was fired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I heard which city the Cardinals are currently in and sent you back." Zall Law said that he took the letter and returned to himself. The bedroom, the door is tightly locked. At this time, the secret policeman trembled palely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of paranoia, he himself ruined his future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I have no retreat now. It’s all you hurt." The secret police murmured, then smiled. "Don't die, crow." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of a rumor, the Mamolke fleet that was going to return to China was slowed down. In the rumor, a large number of the finest smuggled wools were seized at the fee and the authorities were prepared to auction them at a cheap price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone who hears this news keeps the secret and then orders the ship to park in the port first, but the wind is still spreading rapidly among the Mamouk merchants. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is actually such a thing, but the businessmen who are so excited to go to the official auction house are disappointed, the quality of the wool is not so good, and the price is not rumored. Cheap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least three days of delay, the replenishment of the ship, the cost of the sailor, all the money." They asked the captains to go to the various bar small hotels to call the sailors Come back and blame each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swaying branches are looming in the night, a small manor in the suburbs of Hyde is silent, but in the darkness, you can see vaguely, many people in each The key sections are hidden. This is the main stronghold of the Kregan gang, and one of the industries he forcibly accepted Igo Andech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window of the three-story house in the middle. Still with the lights on, the new owners of the manor are discussing how to find the old master and remove him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The wool is only a second-class product, but it is worth 100,000 Caesar. You pay for this money."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan said, "And we also lost a few boats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compared with the harvest. Deliberately smuggled goods The patrolman found it, nothing.” Fran said, “Don't you want Andher to escape? Will you come back to trouble later?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The pair is half open "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan turned over a large stack of sent-in information, looking for clues from inside, he said without raising his head, "30%."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, happy cooperation." Krigan said with a smile, making a friendly concession, and then thinking in his heart, "When this is done. It is time to break up." A gang does not need two chiefs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooperation? Fran is also thinking, "Kregan has a firm foothold. I don't want to share the benefits with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sooner or later he will leave this gang, but now not the right time yet. You must have certain control over the gang to get intelligence channels and manpower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His enemy, not to mention Igo Andech alone, and more powerful than Andre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Happy cooperation." Fran shrugged his shoulders with the same friendly mask as Kregan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am waiting for your message, and I will leave immediately if I have a clue." Kregan left the room with his men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are hundreds of horses in the Golden Horn Bay. Except for those who have just entered the port and are buying goods, they only count the goods they are ready to leave. There are also nearly one hundred ships. Fran people have reasons to explore the Eastern continent. Every ship was sent to ask for the deposit of all the guests of the ship. Andech could not pretend to be a sailor. Hey, a person with a pocket full of tickets, but would rather squeeze in the six-person sailor’s room, would immediately cause the whole ship. Human suspicion, only by boarding the VIP cabin to board the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, if the captain replied, "Yes. But some of the VIP cabins have already been occupied, not all." That boat is worthy of attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deposit also cost nearly 60,000 Caesar, and the news of the feedback narrowed the target to more than 20 ships, but scattered in various ports of the Gulf. He could not go to the search one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To race against time." Fran took a forehead with a headache. The enemy is in front of him, but he is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lauvita walked into the room. "One is called Moor, and a letter is placed in the purple crow's mailbox. He may know Ann. Dexia’s whereabouts.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran remembers the sailor who once helped, and asked him to return to friendship afterwards, mentioning Igo Andech The characteristics of the appearance, let him find within the limits of his ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this sailor is rare, and he is very grateful to the kindness. He even dismissed his work, kept on the port, and relied on his own relationship. Secretly inquired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Igo Andech escaped the enemy's tracking, but did not pay attention to an ordinary little person who was idle in the eyes of others. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, Moore saw a crow looking for someone on a cargo ship in the port to Queens Island, although the other party had a simple make-up, But he still inferred from several indelible features. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens Island is the Marmolk fleet that passes through the endless ocean, returning to the last ship of the Golden Bay, returning to the sea boat of Mamuk, also Will stay there for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The beast is usually the most vigilant when he flees." Fran said, "I made a big mistake. He didn't board the boat directly in Golden Bay. Instead, go to the middle of the transit port to transfer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He should still be at Queens Island, not leaving so soon."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notify Kregan, bring people together, get ready for the big ship and supply, I will chase the black king first." Fran stood up, put on the coat, took out the small from the drawer Pistol, check the gunpowder and the clip, and put it in the pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
