The reverberation of the gun echoed in the depths of the hunting cemetery, and large groups of crows roaming the branches flew from the treetops. , making a hoarse and screaming tweet. Near the evening, dense foliage obscures the light of the setting sun, leaving the woodland full of ghostly charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy Don Leinschmann will be high-profiled with blond hair, wearing a blue-purple suit, from the right shoulder to the waist The black belt is tightly tied, and the trousers are tied in the long boots. She is stepping on the soil covered with a layer of soft pine leaves, holding a handful of mouth and braving the faint white smoke. Tube shotgun. The big dog "monkey" shook his tail and ran forward cheerfully, returning from time to time to patrol the owner's position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not really a good hunter, at least the gunfare is a mess." Peggy looked at the traces of a moose run on the ground, lazy With a slap in the face, regardless of politics or conspiracy, Missy can use her sly wisdom to cope with it, but after all, people can't be perfect. She has always maintained considerable weakness in various aristocratic sports such as riding, waiting for hunting and fencing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big dog sniffed and sniffed in the shrubs of the deer, suddenly raised his head in confusion, the wet nose slammed a few times, screaming at the air stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, please be optimistic about your dog, lest the guards be brought in." Anno's holy warrior ritual Fei Yi Li Lisi came out of the shadows. Even as a role as a detective, she still wears a dignified light-colored top, and the button buckles into the collar, which is stereotyped and meticulous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are still outside and inside, and it takes fifteen minutes to arrive at the fastest." Peggy passed the clothes and licked her waist. The assassin The wound left is always a pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Lisi gently walked over, like a obedient maid, half-baked on the side of Missy, and put the palm of her hand in the position of her waist. "Law: First-class treatment." The weak white light penetrates into the fabric, and a warm feeling gently strokes the scar and dispels the pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic is indeed wonderful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thanks to the prize. Previously when you were in distress, The Holy See was helpless, and His Majesty the Pope had always felt apologetic," Li Lisi replied. The magical technique has finally fallen in the field of healing. Anor's most famous masters can also perform up to three levels of treatment, and they have long been unable to cope with serious injuries to life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although there is no way for me to fully recover immediately, but it can be an analgesic, it is not bad." Peggy said with a smile. But the tone is calm, "Is the man of Anno, decided to cooperate with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope respects and trusts your piety, God treats it well All the people," Li Lisi said. "As long as you can get back the holy things, the Holy See is willing to support you in all matters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it sounds like Very good. But I received the news that Bishop Roland’s actions in the near future were very different.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t understand what you mean.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy touched the big dog's furry head, his eyes smashed into a line, revealing a kind of smile. "It seems that the intelligence work of the Holy See is very efficient. I have already learned the location of the Eternal Cabinet and are ready to do it myself. Then how can I believe in the promise of the Holy City?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Li Lisi was silent for a moment, "Anno’s instructions to me are to express friendship to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that I only chose the church. Retreat, and you can't participate in the core tasks. They don't believe me, and they don't trust you either."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The believer will not choose because of heaven. And hesitantly shakes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the rest of the life, rotten in a closed monastery, is heaven's kindness to you? You are the seminary A graduate with a good grade should have a better future." Peggy was pleased to see each other's eyes flashing a sway. She knew that Li Lisi was not as old-fashioned as she was on the surface, and that this woman had a fire-like **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But... I can't choose." Li Lisi felt that her mouth was too dry to speak, and the undeniable pain climbed into her eyes, the girl remembered The life of the seminary, because of a mixed-race hybrid called Matilda Hepburn, she fell from the clouds to the vulgar mortal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy See does not value a last saint who can only endorse, barely be able to perform a level of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is aware of her future, becoming a convent of the region’s elders, almost the end of her seat in the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need the support of the Holy See. You look forward to getting approval and attention." Peggy tempted that it is imperative to persuade the Holy Warrior to cooperate with her plan, "as a diplomat, as an envoy of Ann Arbor in Byron, to be able to display Your talent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Lisi took a deep breath and then screamed, she stared at Peggy's eyes for a long time, as if to see through the soul of the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anno is too self-righteous, the Holy See must be clear, without my assistance, they can't get what they want. Others ask me, ask me for others, The difference is like a hundred divides."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you also covet the power of the Eternal Cabinet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I have no interest in those broken pieces, and don't say that there is a chance to recover, even if the complete sacred object is placed in front of it, it is nothing.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is eternal life. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life is too long, and fun is limited. When you feel uninteresting in everything, eternal life is a desperate cage, I don't intend to experience it." Humiliation and suffering in being caged. She whispered to the samurai, "working with me can bring everything you desire." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Li Lisi trembled. "You let a pious woman fall." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the difference between man and monkey. We enjoy the sweetness of hell, and we must also wear the brilliance of heaven." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less than five minutes after the samurai disappeared into the lush forest, the royal attendants holding the torches saw the Prince’s thoughtfully through the trees. The gaps gaze at the fragmented, dim sky.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, are you not feeling well? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, just a little tired." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The team of His Royal Highness has come to the Hunter Estate. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, getting married is really a hassle." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work 16k novel network exclusive text version of the first release, without permission can not be reproduced, excerpts, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Jassavin walked on the tree-lined path. At the end of the road, he saw a towering white partition wall with a sharp electrified wire mesh at the top. . Building a tower at the corner of the wall, guarding the serious guards. It is an isolated area, surrounded by uninhabited smoke, surrounded by shrubs and pine trees. Along the way, the professor did not finish ten times, and saw a huge warning sign on the roadside, which was written in bright red: "Private land, idlers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The entire area is carefully protected. Only one road is adjacent to it. There are guard posts on the road. Only those holding invitations and special passes can continue on the road. Every ten minutes, a cavalry patrol patrols the road, and the closer to the core area, the more rigorous the alert is, showing that visitors from unrelated people are not welcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After ten miles from here, there is a cavalry battalion. If there is any change, they will arrive at the scene in a quarter of an hour." Professor Jassay "The large-scale troops are dispatched, but the Byron authorities, the sorrowful sects are not working. They can only be used as bait to attract sneak peeks. I have to figure out the guard information here to determine the number of special detachments."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three guards wearing gray leather jackets, holding the hounds and hiding their weapons at the waist came over. "Are you Professor Lobby, or Dr. Xinnu? Please Presenting the certificate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I have heard of their names, all of whom are high-ranking peers." Jassavin took out certificates and invitations from his jacket pocket. If there is nothing to answer, "it seems that there is a big discovery, otherwise the elites in the whole industry will not come together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Jasavan? A guard swept a few documents and turned to walk inside the partition wall. It seemed that he was going to check the information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The perfection of the certificate is flawless, and the invitation is a genuine original. The true Professor Jasper is far away from Ingmar. No one has seen him here. "The true appearance." He thought, "even if I was discovered, as a master of the dark hall, the samurai master, I can retire in the three guards who rely on the firearms. The guards who went to check the information quickly turned. When he came back, he said slightly, "Professor, please come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
