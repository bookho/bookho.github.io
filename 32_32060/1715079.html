			<div id="content">Jules is very exhausted, this honeymoon trip has almost exhausted all his energy, endless entertainment, his wife’s coldness, night’s Lonely and occasional nightmares made him feel dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every celebrity gentleman who is eligible to attend the royal banquet is eager to communicate with the great emperor of the future for a few minutes, as a mayor, laughing and laughing After Julings toasted with the cup, then the members of the city council must try to come together and show that his relationship with Julius is equally intimate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of tolerance and weakness makes it difficult for His Royal Highness to refuse anyone, especially when others smile. He smiled and drank a cup and a cup, and with the name of the Sir Alex or the bureaucrat, talking about trivial and boring things, after every glamorous banquet, his stomach would be uncomfortable for several days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness is kind and compassionate, and very kind to everyone." People said with amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The man who doesn't know how to refuse is really funny. Even if it is a carriage in the station, it will be used to reduce wear and tear. He ridiculed that there was a cup of tea that was soaked back to him, which made Julius warm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Peggy just didn’t want to hear There was an unpleasant vomiting sound in the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to draw people's hearts, you can understand, but I didn't see it, you have this intention." The ghost also said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghost? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did meet a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not unusual, in many records or legends, many immortal great men have had similar experiences. For example, the great poet Danku, who once claimed to have met the ghost of the mentor, took him through the endless abyss, so that he wrote an amazing poetry; and as the ancestor of Julius, the founder of Byron Como I was taken out of the account because he was awakened by the soul in his dreams. I saw the miracles that mysterious scholars have been talking about so far, so they built Wang Duanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julius touched the strange bluestone brought out by the institute with his fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, he only felt confused and lost, he couldn’t remember at all, why did he take everyone and put it in his pocket, and This ghost seems to be only with him. Communicate through pure consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But gradually, curiosity overwhelmed the unknown fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They discussed the Renaissance of oil painting and explored the origins of classical music. Whether it is history, humanities or customs of the world, or theology, they have left their shadows. . Julius is immersed in this wonderful atmosphere of learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius began to admire the ghost. It was very knowledgeable, and he knew everything, even the king of the king who thought he was involved in art. They can also argue with each other at the beginning. But in the end, he only listened with humility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way for others to know their conversation, so that Peggy always sees her little husband. Sitting on the sofa, smiling, but my eyes were blank and dazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about this guy?" Missy occasionally thought, but there are more things to watch, she will soon be Julius’s strange manners. Throwed behind the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what exactly do you exist?" Julius did not know how many times he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My child, not yet in time, with a secret treasure box, always have to open at the right moment." Soul mysteriously answered him sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the shadow of doubts is still unwilling to leave. But this is because human beings are a mysterious things, instinctively awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ghosts that are in the record of the sacred and majestic Anno sacred things, will not be the devil who lures people into hell." Julius So guessing, "Maybe it is guarding the eternal cabinet for centuries, very lonely and good guardian spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Royal Highness is very happy to comfort a lonely heart Get an invisible friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, Julius also vomits bitterness to the ghosts, those who are troubled by the fact that he can’t find someone to talk about, but live in the stone. It is a very good talk object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I really don't know how to come to the wife's favor, flowers, praise, unparalleled gems, I can give her anything, just to see a spark of love in her beautiful eyes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You talked to me about her story, it's an unusual girl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"So it is worth my love."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a strong woman, and you, but you have gone the wrong way, there is no right medicine." Ghost Analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wrong way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To conquer the heart of a strong woman, you must look More powerful than her, let her respect your wisdom and admire your judgment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Day, I must say with dismay, in literature and art, Peggy falls Far from me, but in other fields, such as her passion for law and politics, I have no experience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, try to understand you The wife is thinking about something and bringing me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius has hesitated to agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pace is lying on the bed in the bedroom and looking at a professional book about the interpretation of the law. The brilliant blonde is scattered on the white shoulders, curvy. The body was wrapped in a thin silk nightdress, and she heard a knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s me, Julius." said the person outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course you, is there a second man here?" Peggy put down the book, a little impatient, "Come in."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty of the bed on the half bed, the striking white skin at the neckline, makes Julius a bit awkward, seems to notice his temporary loss, Peggy frowned Pulling the collar up, he said, "Can't help it? If you come hard, my strength can't resist the forced request of a man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius is very bland, don't know where to open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you will be defeated by one sentence, I have made a weak friend!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the ghost shouted in his consciousness "It's like a lion and a warrior on the Colosseum. Which side is weak, and if you want to avoid your eyes, it means failure and death. You do what I say...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"A husband, trying to understand his wife, this is not a mistake. Julius took a deep breath and suppressed the panic inside. He sat down at the bed and said sincerely, "I think you have been upset recently." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see it? Peggy thinks that her husband's manners are so slightly different from those of ordinary days.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, if you can, please tell me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy doesn't think he can have any good ideas to help himself, and replied casually. "My few brothers who don't come together on weekdays, make up a few days ago." When they get together, God knows what they want to seek? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius is slightly squinting as if he is thinking thoughtfully.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Waiting for the answer of the ghost in the stone, for a long time, slowly said, "Do you let them feel the threat? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Missy opened her eyes in surprise, although Julius was not a fool. But this is totally inconsistent with his previous mode of thinking. Just like Joan VIII. As evaluated, his eyes will only see the light, but will not be able to detect the darkness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you think so? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The interior of the gorse family is not harmonious. Many people know that, in fact, there is no such a wealthy family that can maintain no cruel competition. A harmonious atmosphere. Julius replied, "According to the law of nature, when one is strong, the other is weak." Will gather together. Fight together. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And a suspicion of alliances, there is no value in existence, they are looking forward to others to be the first bird. If you encounter obstacles, you can immediately get out. And, you won't be hurt. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What is the reason for this decision?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s very simple, you don’t need to think, because you are my wife.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of prestige and confident tone is definitely not a regular Julius, can be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He took the wrong medicine?" Peggy put the spine on his chin and shook his head strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When leaving Peggy’s bedroom, Julius was ecstatic, "Day. Have you seen it? Peggy’s attitude towards me today is totally different! We can communicate for almost half an hour without any obstacles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"My child, don't be too excited, she just has a little curiosity because of your sudden change, and it is far from true love."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With your help, I will always unravel the cold shell that she refused to take thousands of miles away. Touching her heart." His Royal Highness Prince Chu said heartily, "You must have some impressive achievements. For example... well, preside over the implementation of a large bill, or the operation of important policies.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I think, with your help, I am full at the moment. "Confidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, I am not omnipotent." The ghost said modestly, "I have been sleeping with the holy things for thousands of years. I don't understand the changes and rules of contemporary politics. And I understand a lot of things, but I don't want to do it. The dark side of politics, no matter which generation, will exist, and they make me uncomfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement is in line with Julius's conjecture: an ancient, good, well-informed soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the eternal cabinet, on it Research can not only save your father's sick body, but I also enjoy it. It can make the great creation of the gods reappear in the world." The ghost shouted, "And the whole world, who knows better than me? What about it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am hosting the Royal Academy?" Julius felt that the proposal was good. He happily thanked him. "It is my luck to have this special friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucky? The ghost thinks, if it can have a human body, then its present expression will be full of ridicule and eagerness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much to match the wavelength of its soul, and to receive its awareness of communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was thought that he would be trapped in the stone-like demon props forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, it sees a glimmer of resurrection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t worry, let him trust me more, step by step into the trap." The ghost thought evilly, "The Fallen An exclusive text version starts, Reprinted without permission, extract, more recent and fastest chapters, please visit!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medida Hepburn puts the whole body in a heavy cloak, pace Traveling idly on the street. She doesn't know where she should go.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man passing by in a hurry, hit the girl's shoulder and hit her a slap趄.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, are you a little girl with no eyes?" Rubbed my clothes. The man looked at the dirty stains on the cloak in disgust. He couldn't help but slap on the sleeves and just hit the place, while he was squatting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Samurai girl no Expression, until the man is not funny, and he will continue to move after he has been unlucky to leave.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have at least the goal of life, but what about me? What is the meaning of my life? She whispered to herself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The familiar bells fluttered over the building, at dusk, just at the beginning of the night mass.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stopped and raised her head and stared at the end of the street, the church with the holy spire on the top.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The old monk of a church shook the bell and walked over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He handed a leaflet to the church to Ma Dida. "If you want, you can come to the mass. Every church member is our brother. Heaven loves the world and will not be biased by the identity, appearance and color of the believer.

How can I eliminate the hatred of my heart?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She does not know how long it ran, the flow of people and buildings around More and more rare, she ran out of the town and came to the wilderness in the suburbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is all caused by the heresy of the Feidu sewer. If it weren't for him, I am still bathed in the glory of heaven. Not him, I will I don't have to remember the memories that made me fall into the endless abyss.” Matilda shrank the whole body and covered her face with hands, like a little helpless deer. “Maybe, kill him, I can go back to the past. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s eyes brightened and she seemed to find a reason to continue living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Anzo Patriarch, the elders of the Pope, is carrying a fragrant cigar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Healache, trying to find someone in Byron is really not a simple job." Although he complained in his mouth, his expression was very relaxed. "I I don't know, I can't beat Matilda myself. I have been missing for three years, and I don't know if the imprisonment has been solved. If she remembers her experience, then I have to be dirty. The killer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This world can't easily make people happy for a few days."
