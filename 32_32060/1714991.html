			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Agatha Luda avoided the servants, slipped out of the side door of the house, just rained, and the bleak plants on both sides of the porch seemed to have recovered. Point the spirit, the raindrops left on the leaves slowly caged into larger water masses, and fell into the soil along the yellow veins of the leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a mature woman in her thirties, but the time is obviously very kind to her, and she has not portrayed wrinkles on her face, her eyebrows are still Feminine and young as a girl, every time I smile, the right side of the face will reveal a shallow dimple, so that the middle-aged woman still retains a bit of innocent taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw a figure standing under the lamppost not far from the back alley, "Is it Qianning brother?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agatha shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good girl, you can figure it out, it’s innocent." Qian Ning complained, and immediately anxiously asked, "What about money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The children just fell asleep, I was convenient." Agatha explained that when she mentioned the child, her face was full of happiness, the eldest son was just thirteen, but acted The manner is already a small adult. The younger brother is two years old. He is always spoiled, sweetly glaring at his mother, letting him eat more candy, and not afraid of long fangs. The two little things, she has been looking forward to their growing up, and occasionally embarrassed, preferring to slow down, so that they can spend more than a few years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brother, you still go to work, and Connie has already introduced you to several jobs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Agatha took out the small purse from the bag. "It’s not the way to go on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chen Ning started and took the wallet," My brother-in-law looked down on me, remembering the hatred of the year, what kind of work, all the errands, no matter what, I also had a good time, how can I do that kind of thing." He said, turned and left, just took a few steps, it seems I felt that I should comfort my sister a few words, so I stopped. Laughing and said, "I will pay off my gambling debts. After the rest of the money is turned over, I will never gamble again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agatha sighed, My brother said this, but the promise has never been fulfilled. His father’s family was corrupted by him in less than ten years. The husband also helped at first, but since he learned that he used the excuse of “opening a shop, investing in a factory” to get the money, he immediately sent it to the table and never gave up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big Brother said in front of many people, "The kind of cockroach, Luda's family can't be defeated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Money can't give him anymore, that can only Let your brother get deeper and deeper, let him go to work, I will open a few letters of introduction." Conris told his wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Agatha knows his brother’s character. Nothing to be a senior manager. Also do not want to do the low-level small workers. But others can leave him alone, big brother can leave him alone, and the husband can leave him alone. I can't look at my own brother who is hungry and suffering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was close to Qian Ning’s second brother, and her flesh and blood relationship could not be measured by a few dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, don't frown, smile, you are very cute when you smile." Qian Ning patted her sister's head like a child," When I was young, I was behind me. Qian Ning’s brother kept calling like a follower. Once I was naughty, Dad shut me down in the dark room and was not allowed to have dinner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or you get up in the middle of the night, from the kitchen..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let's go, Connie is coming back." Agatha stopped Qian Ning continued to talk and watched him walk out of the alley. She gently closed the side door and walked through the back garden. There were a few thunders in the sky, and it seemed that the rain was going to go down again. The cloud of the gloom of the sky is rolling, as if the sky has been lowered a few points. The plants in the garden trembled in the cold, and Agatha looked at the sky, thinking that his brother had mentioned his father, and his face became pale and helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few decades ago, it was a rainy day, and it was also a thunder, which was too similar to today’s scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She keeps a secret and vows not to mention it, not to think back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"secret?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone has a secret, and some conceal something that is not good for him. Some don't want to be shared by others, and some want to protect some people," Fran said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, then, what secrets do you have?" Lauvita put her body close to a few inches, under the light, the girl's eyes are blurred, the delicate lips With a sweet smell, the chest of the clothes is pulled low, and most of the white chest makes the man think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now is not the time to talk about this place." Fran said impatiently, "Why in the middle of the night, will you appear in my room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Woman, Occasionally there is a demand." Lauvita twitched her nose playfully, and the palm of her hand was gently covered in the scorpion of Fran, the heat of the palm, as if through the pants, let something wake up excitedly from sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franla opened her hand, "Go back to your room, there is still a lot to do tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, but this little guy, that's not the case." Lauvita's mouth was swayed toward the ups and downs of the crotch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to worry, really split, I will arrange your future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lauvita straightens up, and the charm in her eyes is calm and calm. "I can’t really be you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan knows the girl’s mind, in the gang, Cray The roots are a group of three. As a head and a planner, he is a gang. The girl must find a close alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The button belt of this gang is the benefit. When they come together because of their interests, they will also be separated because of their interests. The use of wisdom and temperament to make others convinced and loyal to death will only happen in fantasy novels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe they can continue to work together for a long time, maybe tomorrow will part ways, who knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, a few years ago, she was a kind girl." Fran thought sadly, he always recognized that the Goethe woman was The party in his first lawsuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lauetta came out, he suddenly said, "In fact, you think about it, only guess it is half." Then close the door. In the dark corridor of the hotel, Lauvita leaned against the wall for a long time. She remembered the person she had admired, the one who treated her gently in court and sought justice for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody knows that he has secretly followed him, trying to find out all the news about him, watching him fly in the distance and falling to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man has a decent career, has a wife who loves him, and himself, is a demeanor, poor Goethe girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sold the lunch, and the stalls in the market were tense. When she saw that the man was falling, his wife, dragging a small cart to the market to find the open space, she quietly let out her booth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, she still had the illusion that the person was no longer a prosecutor with a high status. She might accept herself, but she did not want to destroy the benefactor. family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the news came, tearing up all the dreams of dreams and shyness. She thought she would never fall in love with a man. But now there is another person, a person who leads himself into the thrilling world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the way of thinking, the subconscious little gesture, the tone of speech, she actually saw the shadow of the prosecutor. He is not him, but he is very similar to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, Lauvita’s face suddenly burned up, and she was ashamed of her demeanor. “This is a person who is fraudulent, how can I Connect him to the noble benefactor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, Fran couldn’t sleep, he was still thinking about the life of the mayor, perfect without Oh, like a rare saint. But it is so perfect that he feels unreal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost bankrupt...The father-in-law died...The inheritance made him climb again..." Fran thought, the mayor of the mayor, is it dead? Is it too time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he looked at the hour and was about to sleep, he found his little guy, still hard and straight, "damn **." Fran reluctantly Thinking, as a normal man, he has not touched a woman for too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullan took off his jacket and prepared to take a cold shower in the bathroom to keep his mind and body calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always appreciated dnd’s setting about bloody battles. The two poles of the world are not light and shadow, justice and evil, but order and chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is currently shifting from a firm, lawful and good camp to a chaotic goodness, and does not rule out continuing to fall into chaos and evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
