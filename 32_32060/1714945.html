			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan’s heart is full of gloomy anger, and the Master’s failure again and again makes him hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sewer, the idea of ​​freedom and living temporarily suppressed anger. Now, he is safe, and he is free from danger under the protection of the Master, but he tries his best to make it. The chaos of the mood began to be active at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hate, this human original sin makes Fran’s chest burn with flames. He can’t sleep at night, and occasionally he can close his eyes and dream of all the good things in the world. The things, the expectation of happiness, are torn and smashed under the big hands covering the heavens and the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he was sweating, shouting the name of the enemy, awakening from the nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes can’t stand it, Fran rushed outside the tower and frantically hit the rocks on the island with his body, making himself bruises and the power of the sacred objects in the body. Healed the wound, and immediately, he began to hate himself and hate why he should survive, why should he continue to bear this injustice. He cursed everything around him, the blue waves under the blue sky, the flying seabirds, even the comfortable wind, will inexplicably make this poor man crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discharge and self-abuse is also a means of relieving pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William always looked at him with pity, sighed, hoping that the mood of the young man would slowly stabilize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing that can comfort Fran, only know from the mouth of the Master, the scene of the murder, did not find the body of An Mei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the little wild cat is still alive, and Fran uses this most precious message to paralyze his own nerves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first discovered that hatred would make people so distorted. More than once, Fran wanted to abandon the help of the Master and quietly dive back to the city to find a way to go. The Imperial City, with a powerful hand to kill a arrogant woman, and then use the world's most cruel poisonous punishment, dispose of the gang leader, wash the unforgettable hatred with countless blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, hell is what this world should look like, the dark clouds of sulphur, the unfathomable sea of ​​sorrows, the sinister temples of the devils, can not accommodate the world." The measurement is dirty." Fran thought, his face full of anger, making his face more horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the inscription of the just saint Mutu, the solemn affidavit of the court, and the little conscience of the human heart saved him, preventing the devil from being a believer in the mortal world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to me?" He said, "If you become the most disdainful person, you will be able to abandon all the morals of the wicked in order to vent your anger. Nafran Fryer, what he has pursued and believes in, which is regarded as the most immortal truth between heaven and earth, is not a joke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He advised himself to be calm and not to be a sinner who would only murder and destroy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran again began silently silently, sitting quietly on the third floor, looking at the busy experiment of the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharmaceuticals and magic have no effect, only the traces of the sutures on the body can be lightened, so that the eyes are no longer red and stunned, and the two arms are barely pulled. The same size, he just dressed from the shape of the hell evil spirits into a ugly deformity of the body, called ordinary people feel disgusted rather than afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Master tried his best, and finally the flash of light flashed from the skills of Druid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is possible to form a beast from man, it is not difficult to reverse the adult from the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage got the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is ready to create a ring with his collection of magical materials and decades of experience in alchemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the sun and the moon alternated thirty times, the highest masterpiece was born in the Master's alchemy career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ring is very light, hinged by three spiral wires, touched by hand, the whole surface is a little bit numb, and the hole is uneven, if you can enlarge the ring Ten times, it can be clearly seen that the spots that are unrecognizable to the naked eye are all complex patterns of engraving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, from a purely secular perspective, this is not a gold or silver, even a ring of gemstones and diamonds are not inlaid, so the only people can wear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master was very embarrassed, his eyes were deeply trapped, and the thin figure seemed to be a few more flesh. He wiped his sweat and said to Fran. "For the first time, I tried to combine the three legal arrays into a more powerful large-scale array. You should try it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ring was tightly worn on Fran's index finger, and the inside was protruding with tiny tines. Fran felt a sharp pain in his fingers, as if thousands of ants eating meat, swallowed the flesh and sucked the bone marrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was black in front of his eyes, shaking a few times, barely falling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, a feeling of connection with the flesh of the ring comes to mind, as if it were like a nail, it is part of the finger and the living thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are a mage, you don't have to be so troublesome, you can manipulate it with magic." The wizard said, "Connecting with the body can make ordinary people rely on their minds." It can be used. The drawback is that every time you take it off or put it back on it, it will cause pain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan touches the ring with a ring, "Can it make me recover?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Transformation, it can make you look like a human!" the Master shouted. "Of course, it can't change the appearance at will, the magic that can achieve that effect." The ring can only be created by a legendary alchemist. You must paint an image in your mind and let the ring remember.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to choose carefully, chance only once Handsome young people, old old people, and even beautiful Americans, the looks and body you choose can't be changed anymore.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, please Forgive me for my low mana, this ring can only be changed for 72 hours, and then it can be supplemented by the automatic operation of the array. The whole process takes 7 days, that is, every other week, you can use it once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, the Master’s face is a little flush, he thinks, this Limiting a lot of rings is really not useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Fran said sincerely, "In the face of this selfless friendship and love, I am only grateful."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of image to choose, it will obviously not be suitable for the original appearance, it will make the enemy immediately alert when they see themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary ordinary people? Or the old man who is not wary? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan thought, until the one who saw it in the waterway, the perfect body of the Son of God came to mind, "It is indeed very boring to deliberately beautify yourself." Child, but I have to admit that sometimes it’s helpful to be handsome and to do something.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
