The poet intoxicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chemical and physiological reactions caused by hormones and brain gland secretions...The doctor calmly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A miraculous blessing book is reprinted to pick up the land k literature network...the lonely person prays to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is vain... The pessimist whispered bleakly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that in the most essential nature, there is only a fanatic **, that is the inheritance of the barbaric ancestors, and the desire is far stronger than love. It is also easier to cool and forget, but morality, responsibility and possessiveness, as well as more subtle feelings, have joined forces to create a kind of yeast that contains good and pure media, like fermenting bacteria that make water and rice into wine. Animal ** sublimation is social love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, less gossip, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to watch the show tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight, we will witness a horrible love, they hate each other, hate and love, but attract each other, they are even gods It is also the horror of the shackles that transcends the limitations of life and death. At the last moment and the next moment, they will still fight indifference until they are bruised and bruised, but at this moment, they are caught in the vast ocean, indulging in their own Unbelievable pursuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Casimodo Burr, the aristocratic adventurer of Ingmar, a legal expert, my savior, perhaps," when seeing the face of a man When he was in shape, Peggy was extremely calm, and all the brain cells were running at high speed, calculating various possibilities. "Still Frye Flyer, the miserable monkey of Fei, the poor prosecutor of dereliction of duty, was put A fool who is blinded by a childish vision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Peggy von Como, Byron's most graceful royal prince, is colder than the blood of reptiles The woman, the ambitious politician," said the other party in the same tone. "It's still Peggy Don Leinschman, the evil woman who betrayed her husband, the wanted fugitive, and the drowning dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words have already answered the question, Missy's face is almost white, and the pale green blood vessels are clearly visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Eternal Cabinet?" She stunned her head. "The date the Holy See was discovered was very close to the time he was murdered."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a nightmare. Let me continue to face this fallen world, and it is a sweet dream, so that I can taste the fruits of revenge and sweetness."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are still the same, childish." The person in Peggy’s discourse said that he changed from "he" to "you", and she has already overlapped the big man in front of him with the barely tall man of the past. It’s up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran looked at her eyes. "The reason why this world has fallen into such a sad situation is that in every corner building, you are covered with this self." Pests that can be punished without punishment. Laugh at the law and despise justice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. But turning around and thinking, you have done a lot of bad things, at least I Can you decide. Julius's soft egg is kidnapped, it is your secret plan." Peggy laughed. "This is your philosophy. Want to retaliate, can only become the same person as me?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head with pity and contempt, "ridiculous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...you said It’s right.” François sighed silently in the shadow of the night that penetrated into the room, turning and preparing to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is enough, for a woman like Peggy, to continue to live, forever in the rest of her life, the endless body of thoughts frustrated. It is a more unacceptable punishment than death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, the monkeys began to feel soft and soft." The sudden anger over the reason, Peggy sneered in desperately. "Don't you do anything, torture me." Kill me and do what I have done to you and your family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you still confess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never regret it." Peggy pointed, and she strode over. Blocking the road, raising his head, staring at Fran, then, smiled slightly, picked up his feet, reached out, wrapped around his neck, and the hot body was put into the man's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran subconsciously wanted to set the entanglement of this woman, but an incomprehensible emotion made his muscles stiff as a piece of pig iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this only left? You are a daughter-in-law." He almost roared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful face of Peggy is blurred in the darkness. "I just make your revenge more complete, poor monkey." She clumsily across the pants I'm groping for the roots of **. "You are still alive, it's good." Her voice trembled like a flower in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dean of the St.Grand Institute led a large group of civilian bureaucrats, who were so eager to kneel in front of them, anxiously looking forward to His Royal Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is getting thicker and thicker, and the dean is a little confused. Why is it that the escaped prince does not return to the king immediately, but stays at this place overnight and the news is blocked. Gathered a group of research institutes of lonely scientists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is still proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In just one year, I met my Highness twice!" The Dean thought with pride, which undoubtedly represented a bright future for his future. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the notice a little earlier, he hurriedly took care of all the affairs and tried to be perfect, hoping to give Chu Jun a wonderful impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't say that I can reprint the identity of the Luk Literature Network in the scholar's book and become the director of the Royal Interior Bureau." He was excited to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal mission is expected to arrive at the destination two o'clock in the morning, Julius half-eyes, the bumpy carriage makes the sleepy sweep, but how he Also can't sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you still thinking about that vicious woman?" The ghost condemned, "Get up, she may be fooling around with other men at the moment! You are about to A miracle has become an unparalleled existence in the world, and there is an opportunity for her to repent and pray for forgiveness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am thinking about our encounter." The Crown Prince replied in his mind, "Everyone has turned away from me. Only the elf who is also a teacher and a friend is waiting patiently. If possible, I really want to seal you." For the Duke, you can listen to the guidance and advice at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke? Immediately I am the quasi-emperor! The ghost laughs silently, and it has a way to let the Eternal Cabinet play the last bit of energy, transform the body, make people immortal, and at the same time, let it change the consciousness of the experimental object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With only a little time, it will be able to return to the world with unparalleled status. As for Julius's unlucky one? Will replace it forever in the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I start the holy things according to my method, you must cooperate properly and have no resistance." Ghostly, "otherwise, it will not succeed." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius stared blankly at the night scene that hurried past the window, without answering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am about to change, maybe this change will come early. You will not betray me." He whispered, "Now, what are you doing?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, arrived." The leading guards rode back on horses, slowed down in front of the window, turned, and shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince sticks out his head and studies the gray-white buildings. Appear in the field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I finally say goodbye, I am pitifully ‘friends’.” Rio Angus’s dead soul thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Finally say goodbye, my friend." Julius thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啪", Peggy slaps him in the face, nails poked into the flesh, draws deep scars, her eyes are floating in the room The fire in the darkness is filled with mad anger and wet **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rides on the man's body, the muscles of the bare thighs are tight, and a wet hair covers the forehead. Excited flushes spread over soft skin. Like pouring white paint on white paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, this monkey, is it so good? Is it good? You have done the wife of someone else and went to the king of Byron. I know that the brains of the male monkeys are all such things." The lapels of his shirt, his forehead against his forehead, looking directly at him with the same eyes of anger and anger, panting and shouting loudly, pink tongue and small white teeth appeared in the corner of the lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啪", Fran returned to the girl's slap, let her teeth smash the lips and seep bleeding. He turned hard and put the woman back on the ground. The sweat continued to flow along his cheeks, and he was accumulating and then dripping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crazy scorpion, vicious snake." He replied, "You ruin everything in me, I ruined you, it's all you." The means of teaching me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lady writhed wildly under him. The elastic waist is like the strength that can never be used. "I should be on it." She screamed and protested, and sneered. "It’s very fast. Hey, the monkey will only imitate human beings, you will die again. Ten times, 10 times of resurrection, it’s just a monkey.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dilapidated floor creaked under the tumbling of two tumbling **, initially dusty But soon, the sweat from the wet tower was mixed into a muddy mud, and the white-gray wood wall shook slightly in a rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The double feeling brought by stinging and pleasure finally made Peggy’s nephew linger, the sensory world plunged into chaos, she bent her waist and raised her hips upwards From the throat, the silk is low, and it takes a long time to bite the teeth. "Don't be too proud, Fran Fryer, don't think I was conquered by you. Don't think that Peggy likes monkeys, don't misunderstand. The old lady lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have lost, Peggy Don Leinschman," Fran's fingers caught the girl's shoulder, he looked She, "You are a poor pity of failure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pei Ji held his body with his elbow, his nose tipped against his chin, "Speak straight, don't Cover up oneself, that humble and careful thought." Her eyebrows with a charming smile, and a proud sense of victory, "You like me, long ago surrendered to my toe, love and hate, only across A thin piece of paper is actually one thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Self-deception can only hide you from the bleak reality and win an illusory By "Otto replied," Poor slut "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;They insulted each other, and each other was filled with resentful resentment and came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius is looking around the hall, and there are countless thousands of indoors equipped with machines that condense the essence of science: large steam engines with cables, freezers... slow Slowly focus the line of sight on the brownish yellow rot in the glass cover, "open the hood." He ordered the followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, there is no imperial order signed by the Emperor and the House of Internal Affairs, I cannot..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Dean only wants to stop, Julius gaze at him faintly, his eyes cold and ruthless, the poor dean trembled, overwhelmed by the majesty of this royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, let the hose run through your pulse, maybe it hurts, don't worry, I won't lie to you." The ghost is too excited to make it," By the way, to drive out the insignificant people first, this secret is best only you and I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, this is not a secret." Julie Shrs shrugged and walked to a giant instrument in the distance, fiddling with the valve, a huge pipe running, the pipe leading to the outside, Chu Jun bowed his head, the mouth rumbling and the whistling wind, let his hair They are all floating in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be far from it, Your Highness." The dean hurriedly said, "This is an air compressor, sucked in, even the tin can be pressed into thin Iron sheet, we only open it when we do individual experiments, we have to be responsible for it, it is very dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to try the effect. Julius smiled. He walked back and lifted the ceramic tray with the wreckage of the sacred object and walked toward the conveyor belt step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dean shouted with a cry, "Please don't... I will be sent to the prison by the Internal Affairs Bureau!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost screams in disbelief. "You...what are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't say it, let Fran Frye Are you resurrected?" Julius's face was full of blood. "This disgusting thing should not exist in the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I lie to you," the ghost is almost pleading. "But it really makes people get immortal life, think about yourself, think about your father, yes, he definitely needs the power of the holy things. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People will always die." Julius came to the conveyor belt and released his hand with an unspeakable expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a minute, there was a huge roar at the end of the pipe, and numerous white spots of light escaped, and then disappeared in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mixed! You ruined my last resurrection!" The ghost is going crazy, it curses and threatens desperately, "I will kill you sooner or later." I even want to let the entire Byron be buried!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chu Jun still smiles, smiles and warmth, "Final truth? My friend. Out of friendship, I can let you choose. If you remember correctly, there are incinerators and acid pools in the affiliated laboratory of the institute. Which one do you like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The fear swallowed the mind of Rio Angus, and he whispered to himself, "Where is it wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't make a mistake The acting is really good. Even before the moment, I still hesitate. Should I trust you completely?” Julius said softly. “But at the moment when Peggy shot at my chest, I swear, No longer believe in anyone, especially the gift of not asking for a return."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the lime ceiling at the top of the hall, laughing happily, Was so intense that his eyes out with tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many years, the title of Lord Honor, the retired dean, can never forget, in the late night of a certain year, Byron’s Julius IX His Majesty the Great Iron Emperor, like a madman, inexplicably ruined the sacred objects with countless mysteries, and threw a strange stone that seemed to be of little value into a cement pool filled with strong acidity. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: In fact, according to common sense and logic, Fran and Peggy are impossible to be together, but if people want to have love, love can change everything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
