			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran received a private letter from the Earl of Hothouse the day before the end of the trainee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the letter he was portrayed by the Earl of the world as an unparalleled strategist, and those gorgeous words and titles made Fran feel quite numb. At the end, the count warmly invited him to go to Prussia in the leisure time - a tour of the hot pool family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing the letter into the drawer, Fran considers whether he needs to reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire thinking process took only five seconds and he decided to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the big nobility, this thank-you letter is purely courteous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the invitation to go to the territory to play, it is a guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no personal seal of the Earl in the letter, indicating that it is from a butler or deacon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of the nobility, noble and long-lasting blood is more important than anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One inherits only three generations, each rank must be lowered by one step, and the small family that even the noble titles are not necessarily preserved is for them. It is undoubtedly a no-grade upstart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just the Lord’s Fran, which is not the object of the social circle of the nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the month, the night is getting deeper. The spinel lamp was extinguished, and Fran lay in bed, but could not sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei did not come tonight today, used to holding the little wild cat into the dream of Fran, some time is not suitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, what position will you be holding? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking forward with a slightly nervous mood, like a kitten's claws, constantly arguing with some erratic thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everything will be tomorrow." In the darkness, Fran muttered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a mirror, Fran will be surprised to find that the reflection in himself, his eyes filled with hope and yearning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Fran just stepped into the office and received a notice to go to the oath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The affidavit is probably the least used place in the first court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many assistant prosecutors and trainee judges come to report every year, but there are very few three-month probationary periods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oath is an open space between the cloister and the building. The ground is covered with black pebbles. There are no common flowers and shrubs in the garden. Instead, the marble is in the middle. Carved into a semi-human high code sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five assistant prosecutors have gathered together, except for Peggy, others are very nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone wants to stay in the first court, no matter the promotion opportunities, salary and benefits, the aristocratic courts are much better than the small courts in the area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of places in the first court in the first half of the year was two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subtracting Peggy, the Miss Leinschmann’s Missy is not a stable place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, three of the four men currently standing in the oath are going to be eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the eyes of men are a little hostile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swearing ceremony for them is the Grand Prosecutor Milan, a middle-aged man with gold-rimmed glasses, high nose, high cheekbones, serious expression Old-fashioned, but the eyes that are slightly trapped are always slightly slanted to reveal the look of anyone who looks down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone who holds a senior position seems to have this look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a painter wants to paint a bureaucratic-themed oil painting, then Milan is the most suitable model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, please take the oath."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting his hand on the stone code, Fran closed his eyes and whispered, "...I, Fran Fryer, swear by honor, will be faithful to justice, never slacken."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indulge in a deep breath, Fran felt that his body was full of inexplicable heat, so that he could not help but shudder. The lips are hot and seem to be burning, and with the vomiting of each syllable, there is a stinging burning sensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struggled for nearly eight years and finally became a true prosecutor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps for a real big man, the prosecutor’s position is just an ordinary mid-level civil servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the eyes of the fallen Lord, it represents the bright future and the dream of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the oath ceremony, Milan spoke the answers that men most want to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first court of the solemn aristocracy will welcome two new colleagues today, they are," Milan stopped and stopped looking at Ayr. The son of the court affairs chief, excitedly raised his chest, looking forward to Milan to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the prosecutor quickly turned his gaze away, he continued, "Peggy. Don Leinschmann and Fran Fryer, please The two don't let down the trust of the first court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran's head is a little faint, and he has lost the chest badge representing the prosecutor directly under the first court. In the middle of it, the Tianping pattern, which is as delicately carved as the purple badge of the crafts, seems to be smiling at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All dreams, at this moment, have become a reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy casually played with the chest badge, looked at Fran and looked at him with a smirk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations on you." The girl took the initiative to reach Fran. At the moment of shaking hands, she took a group and screamed, "Calm down, Don't let the outdated monkeys see jokes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of view of Ayr, the two are like the first love of men and women, with some can't open The pose is hugging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The slutty scorpion." Ayr whispered in his heart, he spent a lot of money, getting up and down the joints, a major prosecutor in the first court had nodded and promised to recommend him, but the place fell to Fran On the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ayre believes that Peggy is a stalker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what Fryer’s kid used, what tricks he used, hooked up the giant lady, and let her spare no effort to seek a future for her lover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably feed her in bed." Ayre stunned Peggy with a good eye, swallowed and swallowed, and took it helplessly. Appointment book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will go to the thirteenth court in the old district to act as the acting chief judge. It is also a bad thing? If you can get rid of the two words of the agent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who will spend a sum of money and sign this appointment is really mastering the trick of collecting money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bureaucrats’ perception of wealth is no worse than that of businessmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When leaving, the acting judge stared at Fran in viciously, and he vowed to retaliate at the appropriate opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What seems to be felt, Fran looks puzzled at Ayr’s back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the good thing?" Peggy asked, she had just made an appointment with Fran, and then went to the pavilion of Bao Dian Street to celebrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ayr Duna smells like some dissatisfaction, just now he looks at my eyes, cold and ice with hatred." Fran frowned, he did not Remember when you offended him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, there is a monkey smashed, this position belongs to him." Peggy said without hesitation, said lightly, "I think you are more suitable He greeted him with his head up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franland looked at Peggy for a while, "What rights do you have to intervene in my life?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that Reinschmann never disappointed loyal people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I didn't agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are people who don't think so, they have already included you in the Leinschmann faction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Fran gnashed his teeth and shivered with anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, well, at least people with the ability to get the right position, monkeys rolling to the small court to eat bananas, everything is perfect, isn't it? Peggy shrugged indifferently. "Remember the date of the night, you have already sinned a lot of people. Please don't incur the resentment of Reinschmann."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fran hated this high and played the dominant tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Missy’s waywardness made Fran very unpleasant, one thing he had to thank Peggy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary of the first prosecution officer in the first court is not a dream for a room with a small balcony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several choices, the Bronze Apartment on the fourth floor of No. 37 Ram Street became the new home of Fran. The street outside the apartment is very lively, and you can see the famous street fountain just a few tens of meters away from the window. Fran rented a duplex room with six windows and an arcade balcony from the third to fourth floors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Flair, your vision is too accurate. This apartment has been built for only three years. The decor and furniture are all 80% new. You moved over. Even the chairs don't have to be bought.” The real estate agent patted the brown-yellow sofa under the buttocks and boasted, “If I have 5,000 gold casks, I must buy it instead of rent it.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, actually, I think the manor is better than the apartment building, at least quietly." An Mei squinted at Fulan, and he did not interrupt him. "You look so good, every month. There are no more than 50 silver Italians for rent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Flair, what is good in the manor, no one can take care of it without hiring a few servants "The businessman said, "Why, your husband works in the city. If you rent a country manor, you have to buy a carriage. It will be a wasteless expense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Known as Mrs. Flair, let An Mei's cheeks dye a layer of seductive fainting, and the little wild cat suddenly felt the fat face of the chubby real estate agent. It’s so cute, she quickly squinted at Fran and happily continued to bargain. “Well, that’s only twenty silvers. At least the carpet has to be replaced, and the old ones can be taken away.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran climbed the fourth floor from the small stairs leaning against the left wall, pushing the windows facing the street. The air on the fourth floor was much better than the ground. Every night, when the street lights were lit, the night view from this window was comfortable. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anmei’s voice with the real estate dealtapped and not bargaining came from downstairs, but the ending must end with the compromise of the little wild cat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever can hear it, An Mei’s voice contains a love for this room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cool wind swayed the curtains on both sides of the window, "Forget it," Fran said to himself, he really wanted to let go, or to the big The prosecutor applied and transferred back to the small court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy’s actions made him very angry, and no one wanted to be manipulated by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if this fate is good for you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this means that he still has to live in an old apartment in the old district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Love a person, give her a big house filled with roses," many third-rate poets say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least this sentence they are not wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that I am also a monkey who can't stand the temptation to care for the bananas." Fran smiled and slammed the wall. The sturdy masonry shocked his elbows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps came from the stairs. "Hey, the rent is still not reduced, the real estate agent is too pricey." An Mei squatted up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjusting the expression on his face, Fran took a deep breath and tried to turn it into a mess of thoughts. He turned back and prepared. Give your lover a big hug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odiles. Heterodox Court. Square<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fine breeze dilutes the smog of the dawn, and the sun lazily exudes a soft glow, and everything is a sign that today is a comfortable and good weather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for those who are about to be punished, today is not a good day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Angusus squinted at the dark waters for half a year, even the faint light, the eyes that have adapted to the dark, It is a rare stimulus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire column is not built far away, the oil-soaked grass gives off an unpleasant smell, and the one-and-a-half-high cross wooden frame stands on the haystack. In the middle, the horizontal end of the wooden frame is carved into the shape of the sword, and the vertical end is the appearance of the mace. Rio stopped and watched the flag that covered the sword and hammer on the haystack. This is the gift of the Holy See. Only when the high-ranking priests burned down, used this ritual to show the prisoners’ former differences. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sinner, don't temper, hope that Flame will make you regret." The sacred samurai looked at Rio with disgust, and he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same immersed hemp rope will tie the lining to the column, and then covered with asphalt and turpent, in order to prevent the fire from proceeding, The painful prisoner got rid of the broken rope and rushed out of the fire. At the joints, he still had a few shiny steel nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nail is not as imaginary as it is, drilling the flesh and biting into the bones. In the squeaking metal friction, some curved nails are barely strong. Connect Leo's limbs to the wooden frame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at the body of your sinner, 亵du, the torture of the years of purgatory can redeem your sins." The samurai was also secretly scared. The skin of this fallen man completely violates the laws of nature, as if it were made of metal of hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is the only evidence of his contract with the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the burning flame engulfed Leo’s body and lit him into a burning torch, the former bishop’s bishop did not show any pain. Expression, Leo looked at the East indifferently through the red and white gold fire curtains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the farthest east of the line of sight, there is a city called Feidu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, hiding his loyal servants, and the sacred devices that were once enshrined in the Holy City, given in the record by the seal of light to the first pope of the Holy See : Eternal Cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
