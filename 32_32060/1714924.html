			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It quietly crouched between the mountains of the Odile Mountains, a vast and uninhabited ridiculous land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall of huge and white rock is the periphery of it. Under the blessing of divine power, even the worst weather, there is no trace of filth on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three brown-red Romanesque dome towers stand in the middle of the square in the shape of a "pin", with a row of neatly squared red bricks The top half of the arc window, a variety of strange creature statues around the roof of the roof, the semi-circular arch coupons make the entire building solidified. The slender bridge connects the towers from each other in the air, forming the entire main hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statues of the Twelve Apostles are distributed around the main hall. Unlike the similar ones in the Holy City Square, they have been armed with armor. The sword or the hammer is a gesture of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scarlet rug with the silver edge is always laid from the steps in front of the door to the prayer table, painted with a huge cross-shaped flag of the sword and the holy hammer. Hanging on twenty-four pillars embossed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orange-based mural paints the entire zenith of the half arch, the sun, the purple clouds, the ragged aliens, the ground, praying toward the heavens The human beings, and the countless apostles who carried out the wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the morning light forms a beam of light through the windows of multicolored glass, pouring into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene in front of you is enough to make a believer who is not devout enough to squat in tears and hang on to the right wall. Repent of your own fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repression, majesty and sacredness, this is its first impression for every newcomer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if there is no looming, as if from the deepest part of the earth, including the endless pains and despair, it is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heresy court is the name of the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Roland frowned and walked slowly down the damp steps, filled with water vapor and earthy air, making his nose very uncomfortable. The thick moss that is nourished by moisture on the wall, from time to time, draws a greenish mucus on the gorgeous robe of the bishop,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it weren't for the Pope's handcuffs, he still stayed in the church of the Holy City and enjoyed the reverence and worship of the believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one wants to deal with the sadistics in the courtroom, even if he is a bishop. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This groundwater is strangely shaped and sticks with dry blood. The Roland has been recognized for a long time, and only recognizes iron virgins and spiked baskets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the sadistics have invented many new things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monsters made of wood and iron, just look at it, they feel the pain is uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to imagine that someone could have been tortured by these things for half a year without regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the Lord, I would rather choose ten fires than to give an hour here." Roland meditated in the bottom of his heart, but immediately The unlucky thoughts are very remorseful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the torture room, in the deeper underground, the rows are tied by chains, soaked in wooden cages in the water, lying with a lot of belts The pagans who are terrible wounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there were no wailing and whispering curses, Roland really thought that there was only a body in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, someone is an exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the cage, the middle-aged man with the upper body leaned against the cage, and under the swaying light of the wall torch, the pale skin was slightly reflected. The light of metal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leo. Angotes." Roland stopped at the distance of ten steps, "or call you Cardinal, the entire Anno identity. The most distinguished thief. Of course, in front of the throne of the seal of light, all dignity and arrogance are equally humble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rio lifted his head and barely exposed A taunting smile, perhaps also want to swear a few words - if his tongue was not abolished in the last torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sorry, originally you will have a glorious future, if you have not abandoned the light, fall into the abyss of heresy." Roland prayed a few words, as if heresy The word smeared his mouth and then raised his voice. "Where is the artifact that you steal, and the sinful research material, where is it hidden? Perhaps the Holy See would kindly choose a glass of poisonous wine instead of the firearms on the square. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
