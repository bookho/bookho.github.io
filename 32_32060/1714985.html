			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Rauvita Whitemane was just unemployed and led the monthly salary from the side door of the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She worked in the hotel’s laundry room for a year and a half, cleaning the guest’s underwear and soiled sheets quilt daily, only three in the laundry room. A famous female worker, but full of clothes, there are many big scorpions that are sent to be washed. There is always work, dry one by one, from morning until midnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sultry laundry room makes her full of soapy greasy taste. Like every laundry lady, her eyes are red and bloody, not Less skin is swollen by water, and there is a pale pathological condition in the face. When the liquid soap is prepared by washing, it will produce a slightly decaying gas. It has been devastating to the lungs for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will believe that a young girl will choose the job of laundry, and Lauvita will have more capital to provide a better life for herself. She is very beautiful, slim, white skin, pale yellow hair tied into a debate, on the head, there is a pitiful and pitiful appearance in the eyebrows, gray eyes like the moonlight night sky. She always put her left hand in her pocket. When she encounters a forced situation, she will remember to wear gloves because she doesn't like being seen by people. The whole left hand, from the back of the hand to the elbow, has a layer of blue and white horny skin, as if The natural armor, in sharp contrast to it, is a rounded, five-powder shape with a lovely round nail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magical feature does not damage the girl’s natural beauty, but rather evokes the interest of men in hunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should be able to recall the lawsuit of a few years ago, the Goethe girl who lost her father because of her beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have more money, can you change back to your loved ones?" Lauvita shed tears and puts his father into the coffin. At the funeral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has no relatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman who wants to live in the fee is not easy, bar girls, laundry workers, weavers. Or finding a rich man is the way out for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first went to work in the laundry room, the other two looks obviously unable to adapt to the female female worker. In private discussion, "This playful girl is not out for a month. Will find another job."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a month later, when they saw that Lauvita still struggled with dirty clothes and soap foam, he said, "The lobby foreman is very fond of her. Hey, as long as there is a hint of teasing, she can quickly go to the lobby to entertain. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lobby foreman is a 30-year-old gentleman who is full of mature men's tastes and manners. As long as he spoke, the hotel's waiters were all sentimental. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Soon" this period lasted for half a year, the foreman finally lost patience, "Whiteman, baby, look, I just have a mouth. You have to lose your job. It’s not easy to find a job this year, but I don’t do it, so you have to say something.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreman to Lavetta A key. "10 o'clock in the evening, room 7 on the fourth floor. The room is currently empty, I have the right to use it for free for a few times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luovita is not angry or ashamed , cheeks red, "10 o'clock? Room 7?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, baby, I have prepared red wine, you have not touched it. The high-end goods.” The foreman said that he was a veteran. “I only had candles at the time, and the atmosphere was great. I was a little drunk and went to bed, more comfortable.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night until eleven o'clock, Lauvita did not come, the foreman had already drank a few glasses of wine, and the heat made him take off his coat and unbutton the shirt. "The girl, I must fire her tomorrow." After a few minutes, the foreman heard the sound of the key turning the door lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said. No small staff dared to ignore the superior." The foreman showed a triumphant smile, he had already been unable to hold his inner hunger, waiting for the door. When I opened it, I couldn’t wait to rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alcohol, dim candlelight, so that the foreman did not see the appearance of the person, until he found that the human body in the arms was bloated, the hand held * * Smaller than you think, the face that kisses your mouth, seems to be late when you have a hard beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guest shouted in horror and alerted the people and security guards throughout the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Someone wants to rape me, God, still a man." The tears of the guests came out. "How did this hotel work? I have lived a dozen times. Didn't encounter this kind of thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreman finally saw clearly that the fat man was a wealthy guest of the hotel, a very wealthy financier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He desperately began to imagine the fall of the unemployed, no hotel, would hire a foreman trying to rape customers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager came over and said to him, "Come to my office."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the request is made to save the job, the foreman must pounce on it. But the manager's words made him hope. "You are an old employee. Do you know that I am very embarrassed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘿! My usual work performance has touched the top, and there are dramas! The foreman said gracefully, "I beg you, I have been working in the hotel for nearly ten years and have always performed well. As long as I can press today, I will agree on anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, anything." He stressed that he also vowed that as long as he was lucky enough to escape this today, he must The stinky lady was fired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager’s face showed a kind smile, and he patted the foreman’s shoulder affectionately. “You are an old staff member of the hotel, capable of having a wrist, and... "The manager's hand slowly walked down the river, stroking his chest, hehe, the chest slightly dotted with the chest hair, can be considered sexy in the eyes of women. "We are still the same, I knew that I have promoted you before. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreman finally realized that the boss had an unknown hobby, and he was shocked to see the manager drop the pants to the ankle, revealing the lower part of the bulging . He gasped. "Use your mouth, or, I will fire you now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article is the first text version of the 16k novel network, which can not be reproduced without permission. , more recent and fastest chapters, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat financier calmed down in the room department manager and calmed down. "Scared me." He rubbed his sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, all your expenses for this time are free, just beg you not to pass on today's events." Room Manager picks up the financier with the room card The key looked. "Hey, the front desk record is that you live on the fourth floor, room number 9, here is number 7."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows. You must have made a mistake." The fat man remembered that when he went upstairs, he collided with a beautiful waiter wearing a hotel uniform, and the key on his hand was knocked out. The waiter picked it up for him. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr., please forgive me." The waiter sent the key back to him, and he took the opportunity to touch it a few times. The slippery feeling seemed to touch a horse. Good silk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the little girl got it wrong, but the fat man was too lazy to say, "Including all the meals for the next two days, I have to be a bloody Mary for 24 years. He bargained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room manager agreed to calm down the incident and was distressed at the price of the bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita is still unemployed. The next morning, she was surprised to see that the foreman who was supposed to be fired was full of face and licking his ass. Turned over and shouted at her hoarsely, "You are rolling now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She played a little trick, wanting to keep her job without having to be dirty The deal, but apparently did not succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is my salary this month?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You burned a few clothes, Didn't find you compensation is already kind, actually wants to pay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please show the accident receipt, the hotel has this rule, if it is filthy, I will choose to complain Labor Court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss, please go, I see you can't afford the lawyer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Mr. Foreman, your neck..." Lauvita saw the foreman panicking up the collar and covering the neck with bruises. The girl didn't know that it was a trace left behind after the kiss, but the foreman thought it was Found that he does not want to be the object of rumors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you can get the money, but leave the hotel right away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get out of the hotel, It was the hour of lunch, and Lauvita walked on the street, looking at the window of a restaurant and admiring the customers of tender steak and creamy mushrooms. She touched the money in her pocket. If the money was rubbed, she could barely maintain it for a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
