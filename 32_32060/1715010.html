			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The band wears elegant blue uniforms, timpani, loupe and bagpipes, playing the spring water for the breakfast guests in the restaurant. Light music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barryi Silana had a terrible headache and had a low fever. Last night's few toilets made her cool. Originally, today's plan was to visit the Tandoori Theatre and various places of interest, but she really couldn't take a step. In order not to sweep everyone's happiness, Baru Qiang endured discomfort, and after sharing the meal with the employees, he simply left a reason to stay at the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spicy taste of the mustard shell meat on the plate made Barrie's nose slightly more comfortable, but the throat was immediately coughed up. "Forget it, go to sleep." She pulled the rest of the shellfish, sighed, put down her fork, barely stood up, head-to-head walking upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're fine." Just at breakfast, Quasimodo seemed to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course nothing, very good." Barry said indifferently, but my heart was very nervous, the head said excitedly in his heart, he saw it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casimodo nodded and did not ask. This made her feel relieved and lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, no one can see it, I am sick." Barrie resentfully thought, although pretending to be healthy, afraid to bring trouble to others, but inside In the depths, I still longed for someone to perceive and care for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the team did not see, there are individuals watching this side. When her footsteps disappeared unsteadily at the corner of the stairs, Fran came out of the shelter and came to the front desk to hand the receptionist a pack of antipyretics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Silana on the third floor seems to be sick and handed it over to her." Fran told the reception, "If you burn at noon, you still haven't retired." Go to the doctor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, Grandpa Knight, don't you send it in person?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I still have something." Fran again shouted. "Don't say that the medicine was bought by me, um.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is said that you noticed her discomfort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But why?" The receptionist was very strange. He knew that these two men were members of the Cardinals, but they made God mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to know too much, please help me keep this little secret." Fran answered, "It's good for you, at the right time, I will Praise your work performance to the lobby manager."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Although the receptionist couldn’t figure out what’s going on, he didn’t cleverly ask. VIP recommendations and timely detection of the guests are not appropriate. They will let themselves evaluate the rise, which will be of great benefit to future promotion and salary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This stupid woman who will not take care of herself." Fran shook his head and walked out of the hotel. There were a lot of taxis in front of the door, and he picked the car to look the cleanest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that there is a horse race today." Fran said to the coachman, "Take me to the racecourse."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you going to the big arena in the city or the sky racecourse in the suburbs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard people talk about the sky today The race at the racecourse is an official tournament. Go there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the sky before getting on the bus, the sun was shining, but under the guidance of Master William Fran had mastered some preliminary astrology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars last night told him. There may be a torrential rain that will come quickly this afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sky Racecourse is located on the banks of the hills outside Tantin. Only one mile from the city gate. It used to be a piece of wood, and the surrounding clods were covered with tall trees. Walking along the road, you can see a quarter of a length. About half of the wide horse farm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrain here is very suitable for horse races. The riverside grass grows vigorously. Only the circular runway is properly cut and nailed. A solid wooden grille. The marble platform is located on the leftmost center of the platform. Above the stands, twelve pillars support a hard canvas canopy. The shed is a brightly colored Masek painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The edge of the platform is a railing around the 箩 纹理 texture, every distance of the railing is covered with a thick soft pad, which is when the horse runs After the platform. The place where the audience used the telescope to look at the elbow. Large sun umbrellas and small tables on the platform, this hour, are filled with people, the city's leisure bureaucrats, rich and lady, almost all gathered here, watching horse racing in Tanding, is a fashionable social event . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to bet on a small amount of money, just call the waiter and write the amount of the bet and the horse on a special paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. It is a restroom with a horse stable and a jockey. Each horse and jockey has one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, old man, be sure to win!" Mike wiped the body of the horse with hay and let his muscles get hot so that he could enter the state immediately when he was running. . The jockey is very young, with a slight fluff on his lips, and his blue eyes are ashamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the jockeys who passed through the door and talked to the sponsors to assure them a decent place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many people used to hold money, want to be the patron of you and your father." He touched the wet sweat on the horse, this is the door to learn, excellent The jockey can judge whether he has entered the best condition by how much he sweats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s a frequent visitor to a horse, you should remember the name “cutting the wind”, which has won at least 14 official championships with the owner. It is a regular victory general on the racecourse. But an accident ruined everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, in a regular lap, the wind hoof slipped, fell, and broke the front leg. Mike’s father was thrown out, like a tomato on the ground, and he couldn’t move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disabled jockey, with a horse that had broken his leg, was destined to withdraw from the athletics track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the son of the jockey, Mike, took the wind and returned to the racecourse again, he immediately ridiculed. No one believes that rookie riders and broken legs can make a difference. In fact, the same is true, the cut wind ran three times, each time is the position of the mat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The father’s medicine, and the cost of living at home, are up to you." Mike whispered that the jockey’s income depends mainly on bonuses and sponsor’s investment. He can only get a meager appearance fee, and the horse farm owner told him a few days ago that if he ran out of the last one, then even the appearance fee was gone. The audience will not bet on a horse that is destined to fail, and the racecourse will not allow any unpaid employees to pay any compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a good horse." When he was thinking, Mike heard someone talking, and he turned around and saw a tall ugly man. The man was wearing a gray shirt and a pair of dark brown twill trousers, putting the jacket on the elbow, watching the wind cut with admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just heard that the entire racecourse, only your no one sponsored?" Fran touched the horse. "I originally wanted to buy a red electric, but his master, a lord of love horse, refused to sell it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike blushes, this Is man coming to fight his own confidence, "Yes." He said with a bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I invest, how?" Fran said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr...." Mike couldn't believe his own ear. "Would you like to sponsor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Four hundred pieces a month. Or buy it directly with 20,000 yuan." If you promise him, you won't worry about the money! Mike shouted in his heart, but the honesty of young people gradually gained the upper hand. "You may not know that it was seriously injured before, and it is very old. The chances of running a good grade are not high. And this is "Puma"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"阉马?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the wind of the cut is very Ok, but the first to start. It is a military horse. You know, in order to prevent riots during estrus, the military horses have to be castrated," Mike said. "So it can't be a stallion, your investment can't be recovered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out, but it's better." Fran thought, he Smiling and counting the money from the purse, "In order to praise your honesty, I decided to sponsor it for one month and five hundred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the witness of the racecourse notary He signed a two-year contract with Mike until the contract was held in his hand, and the little jockey still felt dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking forward to playing in half an hour." Fran patted the jockey's shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched the bottle in his arms. Inside is the bottle of crimson energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that this potion in the potions category is horrible and effective against any creature. Lian Fulan, a living corpse that is maintained by the Holy Power, only tastes a small mouth and can lose his mind and fall into the abyss of **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The text translated by Cecilia gives Fran a better understanding of the use and efficacy of the energy agent. When diluted, it can be used as an inducer to trigger **. If the concentration reaches a certain range, it also has the ability to paralyze the heart, and will not be detected by any means of measurement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Fran is still an ordinary person, drinking the mouth is enough to make himself lose his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by adding or subtracting a medium, the potion can be re-designated rather than immediately effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the first few recipes in the book. It’s hard to imagine that the latter ingredients are more complicated, the production process is more cumbersome, and the power can be To what extent is it amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the bottle, dyed the red silk handkerchief, and came to the stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come so sweaty?" Fran did not know how to do it, and the handkerchief carefully wiped the windy buttocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a warm-up that will keep the horse's muscles in good shape before the game."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Hey, you are a good expert." Fran said that he blessed a few words and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a remote corner, he threw the towel and the glove with the potion on the floor and burned it with a lighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the accident that was difficult to say, Fran was extremely careful about the use of the drug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Tandin’s horse racing enthusiasts has a strict top private club. This club has an unwritten rule: members must have a champion horse. People, otherwise they will have money and power, and they cannot join. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finance Minister The core figure of the Emperor Party, one of the opponents of the Gorse, is an important member of the club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to buy a good horse in a hurry, hire a good rider and trainer, and then win several championships. It’s too time consuming. I had to play tricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord of the Knights, Zheng Zhiqing, can actually reunite here." Fran heard that someone called him, met at the St. George Hotel in Ifsets The couple of Captain Kate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady happily waved at him. "I was still talking to you about my husband."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can be beautifully hanged on the lips, it's mine "I am honored." Fran kissed on the back of her hand, "Your new hat is beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, the most popular this summer Style, you see, this specially cut bodhisattva..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, dear, talking about clothes is not a topic for men." Viscount Kate Haha Laugh, "Sorry, she talks about dressing up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you please let me complain," Mrs. Lan said, "He loves horses and loves me. Even at night, I can't wait to sleep in the stables." The Viscounts and the couple blamed each other, but the words were full of flirtatious sweetness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember the last time you said that you have a good horse." Fran asked, he heard it at the St. George Hotel. The Viscount is a horse idiot. The topic of the day, in addition to Fran's adventure story, is Kate's breeding horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The horse is the masterpiece of the creator, don't blame you, wait for my moon god to appear, the second generation of pure blood horse, run like the moon The glory of the priest. "The prince Kate fluttered." It won six championships. Some even want to spend 100,000 pieces to buy from me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, true Not bad, I just invested in a horse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great, will it come out today?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it’s No. 7." Fran pointed to the jockeys on the runway and was preparing to race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Day, No. 7? That is the wind!" The Viscount sighed. "My great adventurer, you are a good player for adventure, but for the horse. It’s not very good.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I think it’s bigger than age. This horse is very good and has won more than ten championships.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like a aging warrior, withered flowers. Losing speed is also a sad thing for the horses.” The viscount said, “The wind cuts off the legs and the people are suffocating. Speed ​​is no longer there. If you watched the previous games, you will definitely not spend half a dime on it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope it won a few championship titles for me." Fran shrugged his shoulders in disapproval. "And I have great confidence in my eyesight, and cutting the wind is a horse of fortune."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortune?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, whether it is a resourceful or a force, it is more important than luck. I have met in the sea." The worst storm, in the case of a few days of water in the desert, miraculously find an oasis.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luck, always carry out the life of the people, whether it is the Lord The emperor must be blessed with his favor and care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are so amazing, but I never think that the wind can run a good place." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So bet, if my horse can beat your horse on the court, then Luna will belong to me, if the result happens to be reversed, I Send you 100,000 pieces."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. This is unfair to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You are a strange The adventurer wants to squander his wealth." Fran said earnestly, "100,000 is just a small number, but it allows me to experience the boiling of the blood in the face of the unknown."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That...well." Kate does not believe that his love for the horse will fail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the bells on the field were ringing, and the seven riders steered the horse and walked onto the runway. The jockeys of Luna and Chihua both wore bright red coats, while others wore light-colored clothes. In Byron, only the jockey who has won the championship in the near future is qualified to use the red knight suit to show off the honor he has achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the leather stables and knight suits, you can see striking family emblems or signs, which belong to the family of the horse sponsors. For example, the back of the moon god jockey's clothes has a leopard head with a side image, which is the badge of the Viscounts of Kate, and the red electric lion is four black lions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because time is too late, the wind does not draw any mark. When Mike takes a few deep breaths and leads the mount to the starting line, the stand is warm and friendly. The applause, many people know this good horse and feel sorry for its encounter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell stopped after ten knocks, and the audience suddenly fell silent. After a short silence, the horn blew and the jockey slammed the horse's belly with the spurs and rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first two laps, the cut wind was the third last, and ranked first in the red, leading the second half of the Luna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job, bite it!" The Viscount put down the telescope, clenched his fists, and his face was flushed. "The lure of the moon is full of strength. The easier it is to play the advantage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Lord Zhengzhiqing." The Viscountess loved this fresh title. "Your horse seems to fall behind." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said that miracles will always appear." Fran answered. He calculated that the syrup that penetrated into the body, through the excretion of sweat and the high temperature transpiration of the skin during running, should work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaos occurred on the fifth lap. The sky is a little cloudy, it seems that a summer rain is about to fall, and the thunder of the rolling is also dull in the sky. Every horse is sweating, and Luna has already reached the forefront, but at this time, it suddenly puts his head in confusion, no longer obeys the jockey’s command, and screams upright, not only Luna, other The horse also appeared inexplicably excited and to varying degrees, even a horse, mouth open to the nearest class. In estrus, there is often a fierce battle between the stallions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the wind has not been affected, and straight to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire grandstand was stunned, especially the Viscount Kate, and the telescope slipped from his hand. "How could it be!" he murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan grasps the dose very accurately, the chaos only lasts for half a minute, and the champion has already produced when the horses are waking up and regaining their temperament. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the end of the tournament, people still talk about the things that are genius. The opinion that everyone can be convinced is that the horses were frightened by the thunder in the middle of the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The speed of the cut is not good, but the experience is still there, it is worthy of the veteran champion horse." They admire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viscount of Kate had completely lost his blood, his feet were shaking, "Jazz Knight, willing to gamble and lose, the god of the moon is yours." The word is almost squeezed out of the throat. One, the person who loves the horse, loses his cherished horse to others. This feeling is almost devastating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be serious, it's just a joke." Fran refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If a nobleman can't make his own promises according to the convention, then he will have no face." The Viscount brought the moon god and stuffed the reins In the hands of Fran, don't look over, can't bear to look again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, beautiful lady." Fran smiled and said to the Viscountess who comforted her husband, "It seems that I have not given you any gifts. Byron I am not clear about the etiquette, but in Ingmar, this is really a serious rudeness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He handed the rope to the Viscountess, "I hope this gift You can like it, please be sure to accept it so that I can save the reputation of not paying attention to etiquette."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount knows why the other party is doing this, and he is almost moved to tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran’s impression in his mind has risen from an adventurer to a generous philanthropist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the farewell, the Viscount shouted, "Right, I wonder if you are interested in the Pegasus Club?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have heard of this club, but the requirements are strict, not only need to have a famous horse, but also have to be recommended by members."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your cut The wind already has this qualification, and it is recommended..." The Viscount patted the head of the Luna. "I happen to be an old member of Pegasus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" When I meet at the club, I will recommend you to the members.” He started the exclusive text version and can't reprint it, pick it up, and get the latest and fastest chapter without permission. Please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars of last night told Fran that there would be heavy rain today. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this omen is not simply about the climate. When he entered the Heihe Hotel, he saw the head of the reinstatement that had burned back most of the life and regained vitality. Behind her, the pretty girl with white gold hair and ivory skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Day, just a good gentleman named Zolfa Longqi, actually sent our Matilda back!" The head of the head licked his chest Shout, "praise the kingdom of heaven, let the father and the daughter reunite!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
