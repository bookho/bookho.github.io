			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The citizens of Feidu’s wealthy area found that there were several teams of guards in the streets and lanes, Mutu Square in front of the First Aristocratic Court. There are a lot of plainclothes spies in Minhou. They occupy the benches under the shadow of the mottled trees. They use newspapers to block their faces. Only when they look up occasionally, they show a pair of vigilant eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire first court was almost concealed by the army, and it was solid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sensitive media seems to be aware of the difference, the authorities’ reply is: no comment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can expect that the Chujun couple who were on a honeymoon trip arrived in Feidu last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blowing from the Dead Sea makes the warm spring of Feidu full of a moist and sticky, Peggy dyed some cold, when getting up in the morning, She felt a little stuffy. The royal doctor hurriedly prescribed the medicine so as not to delay the trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The soil is not satisfied, although I have been here for two and a half years, but can not adapt to its climate." Missy took out a paper towel, hit a Sneezing, tears in the eyes, but little pain does not affect her spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why are you still paying for it?" Julius seems to have recovered from grief, but his eyes are still hidden. Suddenly. He reached out and tried to hold his wife's hand. He just took the soft, cold sight and cast it on his face, freezing his enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, only this time." Peggy gently took out his hand. "Let's go, don't let the monkeys in the first court wait. Speak up. I haven't fed bananas for a long time. "Looking at his wife's back, Julius thought with dismay: I thought the relationship had improved a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At nine o'clock in the morning, the Crown Prince and his wife were light and simple, with a small amount of jealousy coming from a secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first bell of the first court slammed seventeen times, posing as a salute, and subtly paying tribute to His Royal Highness. The staff in the court were lame, strangely unusual today. They were told that there would be high-level visits, but they did not expect that they were members of the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President of the General Court, Carmen, has been waiting for a long time. He respectfully bowed to the Prince's Temple. A few years ago, although the girl was a prominent figure, she was still subordinate to his subordinates. Now, no matter what aspect, she is far superior to her former colleagues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two Highnesses, this will be the most memorable glory of the first court of the capital. It will be recorded in the history of the court. It will be passed on forever. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are polite, and when I was studying in the court, I was taken care of by you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where the wife stayed when she first entered the judiciary. Julius eagerly looked at the portrait relief between the arches of the gate and said to the count, "I am still coming for the first time. You are the master of the first court. Let me introduce it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Carmen replied in a flattering manner, "I will always be the servant of His Majesty the Emperor and His Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All planned The news was delayed until the afternoon. In addition to the large prosecutor is eligible to accompany. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are ordered to stay in their own offices and are not allowed to go out at will, so the court is quiet. I couldn’t hear the tongues of the prosecutors and lawyers in the past, the muffled sound when the hammer fell, and the audience were stunned. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked through the corridors, and the President of the General Court spoke vividly about the passing and secrets of some famous cases. The first court has a long history and almost endless stories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever he passed a courtroom, he stopped and said proudly, "There was an appeal from a case that led to the addition of a code to the law." New interpretation clause."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was a trial of an annosian bishop here. The prosecutors of the first court resisted the pressure of the church and he was sentenced To steal state secrets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius couldn’t insert his mouth, only quietly smiling, listening to his wife and the president’s conversation about The little jokes of the legal anecdote, those who only have the insiders to understand where the laughter is, are boring for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they passed the first quotation hall, the president said, "Hah, Your Royal Highness. You still remember, a case about futures fraud, the city." Several aristocratic gentlemen were deceived. As a result, the prosecutor used a clever way to punish the liar, but he used the gorse privately. You were born in the family name and had to say that it was too bold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, can you tell me something?" Julius finally had something to understand, and he couldn't help but be interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...He said to the suspect: Dear Sir, for sin or fraud, please choose." The President of the General Assembly vividly described the time. After. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although there are some oversteps, it is really interesting." The Crown Prince looked at the court officials who followed him and said with a smile, "Which gentleman's masterpiece? I I think, a smart person like this has at least been seated in the position of a big prosecutor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, there was a tragedy, he called... ..." The president of the court saw the secretary secretly trying to give himself a look. He suddenly remembered something and found himself talking too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His name is Fran Fryer, my best student, used to be." A bald, fat and short prosecutor snoring Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone quickly pulled his clothes and whispered, "Lord Camiro, don't say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp They noticed that Wang Hao was gloomy and had picked up a piece of dusty memory. The anecdote between a probation officer and a wealthy celebrity, in the eyes of others, they have a relationship and often dine together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecutor with no background can finally stay in the first court, and the name warms up a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time everyone believed that the two would definitely have different general friendships, such as **, such as a comfortable and soft bed...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you know more about the inside of Carmen, guess, in the end, the famous entertainment made the trick to frame the person, but also because of love and hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the probation officer is dead, and the name of the giant is warm, and it is the prince of the reserve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, there was an unspeakable mysterious atmosphere in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Highness, please come, not far from the atrium, is the swearing-in hall." The President of the General hastened to shift the topic and annihilate this sudden storm. Unknowingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julius doubtfully took their eyes to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to a place, go now." Peggy whispered to her husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is very rude." Julius replied, "But everything goes with you. Where do you want to go? Let the servants prepare in advance." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I have my own arrangements, you can continue to visit, don't follow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wang Hao’s sudden remarks caused a little confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Carmen felt terrible, and he hated his own mouth. Although I don't know the specific feelings of the Crown Prince couple. But what happened after 10,000 days? He does not want to wear the title of "the relationship between the husband and wife." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can offend the royal family and the gorse family at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Fryer slowly walks through the path of the public cemetery in the old district. He wears a customary trench coat and wears a white terracotta in his chest pocket. Pu. With a black lip, the face and nose are properly shaped, and the soft mold that changes the color of the glutinous rice is worn in the eyes. Even if you go around the patrol hall, no one will notice that he is a few days ago. . The suspect who escaped from the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked to the top of the tombstone in front of the tombstone, placed Ge Pu on the pedestal of the leftmost tombstone, buried under the soil Old man. He closed his eyes and prayed for the peace of the soul of the deceased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a minute, he turned his eyes to the other two tombs and read the names above silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fran Fryer. "I am still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Ann Roser. "You are alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled calmly, clenched his fists, violently exerted his strength, was violently splattered by wind and rain, and could not resist the brute force of a man. He squatted. The flesh is broken. The bones split open until the two monuments with meaningless names became fragments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Spirit is naturally launched. A little bit of white light lingers in the injured area, and quickly, makes the skin look as clean as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, Grandma, disturbing your rest." Fran said, "Although fate made me and her go on the road, but don't Sad for us. In a sense, we are all alive, isn't it something worthy of joy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He unfolds his arms and wants to scream. But the words came to the lips and were suppressed into a light complaint. "Is it interesting? That is the hand of the fate of the ordinary people! You have destroyed my life, but please don't continue to manipulate the fate of my loved ones, if she If there is any sin, I will bear it. Sooner or later, I will pull her back to the normal track and enjoy the happiness of mortals, even if there are ghosts and ghosts in front of me! You are in the clouds. Overlooking the mortal beings, then please open your eyes. Look carefully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to His Royal Highness, the royal family members found out from the Feidu Civil Affairs Bureau where a dead person was buried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you need to buy flowers, Your Highness?" They are going to visit a deceased friend and prepare to buy a few cars to chase the white flowers of the deceased. The entire tombstone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not going to visit old friends, just to laugh at a stupid monkey." Peggy refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no customary grave-sweeping day, the old cemetery is empty, the grass grows deep, it seems a bit ridiculous. Plainclothes police officers searched every corner in advance and ensured safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the store arrived, she let everyone stay on the perimeter and enter alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cemetery is not well planned, the monument is messy and unobtrusive, Peggy takes a deep breath, the smell of mulch makes her nose more uncomfortable . Missy stepped on the weedy road and looked around for something to look for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After a forked ramp, turn left, the west side." She muttered and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many tombstones that have not been taken care of over the years. They are extremely untidy, some are covered with moss, some are cracked with fine lines, some The engraved inscriptions have long been blurred because of the wind erosion. However, in front of Miss Da’s eyes, it was apparently artificially deliberately damaged. After careful observation, she rolled from a nearby piece to the stone tablets in the haystack and found the words “Fran, Eph...”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second half of the name didn't know where to go, but Peggy knew that the ruins of the small ruins in front of her were the destinations of the visit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, is there a more tragic monkey than you? You can’t be dead if you die." The girl almost sneered, she thought she wouldn’t want to laugh. However, she always has a sulking sullenness in her chest, and she does not know why her emotions are fluctuating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, she did not hypocritically cover up her true thoughts. "Sometimes, I will also think about it. If you are alive, the world will be more interesting." Miss her arms around her chest and said to the air, "In fact, there are many kinds of situations that can prevent you from dying. If my wrist is mature at that time, you can help you to follow behind, if you It’s also a little secular, not blinded by stupid beliefs and high-level eyes, so... how good.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She kicked and kicked the ground The gravel, "Well, I have talked about a love in Feidu. Yes, you should be unclear. Even if I am myself, I will gradually understand. For me, the so-called love is not an animal." I also despise the creamy romantic, my man, must be strong and rational, can entrust his back to him, I thought you would be the expected person. Peggy Fryer, perhaps Fran Tang Reinschmann, for a while, I seem to have made such a fight in my subconscious mind. The name.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your soul is listening, I will tell you that you probably thought that I was dominating you, manipulating you, trying to conquer you, but conquering and being Conquest is the positive and negative of the coin, which cannot be separated from each other.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Feidu, I am still too young, just coming out of the law school books, this Reason, I didn’t know it until five years later.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her pale fingers slowly stroked the name inscribed on the tombstone. “I am a stone heart. The arrogant woman is not ashamed of this character, so don't think that I am apologizing and remorse. I am now living under the power of Peggy von Como, and you, I can only listen. The soul of the dead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened her hand and looked at the stone with a blank expression from the palm of her hand and rolled into the depths of the grass.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what happened before, now, it is no longer important, isn't it?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
