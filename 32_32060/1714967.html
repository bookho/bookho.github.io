			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Carl Tiven’s assistant prosecutor is on vacation from Dalmark’s city Zonvia, his hair is gray and his lips are small Beard, "There is nothing interesting in the west."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just got off the bus stop in the city, standing on the streets of Sevia, the wind filled with sand He feels very bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Byron’s judiciary, Carl Tiven is a small, insignificant person, a local court, with an annual income of 2,000 Caesar, a person like him, More than a cow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in his thirties and had no hope of promotion. He was transferred between several small courts and looked at the trainees who entered the court in the same year. When he was sitting in the position of the court chief or the official prosecutor, he began to repent and did not choose the wrong profession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half a month ago, he had just received a warrant from the prosecutor in a circuit court in the western mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nominally a promotion, but the conditions of the National Circuit Court are far from being mixed up in the district courts of the city. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that some circuit courts have only one carriage, and they are also used as transportation means, taking into account the duties of the accommodation and the courtroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl couldn’t imagine that he had to drive the carriage and go back and forth between the small villages to mediate some trivial things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is money, I can change a good place." Carl thought, this idea also shows that there is still a black hole in the judiciary. He was born in general. In the four years of studying at the law school, he has already spent the rest of his family. The parents who opened the grocery store are proud of having the son of a prosecutor, but Carl is not satisfied. ? He is usually obsessed with playing baccarat, the kind of color, but the luck is always bad, always lose money, the days are too tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even a rare long vacation, he can only choose Sevia, in order to travel to the court to report, can save travel costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are still more than half a month. I will definitely finish the holiday and start working in the country." Carl sighed and waved to the carriage. "Go clean and cheap." Hotel," he said to the coachman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaning on the chair of the carriage, Carl opened the suitcase and prepared to take some change. Immediately, he was stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the box. It was a new ticket, and Carl quickly closed the lid and looked around in horror, but quickly relieved that he was alone in the car, and who could see it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost ten thousand Caesar! He touched the money and felt that there was some lack of oxygen. What happened? Carl recalled that on the big bus in the public station, the one sitting next to him was wearing a hat. I can't see the big man in the face. Carrying the suitcase is exactly the same as his. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big man didn’t get off at Sevia, and the man was flustered. Take his box as his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carr secretly complained that the big man took up too many places and squeezed him uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a letter of introduction from the Chamber of Commerce in the box. The words in the line indicate that the original owner is a fledgling trader with no background, ready to come to the west to buy gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Father is also punishing you." Carl happily thought that there were only a few hundred in his suitcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional court orders and documents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only suffices to go back to the original court to reissue, and it takes a lot of work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten thousand Caesar is not too much, not enough to bribe a good position, but at least to ensure that he can be luxuriously back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carl opened the door slightly and called the coachman, "Go to a better hotel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "After a night, I remember the city of Pena, the most famous casino in the country. The poker inside. It is all wrapped in gold." Carl calculated, "Maybe the owner will find the door through the documents, if you win I will return the money to him, but I lost it, sorry, an ordinary businessman, don't want to fight in the court and prosecutors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When getting off, Carl asked in detail about the fastest way to go to Pena. "The public bus station has a week, but it is enough to pack one for three days." The driver answered and enthusiastically recommended, "Sit in my carriage, keep it safe." Send you quickly and easily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, since the enjoyment is thorough, Carl decided to find a four-horse luxury carriage, maybe find another girl, can pass the time in the boring scene of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Carl walked into the hotel, the driver turned his head in disappointment. At the end of the street not far away, the carriage was blocked by one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't take the car, please tell me, the passengers are just like you asked what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The coachman looked a little dazed at the tall and strong physique of the coming, "First...sir, this should be a private secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big man from the clip Take out a stack of money, count a few, and take a few, "Would you like them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...but..." The coachman’s throat squirmed The sound of swallowing sputum is heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, not enough?" He took out another one and stuffed the ticket into the driver's hand, waiting and smiling. "Now, you can say it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation lasted for five minutes and both sides got results that satisfied themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving, the person warned, "Maybe you have already guessed my identity, that person is the object of surveillance in the hall, so what happened today, don't Say to anyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the big man turning around the corner, disappearing in the alley, "The hall? Is that a secret policeman?" The driver sighed with relief. He swears to keep his mouth shut, so as not to bring unbearable troubles to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan checks the documents, Carl is a prosecutor who has been in the South for many years Officials, small towns in the west, no one will recognize them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you meet Carl Tiewen’s former acquaintance, it’s hard to say, it’s going to be a tragic ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, Fran has to gamble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single-handedly entered the castle, found the girl, pulled her on the horse, and ran across the soldiers to run towards the setting sun. Only in the knight's novels would such a scene appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
