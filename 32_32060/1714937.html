			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number one wanted to be arrested has sensationalized the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overnight, Inspector Lyme became a well-known big star. On the way to and from work, the old inspector was often rewarded by passers-by, even bold. The girls at the point rushed forward to give a kiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Feidu people who were suppressed by the city order seemed to find a way to vent, and they cheered and screamed at the inspector’s bravery, shouting, "Tangle Igo Andech! Hang this villain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the important samurai, they were intentionally forgotten, "噢There is no need to give credit to those who are in trouble." People think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is better than a sullen trial in a dull day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the gossip, the chief judge will be Fran Fryer, the most promising prosecutor of the capital, Vs, the most notorious The notorious criminals, this star lineup has made the enthusiasm of the whole city high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internal affairs officer of the first court started to have a headache and how to arrange a seat. The largest courtroom has only four hundred seats, and there is a door to the seat. Can be counted in thousands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be predicted that on the day of the trial, the ordinary citizens who join in the fun will be lined up in front of the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, we have a higher attendance rate than the Opera House. If you receive tickets, you will make a small fortune." . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumors have not gone wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran received a notice from the chief auditor, and the chief of the court, Carmen, held a special meeting for this purpose. "In fact, the Metropolitan Royal Court wanted to hand over the prisoner." To Tantin, but since the Feidu people seized the criminals, they should all be tried by the people. The rulings of the Royal Court who only know the endorsements do not want to divide the honors belonging to the Feidu Judicature. Although the Frey prosecuted The official is the first time to be the chief judge, but his historical performance proves that this young man can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a secretary assigned to him, Fran dropped all the trivialities and plunged into the file. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stacking a file with a half-manship, Fran is more shocking, Igo Andech is simply a scum of extinction, about him The case file is simply a document showing human cruelty and torture. The light is fierce and not worthy of fear. He is also a criminal genius of high intelligence. The smuggling route that established the underground guild until now cannot be traced is by his own hands. Built. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When violence and wisdom are perfectly combined, the energy generated is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not for his whim, he wants to patrol the secret industry in Feidu; if it’s not a closed city that the samurai can’t violate; if it’s not the suspect’s house It happens to be the temporary foothold of Igo, and this sinner can continue to go unpunished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This series of coincidences, Fran can only be regarded as a just saint Mutu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Never let him live, what I can choose is to end the source of this sin." Fran swears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When receiving a note from Peggy, invite him to go private at night When the salon gathered, Fran smelled a dangerous atmosphere, and he refused the invitation very favorably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the night shift, just got out of the gate, the carriage with the gorse logo was parked in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up," Peggy ordered, the dim light made Fran unable to see the expression of the lady, and the half of the face was revealed from the window. In the shadows, it is like an inanimate sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think there is anything to talk about," said Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe my intention, you have vaguely guessed, but it should be clear, no matter how you choose, what I have to do will always be done, know more There is always a benefit. I buried my head in the sand like an ostrich. I thought I could avoid the danger when I couldn’t hear it. Even the most idiotic monkey wouldn’t do it.” Peggy pushed the door and made a gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Missy said is the same as Fran’s intuition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every wealthy family will master some underground forces to do things that cannot be done in broad daylight. Treat some with bloody and sinful wrists Difficulties, sometimes more effective than the politics on the bright side. The Reinschmann family is quite influential in the dark world, and the name of one of the fosterers is both Igo Andech."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible. The evidence of his crime is conclusive. Even the illiterate can impose the death penalty. Moreover, the public is paying attention to this case and can't play falsely." Fran advised himself to endure, he tried Peggy who persuaded to regard virtue as a toy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also the reason why I tried to hand over Andre to the Royal Court of Constantine. The Metropolitans did not have much interest in the case, and the court was The kite made by Reinschmann’s family seems to be high, and the owner’s thread can make it in any direction.” Peggy sneered, “In fact, it’s too ideal to save Anderson from the death penalty. Although boring, it is always comfortable to whitewash. In the Royal Court, the outcome is still a death sentence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the point?"<br />< </br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> This is much easier than the fee, and the Reinschmann family has a strong glory, but it does not shine the light to every corner of every city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fran looked at the carriage, "Please stop." He asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be so stubborn, I am giving you the opportunity, the man is always looking forward to the head, Imagine, Baron Fran Fryer, louder than the name of the jazz More."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long silence, Fran smiled tiredly, and the smile seemed to make the 27-year-old younger ten years old, "Please Don't play with me anymore, Ms. Bananas are delicious, and monkeys have the right to choose whether to eat or not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fo Lan just took the carriage, Peggy shouted Living with him, "It’s very strange. In the past, you didn’t like it anymore. I will always agree. I will remind you that many things have been my personal greetings before, but this time, I am conveying the will of Reinschmann, you understand me. Meaning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Differently, in the past, the big dog's dog biting the dog's activities, no matter where the penalty is, and the bones are all just eating the fair dog." Fran vented, "You have enough in this world." More, at least, I have to leave something insignificant to prove the immortal things between heaven and earth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the streetlight, the prosecutor’s thin back is dragging Long, Peggy groaned with irritability, and she suddenly remembered the pot of dog meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the opportunity will no longer be given to monkeys who don’t know how to be good. she thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of the trial, the topic of the people is all this law and In the evil showdown, four hundred hearings were packed, and more places were not available. They could only be crowded in front of the courtroom, crowded crowds, noisy noises, and people felt that the wide squares seemed to become narrow overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the early morning, the square was leaking. In order to get closer to the gate, the citizens would rather stand for four hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be sympathetic to the public, the court specially set up a errand in the square. These screaming couriers with amazing vitality will from time to time put the scenes in the courtroom Dialogue, loudly portrayed to the citizens who have no chance of witnessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At about ten o'clock, I am looking forward to the already-successful version of the opera, which is finally going to be staged. The announcer, no, the courier shouted. "The trial is about to begin. The chief judge, the judge and the lawyer have all entered the scene. The justice is our undefeated Saint-Fran, and there are lawyers who will defend the villains. These things that fall into the eyes of the money are simply unconscionable." He knows everyone's preferences, and spares no effort to praise the prosecutor, but as much as possible to humiliate everything related to the prisoner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, no conscience! No conscience!" everyone joins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you are on the execution ground, it is the real carnival. Everyone said, is it a good gallows or a guillotine?"<br /><br />&nbsp People immediately divided into two factions, agreeing with the gallows to say that this can give the criminals pain, and the satisfaction of the guillotine rebuttal that only the red color of blood is the shirt of justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disagreement quickly merged into a will, "Give him death!" This shouting is deafening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hour was solemnly ringing, the trial began, and for a moment, the entire square was silent, and people fell into serious silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, the perfect opening speech, St. Fran enumerated forty-nine crimes, all of which were shocking, and the lawyer could hardly refute." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give him death! Give him death!" Seriously swept away, the screams of enthusiasm resounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courier ran out of the court again and held up his fists. "The prosecution began to call witnesses and gave the devil Andre a fatal blow." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of hands learn to lift up and wave their fists joyfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the witness changed the confession! God, what happened?" Another messenger hurried into the crowd, he jumped into the fountain and cried "But don't worry, St. Fran can handle it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first everyone didn't care about this little change, but the bad news came out one by one. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The prosecution has successively called seven witnesses, each of whom betrayed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The lawyer began to attack, and he claimed that all the allegations in the court were unreasonable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Day, the documents provided by the court actually have missing pages, and thus An allegation was overturned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible, even the chief judge is betrayed, the lawyer showed the account of Fran Flair, damn, The account deposited 300,000 gold coins on the day before the trial. He sold justice! He sold us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial has been going on for three hours. People have been desperate, and the riots of near riots spread in the solemn Mutu Square in the first court. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of people began to attack the courts, to maintain the security patrols and court guards, to cut off all efforts to evacuate the public, do not know who first started, bloodshed happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the investigation, two citizens were killed in the push and hundreds of people were injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party of the carnival became a sacrifice for the tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtroom was boiling like a splash of hot oil, and the judge shouted quietly and could not stop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I propose that this trial will be suspended indefinitely, and the prisoner will be handed over to the Royal Court for trial on the day of the trial." The prosecutor on behalf of the Justice of Tantin Said, "Everything that happened today is ridiculous. Suddenly changed confessions, missing key pages of the case and the 300,000 unidentified property, all the judicial colleagues in the country will wait for the first fee. The court made a reasonable explanation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;瘫The Count of Carmen sitting at the VIP hearing, I don’t know if I feel shame or anger, my fingers are deeply immersed in the leather sofa. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is unable to stop the Royal Court’s proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know someone is guilty." Carmen thought, but the idea of ​​tracing was quickly cleared from his mind, and Lord Earl had to give priority to preserving his own reputation. position. "There must be someone responsible for this." He turned his eyes to Fran Fryer, who had solidified on the bench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran closed his eyes, his body and his senses were numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of the first witness change, he understood that he had fallen into the trap that was already ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, from the night when he and Peggy completely broke, he estimated what would happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a mortal after all, there is no invincible supernatural power, no good eloquence, no sentence can be pronounced without evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although everyone knows that Igo Andech is indeed guilty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a reasonable and ridiculous aspect of the judicial process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept thinking,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What evil did I commit? With a broken noble, With the identity of a small prosecutor, you must reluctantly fight against authority."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I know that I can bow my head, my good future can beckoning to me, why do I pretend to be a saint, and I think I am losing everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Martyrs? It is not good to use the power of others wisely to maintain relative justice without prejudice to their own interests?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it until A thought appears in the thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Born can't decide, it's the destiny of destiny; death is inevitable, that is the promise we made when we were born. Since fate will everything Arranged, people can only make the most limited choices, I just chose, my own ending."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, not manipulated by anyone, Freely, I chose the ending."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he figured it out, it was easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hybrid villain smiled smugly, the gorse is really a good master, buy threatening key figures, collude the bank to add a few zeros to an account, Arrange a few thugs in the crowd of the square and everything is solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he can continue to return to the bloody world as long as he can endure for a few months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecutor who looked at the lost soul, "Stupid bird." He sneered silently, then followed the guard, and the prisoner in the backyard prepared to send him Wang Dutan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Anderson, I am sorry." No one expected that Fran, who had been standing still, shouted Igo, in full view. Apologize to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Igo knows some of the grievances of this prosecutor and Miss Big Sparrow, is he wanting to forgive in this way? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s late," Igo said scornfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s late, I’m deeply disturbed by the damage you have suffered.” Fran’s face showed a mocking smile. “Not at the beginning. You should be placed in a multi-person prison. Those who have been detained for many years and can't see a woman are inevitably a little perverted. I mean, you know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
