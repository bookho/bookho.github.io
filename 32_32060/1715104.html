			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The interior of Heiswan Castle is one of the most tasteful luxury symbols in the Golden Horn Bay area. Antiques, oil paintings, sculptures, the finest wool fabrics and the most expensive Silk, of course, there is music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a new hired by Wang Hao, to give away the idle pianist, Doyle Gray is the most popular among the ladies in the castle. He has a Zhang Jun Qiao's face, long silk-like hair scattered behind his shoulders, blue eyes sensitive and tender, fingers long and powerful, in front of anyone is instrumental, likable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful man is a cadre of the shadow organization, deliberately staying with Peggy, responsible for security and liaising with Joe Coleon at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this fact is only known to a very small number of people, and the maids of the castle regard him as a charming and elegant artist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one month, Doyle has already got into bed with a few beautiful girls, and there is a rosy wine in the pores of the beer hall. There is a maid, Tess, who is in her thirties and has a serious face, but she is a woman who is in a bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I know it is not right, but Daoer can’t help it. He is a hobbyist, a playboy who seduce a woman and is a dragon. Before, it was because of the collusion of a Marquise, the affair of the incident, and almost the violent Marquis secretly cut his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more dangerous the woman, the more he has a soft spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Byron’s storage, his nominal owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sees the woman’s eyes very poisonous, and thinks that Wang Hao is definitely a stunner worthy of capture, and a beautiful woman who seems to be very lonely, obviously accepts A man like him, enjoys comfort in bed. However, due to the orders of the leader, he did not dare to take action. He could only imagine the connection and imagined a girl under him as Peggy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The leader of Corleone is too cautious and fearful, isn't it a girl? A woman is a woman after all, even if she is too cold and majestic." He thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, you can get Wang Hao’s favor. It is really beneficial to himself. It is even possible that he can get the full support and replace the status of the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the appearance of another man made him feel uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casimodo·Bao Knight honors the Earl of the Palace, a violent and ugly man who is unconventional, ugly and sullen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s ridiculous. Peggy also sees this kind of person as a smart and capable military strategist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light From this point, we can be clear that Doyle Gray is just a smug idiot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the future, you will listen to all the instructions of the Lord of the Knights, and you must not be mistaken." Peggy told him that Doyle believed that the so-called military division should be like him. Elegant and handsome, like an artist, he is trying to calculate the intrigues and tricks of dark aesthetics, and let the enemy die without a place of burial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brain may be full of muscles and big men? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes him uneasy is. Out of a playboy's understanding of women's psychology. He obviously felt that when Wang Hao and the Knights talked, the tone should be more intimate. When discussing things with others, Peggy is always sitting in danger. Calm and cold, fully in line with the performance of an elegant lady, but when she stayed with the guy, she was very different. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time when Doyle saw Wang Hao and Bo Knight alone drinking afternoon tea and sipping freshly brewed coffee to discuss their views on jurisprudence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy squatted halfway at the table, **footed, the button under the collar was untied two, revealing a large white chest . Indecently laughed loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't agree with you, only monkeys think so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Oh, my Highness, I don't approve of your thoughts. Can I see you as a mother monkey?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really bold and unremarkable." That said, Peggy did not feel a little unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This fucking is like flirting!" Doyle thought indignantly, "dog men and women!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a woman sees a man as a close friend or family member, she will behave so casually, which is not related to love. It is a dangerous signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn't figure out why he was alive and dead. Why did Wang Hao care for such a ugly and inhuman man? He was always indifferent to his beautiful man. If he was not a contact person, he would not be eligible for the Black Swan Castle. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dora, who was deeply frustrated, felt that he had to take some action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛丽安 is Peggy’s personal maid and one of the catches of Doyle Gray. The girl has a soft, fluffy blonde hair. Well, especially the waist, as thin as a grip, at the moment she is kneeling on the ground, using a bristle brush to clean the dirt on the corridor carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pair of powerful arms suddenly embraced her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heaven... Hey, is Mr. Grayie you?" Lilian was soft, her cheeks flushed, and she fell in the arms of the man, biting each other. Her ears, in such a warm and charming voice, said, "Hey, baby, can you help me a little?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I listen to everything." Yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cassimodo Berkshire, don't you think he hates it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Bo Knight? There was an ugly face in her mind, and her hostess valued the person very much. She couldn’t talk about hate or appreciation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlock the button's wrap rate and shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want him to be driven out of the castle." Doyle said the soft things in his palm, hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you have any tricks to rectify him? Your lord is the crone of the master, who has the right to have money, and you are just a singer." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness can shelter him, but can't block everyone's mouth, you are at night..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You are a jerk, let me go to bed with him, and then deliberately found by others, frame him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛丽安眯眼, said dissatisfied, But it will destroy my reputation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to come to the real. At that time, you only need to call for help." I will be the first to rush in." Doyle replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of aristocratic forced maid's romantic affairs is not a big deal, but Julian is a person around Wang Hao, although a servant, his identity is smaller than ordinary The lady of the aristocratic family is more honorable, and the current situation is very sensitive. If there is a bad news from the man, Peggy wants to avoid being suspected of being debauchery, her husband’s life and death is unclear, and the suspicion of rushing and sticking together is only Can let the other party roll out of the castle for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the other party leaves the eyes of the store, outside the wilderness, it is not uncommon for a murder to make a fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if this man is a provocative martial artist who knows the potion adventure, he is an ordinary person. He is a mysterious dragon, and some methods are to put a mortal to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Doyle wants to fire. When she wants to drag Julian into the room, the girl cleverly breaks away from his arms. "Fast two o'clock, the master still waiting for me to serve? Next time."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn. Every time this girl is in a critical moment, she will use her reasons to avoid it." Doyle glared at his own bloody stuff, thinking with anger, he thought about going to Roanna, or Tess. Or self-reading to vent the fire of the lower body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran met in the corridor and Doyle, he shouted at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The internal rebellion of the Shadow King organization has not subsided?" Fran frowned. "As the leader, Mr. Corleone is too disregarded by the overall situation." At the moment, you can't focus on a woman and an old man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————— —————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”Hello, you are not aware of the threat of the other party, Miss Ann Corleone is the most... ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he has nothing to gain until now, even the other person’s whereabouts have not been found." Fran said sternly, "Let him bring everyone together." Go back to the castle and hide it. Wait for the instructions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang Hao authorized the Knights to control the overall situation. Doyle has no reason to object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the back of the ugly man, the beautiful man vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran knew that the cadres of this dragon organization were very dissatisfied with themselves, but he did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a beast will not take the dog’s provocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just relaxed a little, at least An Mei will not be blocked by siege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since she is looking for the Shadow King in an attempt to retaliate, then she will bring Coleon around and wait for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a small puzzle in Fran’s heart. "How did she get together with Zolfa Ronchi? I and the man, still It’s really awkward.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inconvenience of the foreign minister is the same as the day and night of the royal family In the house, Fran Fryer lived in a villa near the main house of Hei Swan Castle. On two floors, the environment is equally luxurious, and all kinds of luxury items are dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night has just shrouded the world, and after Fran-Freier finished eating, he handled several documents at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has just come into contact with the tip of the iceberg family, and he can’t help himself. This family ability that has been passed down for hundreds of years is amazing, from politics and business. The military, to those with supernatural powers, exerts a dignified influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My goal is not only the Missy. I have to destroy this cruel family that caused me misfortune, they are." Fran's nephew has a burning fire. "Even if you follow the law, the crimes behind the scenes are heavier, destroying her, and destroying them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He locked the instrument into the drawer, going downstairs When I came to the bath room, the large silver bathtub was filled with hot water and steam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot water bath is a good way to eliminate boredom and fatigue, and Fran’s eyes are on his eyes, and the thoughts in his mind are gradually subsiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how long it took, when the hot hot water gradually became warmer, he was keenly aware of some slight movements: the key inserted into the keyhole, the door opening, the footsteps...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young girl dressed in a black and purple lace-breasted maid costume sneaked in like a chinchilla, screaming in the water, "Hey." She went into the bathroom, closed the door, and was interested I looked at the body of the man in the bath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there something?" Fran stared at her, the girl named Julian Sivagna, a portable maid trusted by Peggy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Night, man and woman, what do you think will happen?" The girl shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran’s lips flashed a smile, as if she understood her intentions, “then?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Then, of course, is to have some fun." 黛丽安耷 pulled down the eyelids, biting her lips, licking the ceramic mosaic on the floor, the appearance is pure and hooked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really a man." The girl started to solve Your own buckle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When are you ready to call rape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛丽安瞪大眼, stop learning The move of broadband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going out!" Fran snorted in disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You guessed my thoughts." The girl smiled and said, "If I also shout?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, people are always willing to believe in the weak, hey, how strong you are, I am just a weak woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I am being yours What is it? It’s Mr. Doyle Gray’s let you come. He seems to hate me.” Fran stood up from the bathtub, took the dry towel, wiped the water, and dressed in a change of clothes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who can make you and Doyle go." Julian leaned against the wall, messing up her hair and tearing the sleeves of her clothes apart. Looking at Fran, he came over to himself. Then he slammed the lining down to reveal the slender and beautiful, leaving only the body of the small underwear, on the left side of the chest, embroidered with a small pale red mandala flower tattoo, under the lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran and her passed by and opened the door of the bath room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save..." The girl was just about to call out loud, and wanted to exchange her feelings with the new secretary of the store. With the followers of the Great Supreme Castle, it was estimated that Doyle Gray, who had just arrived at the door of the villa, got the signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound came to an abrupt end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a group of stunned people standing outside the bathroom, all of whom are clerk and clerical officers accompanying the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, Fran summoned them to deal with some cumbersome copywriting work, and had been busy in the studio on the second floor for hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than 300 people inside and outside the castle. This temporary personnel transfer did not attract anyone's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil servants heard Fran’s loud screaming in the bathroom and thought that something was going on, so they rushed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick carpet of the room and the stairs covered the footsteps, so that Julian had a large group of listeners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All conversations are for their ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You won." Yan Lian pouted. Put the clothes back on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran looked at the girl’s expression without nervousness. Suddenly smiled, he did not know how to be a good clerk, and got to the ear of Julian. "I am wondering, according to the personality and preferences of His Royal Highness, how can a woman with a brainless flower be served around? She knows everything? Please convey your Highness, I have no time to play this boring childish game to her. Look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This works 16k novel network exclusive text version of the first release, without permission can not be reproduced, excerpts, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy leaned back in the chair, put down the book at hand, and listened to the report of Julian’s grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guy deliberately teased me, he already knew the little tricks of Doyle Gray."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl said that the generation of the Sivania family is the sacred gorse, lurking in the dark, participating in the master's tactics. Serve and protect each generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of boring naive trick is also worthy of Grey." Peggy smiled. "The shadow king's subordinates are all stupid." What about the goods?" She looked at her loyal maid. "Well, I finally have a reason to give you to Quasimodo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I will serve him as well as the owner." Lilian lowered her head and lifted the skirt to salute the coffin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who behaves re-loyal. Peggy will not fully trust in the bottom of her heart, but it will only lead to resentment by slamming one eyeliner to the Bo Knight. Missy will not do this kind of stupidity that drags down her loyalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you put your eyeliner, you have to let the other side have nothing to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, Casimodo is very pure-minded. You can do anything, but don't seduce him to bed..." Peggy said, but it seems I felt that I was too cautious and stopped my mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛丽安 picked up her eyebrows as if she had heard something other than words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, Doyle Gray was secretly driven out of the Black Swan Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let Joe Coleone send a decent person, not a monkey playing tricks."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy asked Julian to pass on to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My nephew, my baby." The beautiful man shouted angrily. "The leader will anger to cut my finger, you help me to my highness." Ask for sympathy, at least give a reason to say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, my Daoer, why should I help the monkeys?" Julian said femininely. There was a sneer in the eyelids. "And, my master is now the Knight of the Knights, and that should not be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Doyle Wake up, this girl did not like herself from beginning to end, they are all loaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The severe blows and sorrows of self-respect have caused Doyle to lose his senses, forgetting to attack the servants of His Royal Highness, and will bring himself a murderous murder. Even the leader of Corleone can't keep him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s delicate hand grabbed his neck and lifted the man like a chicken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dauer is unbelievable, this bed in his eyes, the height of his hand, Jane is unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to use his dragon ability: the magic player, in just a few seconds, he can play a melody of auditory hallucinations in nothingness . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bones were twisted and violently rubbed, and Daoer’s pain could not be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I now represent the will of the lady, attacking me, it is equivalent to tarnishing the honor of the gorse family, you can die." Julian still smiles Whispered, "However, the Dragon Mairs are really bad. If you can't use super powers, close combat is like a child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She threw the man on the ground, wiped her hand, and kicked Dow's throat with her foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the era of wildness, Master, Saint Samurai, Druid, Warlock, countless supernatural genres appear in the world, with the passage of time and the civilization In the recent generations, except for the Austrian law that has been lingering, the magical power that has lost its power, the rest are annihilated in the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone studies occultism, they will find that there is a genre that does not rely on any spells, but with the special exercise of **, there is a great power between the fists. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This genre is said to have originated in the far east, so it has a polar Eastern style: monk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most loyal servant of Peggy, the singer of Sylvania’s family, has received this exercise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This girl is too arrogant with my favor, as a punishment, I will give her to you as a servant, you can dispose of it at will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
