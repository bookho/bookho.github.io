			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new district of Feidu, countless extraordinarily tall buildings spread along the broad boulevards paved by white stone, lined with magic crystals. The long pillars are covered with streets and lanes. Every night, soft light is emitted, expelling the bleakness of the night. The skeletons are carved by the engraving masters. In the daytime, they are also decorated with street crafts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every intersection is built into a small square with a gorgeous fountain, and the jumping water shows the wealth and vitality of Feidu all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most famous is the Mutu Fountain in front of the main aristocratic court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue of Mutu, who is high in number, stands quietly on the bronze pedestal in the middle of the circular pool, and raises his hand high, holding a short sword symbolizing judgment. The other hand hangs on the chest side, holding the scales that represent justice. Thirty-two jets of water ejected and leaped to form a mist-like water curtain, making this stone giant more sacred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gothic architecture behind him is a pair of long-gun-like spires that stretch out into the sky, as if to smash the morning glow of the sky. The majestic architecture and solemn statues, as well as the guards on the square with black cloaks on the armor, make everything in front of them seem solemn and rigorous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first court has always been a solemn and rigorous place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistant Prosecutor Fran Fryer is full of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the law enforcement agencies with the highest fees, standing in a wide courtroom, under the watchful eyes of the big man, sinners who are not worthy of forgiveness are inexhaustible The bottom of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn’t this exactly what he has been pursuing? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climb the 30th-level long-term, and pass the pass to the value guard for review, Fran walked into the door of the long arch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ends of the arch are engraved with embossed figures of the same size, all wearing a judge's robes, or a holy smile, or a pair of eyes and a pity Or glare, it seems to never compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are pioneers and builders of law in the history of mankind, who laid the foundations of the law and represent the history and traditions of the Code. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the stone tablet, engraved with a line, "It is not sweet, but suffering, he is not facing bureaucrats and members of parliament, nor is it to make Everyone becomes a brother. You must be careful to act according to the law, do things according to the law, swear by honor, and be faithful to justice, and never slacken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fee The swearing-in of the first chief court chief is also a vow and advice to the latecomers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you walked through the arch and came to the vestibule, the giant clock on the tower just sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slamming bell echoed in the air, the long and bright vibrations three times, each vibration brought a long echo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first voice represents sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second voice represents the verdict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third voice represents never forgiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the long-standing tradition of the First Court, and it officially begins on behalf of the new day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beginning." Fran said, "My new stage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several The blink of an eye passed on Monday. From morning to night, Fran checked the testimony and looked for details of the patrol team that did not investigate the situation. In the mind, the scene of the defense and the defender was simulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Fran, who worked alone, the complexity of his work made him feel the pressure he had never experienced in the Seventh Street Court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He completed three trials and put two murderers and one counterfeiter into prison, but it was not enough, and the desk was still full of files. , what type has it. The robbers, scammers, and black-hearted businessmen seem to reveal the sly smiles that only he can see through the instruments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discerning person can see that the five prosecutors are divided into three camps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading the way is Peggy, the glory and power of the Reinschmann family, so that the big men can take care of her. She can even let the police station of the Wangdu Security Office pay for the suspects of a certain case. The officials put down the work at hand and used resources to run for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the trial, she often gorgeously accused the accused of committing all the crimes of the crime, and displayed it in front of everyone, in detail as if she was the accused's accomplice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four times, after the speech of Peggy, the defense lawyer lost the courage to continue the defense and turned to persuade the parties sitting in the dock to plead guilty. Reduce the penalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Ayr trio has also achieved great results, and the division of labor of the three people makes the progress of each case very amazing. Although Al himself is not prominent in any aspect, his organizational ability is the root of the tacit understanding of this group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first court, efficiency is always worth paying attention to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatigue made Fran’s cravings multiplied several times, and the small office assigned to him was often filled with a smoky smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan ignited another cigarette, and the fire of the stars exudes a smoke screen, which is clear and dark in a room that is not bright. This is Anmei bought tobacco leaves and cigarette paper for him, the price is much cheaper, but the feeling of sucking is not inferior to the high-end goods of the tobacco store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lovely girl, while complaining about smoking and bad breath, don’t kiss her, and willingly roll the cigarette to midnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For every bite, Fran feels the taste of the little wild cat's fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to have a brighter future for a brighter room with a small balcony, I must work harder for this girl."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is tired of wanting to leave everything, and when he sleeps for ten days and a half, he always encourages himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he regained his spirit and struggled with the lawyers in court and the sinister suspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, his first court, Hall 21, has more and more audiences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran's style is obviously more interesting than other prosecutors' step-by-step trials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always talks about topics that seem to have nothing to do with the case, provokes lawyers to keep protesting, the audience can’t help laughing, and The judge screamed at the hammer and silenced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now everyone will find that those seemingly ridiculous stories, as the case progresses, become a wonderful weapon for guilty sins, and cannot be denied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, in a futures fraud case, the prosecution had no evidence at all, but the probation period was getting closer and closer, and the trial had to be rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant is a sturdy monopoly who has always claimed that his expedition has discovered a gem mine on the faraway black continent, with the most impeccable and impeccable agate . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Peter's fleet will bring back the agate full of warehouses, enough for the ladies in the city to blame their own jewelry is not precious, but the old Germany wants to hire miners, sailors, and maintain ships. Who can spend a small sum of money on it and share the wealth with old Peter in a few months.” Peter claimed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a little bit of money coming into the sea and flowing into his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month has passed, half a year has passed, and one year has passed. The full-boat warehouse agate he promised would never appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few aristocrats among the deceived people who jointly took the liar to court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no evidence to prove that a businessman is lying, even if he has a gem mine on the Black Continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter whether the plaintiff or the first court, there is no time, and there is no intention to take a sum of money to go to the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove a few of the royal seals in the name of the king, the Black continent is poor and only the slaves will travel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only valuable ones, only the wild orc tribes, the primitive human subspecies, have once established a great empire, but a hundred years ago, they were The human kingdom is destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong orcs, enchanting foxes, these are the only wealth on the barren continent, and they are very competent as tools or playthings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan slowly tells the story, how the sailors who took the slave ship fought with the orcs, and the primitive tribes on the prairie even ate people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his remarks, the audience has come to mind, the scorched earth under the raging sun, the bloodthirsty savages are everywhere, every piece seems safe. The place is hidden from the deadly danger; every dwarf shrub lurks the beast's claws and blood red eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Mr. Peter, please tell us how your great adventure team defeated the orcs and even snatched a richly produced vein; Your heroic fleet is how to send the goods to the fleet under the harassment of the indigenous people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer of the businessman stood up, "Judge, I The party is a wealthy businessman. His guards are well-equipped and well-trained. Even the veterans who have been through the battlefield are just like this. The prosecutor has also described it," said the lawyer, who intended to pause, seems to be laughing at it. Fran was caught by him. "The Black Continents are a group of bloodthirsty primitives. Ten orcs with wooden sticks are also no match for a soldier who is armed with a sword."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A hundred years ago, human soldiers destroyed the empire of the primitive people; a hundred years later, the private guards can defeat them, human beings are always the most proud race in the sun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer is famous in the circle, the language is very agitated He provoked the audience a sense of pride as human beings, for their own won a warm applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, that is, Mr. Peter is conquering and plundering the black land, not pure trade behavior?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, whoever is mentally handicapped to do business with the orcs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Peter's private guard, really training Is it a heroic and unparalleled?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wealth of a businessman, How many mercenaries can be raised, I doubt..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His prosecutor, my client, is a very successful businessman." The lawyer interrupted Fran's words. "He even has the title of Lord Honor, and there are no problems in supporting thousands of mercenaries."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter stood proudly in the dock and nodded. He almost wanted to kiss this lovely lawyer, not only to fight the prosecutor, but also to promote his wealth and status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original, presumably those mercenaries, even if they are sent to occupy the cost is not a problem?" Fran suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The judge, the prosecutor has been making unfounded speculations, even he is unreasonably..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Get it." This time it was Fran who interrupted the lawyer. "Thousands of soldiers plundered the seal of the nobility and unreasonably snatched the veins belonging to him. This is betrayal! It is riot!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aristocratic land? I don't understand what you are talking about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you forget, A hundred years ago, the great Como I, the founder of Byron, assigned the Black Continent to his princes after he commanded the fleet to destroy the orc empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed true, but the Emperor of Como, who is the conqueror, or the princes who receive the reward, are simply regarded as the honor to show off the victory. The land covered with barbarians is not stationed. And the value of development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, the successors have almost forgotten that they still have such a barren land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Peter, are you prepared to rebel?" Fran asked in a bad manner, and the object of ridicule was sweating and uneasy. The writhing ass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is your private fleet coming from? Which territory has you captured?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After repeated questioning, Peter barely squeezed out three words from his throat. "Alexander, that is a place where even wild dogs are not willing to wander. It is not the territory of a big man."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone is fortunate enough to go to the Black Continent, they will be surprised to find that the name of Alexandria, which is loud, is no different from the fishing village. It was originally a temporary camp for the slaves. For most of the year, the coldness is like a ruin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me check it out." Fran took out a dilapidated book that seemed to be scattered into confetti when he touched it. This is the old version of the aristocratic hereditary that he turned out from the first court's data room, at least For more than 50 years of history, in the new edition, there can be no hereditary information about the Black Continent. The editors and related nobles are too lazy to put it in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, found, Alexandria, formerly known as the Cape of the Cape, this estuary with six thousand miles of land around it belongs to the three emperors of that year. The inheritance of several generations should be... oh, Mr. Peter, you are unlucky," Fran said with regret. "The Reinschmann family has had several queens and famous family members."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a gorse that is always in the infancy, and people who are a bit of a place are starting to wipe the sweat on their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I don't want to play." Fran let the defendant struggle for a while after desperation, then said, "Give you a chance, you You can find evidence to prove that your private guard, the powerful fleet, and the gem mines on the Reinschmann family territory do not exist. Dear Sir, for sin or fraud, please choose."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a fool who knows how to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he retired, the judge curiously pulled Fran and asked, "If the defendant, no, now is a prisoner, what is the other port, what should I do? As far as I know, there are places in the Black Continent called Portela."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s more funny, that lap, and the Carmen family, our total The chief of the court, there are some sources," Fran said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, when Peggy met with Fran in the corridor, he stopped and looked at him for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A person should be limited by arrogance, should a certain family be used as a prop for the victory of the lawsuit, should it be punished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Fran began to confess and did not consider it comprehensively, when he was preparing to apologize to Missy, Peggy suddenly smiled. "A meal, maybe I will forgive you. Know how to achieve with the power of the upper ranks." Purpose, but don't know how to deal with the tail, childish and interesting man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the arrival of the carnival, the citizens of Feidu are attending the dress ball After the street rushed to the cattle, there was another good place to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the First Chamber No. 21 Judgment Hall, there will often be a wonderful drama, and the judge who plays the main role will use an impeccable way to let a gangster show a desperate look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feidu people love the stars, if not, they will create one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is their choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Prosecutor Camilo privately told Fran that after the internship, his name is likely to appear on the list of prosecutors directly in the first court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night of the carnival is boiling, the noise of the noisy and joyful laughter, even the gods who sleep in the stars, will be from the eternal sleep Woke up, curiously bowed down to the world of yuwang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scarecrow party is going on. In the largest central square of the new district, more than a dozen scarecrows symbolizing evil and doom are turned into ashes in the raging fire, whenever a pile of ashes When Mars is completely extinguished, there will be a burst of cheers in the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then everyone rushed to apply straw ash on the hand and touched the person on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The custom of the Carnival of Fedor, the more the palm prints on the body, the more he will be patronized by this year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more bad luck someone has, the more fortunate they will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, the exclamations and smiles on the square are one after another. Of course, there is also a cry of a hapless egg shouting that his wallet has been touched away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran was a little regretted to watch the Scarecrow party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His new coat is gray, countless palm prints are connected, and even his face is inexplicably slap, leaving a straw Black ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei was held in his arms and protected very well, until the rushing crowd, the girl’s dress was spotless. She happily glared at Fran's neck and laughed at the poor appearance of the gray-headed brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you don't have to dress up, you can participate in the masked dance." The girl smiled forward and then raised her fingers, and the fingers smudged on the face of Fran. Point out some white vortices in the black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
