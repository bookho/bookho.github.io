"Two good ladies, why are you?" Say one, even I feel inexplicable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean me, but my mouth is very clean." Cecilia apparently She went to the kitchen first. She slid over a dish of peanut butter and shouted, "Big man, no bread, only peanut butter is not good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barry's face turned red, and she smacked a smack on the soft flesh of Nicole's waist. "Death, don't talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hey, haven't you been eaten yet?" Nicole said to her. "Did I have lived for several nights? Someone is facing a big cake all day, but he doesn't stop."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the big cake!" Barry was ashamed to face Nicole's big ass, and slap a few slaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, what happened?" Fran asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole quickly said, "The news of the troupe is very well-informed. In the past few days, I have heard people say that you are going to marry a young lady of a certain family. Who else’s daughter who is studying abroad is pulled back to Tantin by her family. Is it a great count for what count?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s nothing remarkable. "Fran took the smoke from Cecilia's hand. "Don't mess with the adult's things, children, can't take this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am already very Big!" Cecilia proudly patted her chest, um, indeed a little bigger than the flat washboard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be rumored." Fran said, "It's not too late, go to lunch together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, no such thing." Nicole said, strangely asked, "Big man, there is actually something I always wanted to know, why have you not remarried? Because you still remember the pony Tida's mother?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is great to stay in love for the lover, but people still have to pay attention to their eyes... sorry..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on Fran’s face made Nicole feel that he had made a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. Nothing, don't say this, go to the restaurant on Silver Avenue, I know that there is a fried lobster meat in the store, it tastes great." Lan took the coat in his hand and walked outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will find you." He is in the bottom of his heart, whispering to the shadow of a thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher of the ceremonial hall is teaching the students in the study room, and the walls of the room are covered with brown soft oak. On the wall of the desk's left hand, there are three fourth-order bookcases filled with beautifully booked books. The other corner is the display cabinet of mahogany, which displays many small iron boxes filled with tobacco. The high-grade tobacco produced by Byron is limited, from Malmo, the chewing tobacco with very strong taste, the favorite of Ingmar. The rough grass paper is rolled up, and the long mouth of the gold foil is wrapped in the tail...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher's voice echoes indoors. "Byron's tradition. The white hairs on the Earl's clothing show the title of the knight, must be three, can not be mistaken in formal occasions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although in the ordinary The letter of the recipient can be simple. But according to the ancient ceremony, if it is a formal and rigorous communication, you must add the other's surname. This is a practice in every country, you are a nobleman from Ingmar. I think it’s already clear.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a woman in her thirties who has a dignified lady’s face and shows meticulously from head to toe. Serious and critical. However, his students, absent-mindedly playing with a delicate lighter in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Knight of the Knights, in etiquette. You are a serious rude behavior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Today is enough..." Fran paused for a while, and he found that he did not know the name of the ceremonial teacher. "Ms. Please come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "There is a lot of attention to the ceremony, I am worried that you will be over the ceremony." The teacher was helpless, and after a little cleaning up, he left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the ceremonial teacher to close the door and open the drawer. Take out today's Tantin Morning News, the red headline on the front page, "The rebels are still at large, and the border patrols have nothing to gain." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran’s gaze was slightly stopped, and the newspaper was turned to the third edition, which contained a small news piece, "The fog covered the screen of Tantin, the authorities." Warning to be hunted lovers, be careful to enter the limestone mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have ten ways to deal with Zall Law Lonchi, even if he can return to Tantin, it doesn't matter."

A gunman leaned against the rock wall and swallowed the wine from the vial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days of trekking made them exhausted. In the mountains of danger, search for a person's trace, like a needle in a haystack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be right." Despite the cold rain that drifted in, she dyed the clothes, she kept thinking, "Zolf Lonchi could not I thought that I would be wanted, if I fled into the mountains, it would be temporary. And there is no information to show that he is a good athlete in the field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girls The fire was extinguished, and the map in the hand was checked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tirole Field Stores, an internal journal published a few years ago, has published the most secure route map of the limestone mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, security is only relative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten gang members led by Lauvita have already had two people who were injured when passing through the steep terrain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
