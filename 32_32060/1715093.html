Fran turned his attention to Lauvita: "In particular, a need for long-term medication to stabilize the spirit." For the big man of emotions, when his little secret is discovered by others, it is undoubtedly a disaster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Chujun couple are very private in the history of Feidu. Hidden, but during the honeymoon trip, they traveled through many cities, so I was able to get a list of vague entourage, including a doctor named Ti'an, but this person died not long ago and belongs to suicide. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We found that the Crown Prince had a mental illness, and his private doctor happened to end his life by himself. This is a bit embarrassing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conversation took place on the Black King. The protagonist of the conspiracy was Fran Fryer and his loyal assistant and lover, Lauvita Whiteman, who I am sitting in the copper porthole of the boat and I have afternoon tea. The most authentic oriental green tea is not the kind. Tongfa brown brick tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullan licked the tea. "Maybe, the Prince of Byron’s prince, he needs a new doctor, and his illness has led him to look in the dark. So, if you want to get close to the enemy, he can help cover up our whereabouts and purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the evening of May 2, the full moon hangs the sky, the stars twinkling, The faint cloud is like a layer of light gauze, and the night sky presents a wonderful dark purple with a pleasant temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bao Dian Street No. 77 is one of the most famous restaurants in Feidu. It is surrounded by a window wall made of pure plexiglass. And there is a wonderful thin mold that allows the customers in the restaurant to clearly see the outside, while the pedestrians crossing the road can only see their own shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All seats are plush, the walls are inlaid with lacquered brass wood, and dim light is poured from the lampstand on the wall. The waiter wore a gray-white uniform and walked gently around the aisle with a plate. It seems to have both an atmosphere and an extraordinary pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can recall, five years ago. Peggy often invites Fran to come to the restaurant to eat. Its taste is also very popular with Missy. Even for a long time, Peggy has wrapped the table at the end of the window wall as a special seat. Come and taste the delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Chuan Temple was revisited in the old place, she had used Fran in her “intimate relationship” with Feidu for various reasons. In the place where Peggy used to visit, he left his eyeliner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, the restaurant’s lobby manager encountered an uncommon thing, a stranger, apparently not a regular customer, said to him, “ If someone comes to order this table, you will tell me immediately, the contact letter box is written in the note, please don't delay," the guest said. "I have an old friend who lost my contact address. I used to like this table. Although I know the opportunity is awkward, I still try it. I hope I can meet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lobby manager felt strange and hesitated, but after listening to the explanation, he suddenly realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, he has a few large denominations in his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a high-end restaurant of a large scale, this kind of thing is not in line with the rules. "I don't say it, but who knows?" Think of the ticket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this morning, a very handsome middle-aged man walked into the restaurant and asked for the location for the owner. He wrote a note and dropped it into the appointed private mailbox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When arriving at the restaurant that night, the appointment book was presented, but two other guests, a man and a woman, came in a rather pleasing carriage and looked at it at first glance. It is a celebrity, the man is tall and handsome, his blue eyes are full of talent, like an artist. Women wear low-necked silk shirt suits and wear expensive jewels, typically nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a request from the followers to clear the scene, but the lady said before the waiter’s answer, "No, there is an atmosphere."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time the waiter thought, a big tone, actually asked the restaurant to clear the venue, drive away all the guests, only serve them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t know that these two guests do have this qualification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crown Prince and his wife are coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Fran and Lauvita are sitting at the neighboring table and taste a sumptuous meal. Both of them have been dressed, which is more than the actual age. More old and steady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They exchanged their eyes and started talking. The voice was not high or low, just to let the people next to them hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Professor Foyd?" Lauvita asked, "I have never heard of this name. Did you say that he published a book? Is it Portuguese? A writer or a poet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughter, "He is a native of your country, of course, a non-doctor's layman, very few people know that he is mentally ill The masters of the field have written ten classic books such as "Knowledge Understanding" and have a high reputation in the psychology field of Portuguese and Dutch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s a psychiatrist.” Lauvita said with amazement, “I have to say that your career is always mysterious, like a wizard.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding customers were dissatisfied with the sudden scream, and the girl smiled apologetically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she looked over the window wall, she saw that Peggy was enjoying a plate of stewed sheep eyes satisfactorily, and Julius, who had already noticed it. come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation is still going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Psychology is indeed a new medicine with complicated thresholds. You must know that in an earlier period, people were afraid of mental illness and thought it was crawled out of the abyss. The devil's control, so superstitiously treated with fire and other cruel methods, so, starting with Professor Foyd's great idea, doctors not only heal the patient's body, but also save their spirit and brain."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you should have a lot of successful experiences."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, at the hospital in Portugal, I Invented a perfect new treatment that successfully cured at least twenty patients."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, are you coming to Byron to open a private clinic? "No, I am just a tourist, and the doctor needs to relax." Fran said, put down the silver fork in his hand, "Sorry, I am going to wash it." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius is troubled by his predicament, he is carrying the back of Fran, pretending Italy looks to stand up, "I went next door to the smoking area, a cigarette." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"I don't remember that you have a big cigarette addiction," Peggy said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, nothing beats you, I am afraid of your food, and the eye of the sheep makes my stomach feel uncomfortable."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several royal guards followed, just leaving their wives’ eyes, Julius whispered to his trusted followers, "Go to the bathroom, to the one sitting next door Mr. Bit, ask for a clear contact. I am happy to meet new people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, this does not match your identity." "Nothing, I am paying Duben is a micro-service private visit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards went smoothly to a silver-gray, exquisite work card, Julius read the above words, yes In Portuguese and Dutch, he knows the language. "Ward, a professor of psychology, works at the Affiliated Hospital of the College of Medicine of Rigeira." After the business card, there is a stream of smooth Byron, the new one is written by the professor. Where are the places to stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving the restaurant, Fran told Rowetta, "Without accident, he will visit me in recent days."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Julius, he has recently been involved in an unfortunate tragedy of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrow: He murdered a person and was being tortured by moral condemnation and conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confused: Although the ghost follows the temptation to say that the doctor is going to sell his secrets, but the crown prince calmly pondered afterwards, he was too impulsive, the bad mood swings. Always in my heart, I want to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disaster: He often takes medicines that can calm his emotions. It involves an unusually complicated process of mixing. He has prescriptions, but no one can prepare them. To Tantin, the court mages and the well-known doctors may be able to successfully deploy, but they can also analyze his illness, which is not enough for his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little luck: He found a peer of Dr. Tyan, a godsend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A doctor who is just visiting and visiting the Portuguese and Dutch mental health doctors in Byron is undoubtedly a good candidate to keep secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intelligence officers of the Tandin Security Office’s sub-district office quickly transferred the entry records. There is indeed a Portuguese-born person named Ward who is a doctor. He came to Feidu with a true and undocumented visa half a week ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this came in very private circumstances, and the investigators involved were tight-lipped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius couldn’t sit still, he thought it was he who wanted to ask the doctor for help and try the “new therapy”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can be more eager to become a fully healthy good man, good husband than Julius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal bodyguard and security expert did not agree with His Royal Highness, leaving the villa without perfect protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they can only suggest but not force block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t been to Feidu, just want to have a good look. Gentlemen, please don’t treat me as an animal in a cage, but also treat the outside as a wild horror. Jungle." Julius insisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally wanted to visit alone, lest the secret of his illness be known to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously impossible. The loyal guards would rather die than the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last Crown Prince compromised, he brought two guards, which is also the core of the security of the Crown Prince during the entire honeymoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the most mysterious organization of the Tantin Security Agency: an important member of the Blood Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With the protection of two Dragon Masters, His Royal Highness should be safe and secure." The guards thought, and reluctantly obeyed the order of the Crown Prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will of the reader is irritated in the stone, and it regards the luck of Julius as his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, psychology? How long did this heresy school become popular?" The reader read insidiously, "Okay, maybe I can take advantage of this opportunity." Let the soul carrier that has been in the palm of your hand become even more into the abyss of eternal loss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
