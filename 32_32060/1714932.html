			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feidu Cathedral is a legend in architectural art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great building completely abandoned the concept of architectural rationality, and the rigid lines and thick arches were cast aside. Twelve large and elegant cylindrical towers and countless fine arches support the weight of the church. The church's forty-two chapels are all supported by sloping columns, all of which form complex wavy lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the light spires of the Twelve Towers, the statues of the saints are engraved, and they are condescending, and the majesty looks like a master overlooking the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no traces of bricks and cement on the periphery, only the reliefs that come out to the hands of famous people. The Madonna of the Virgin, the battle of angels and demons in mythology, and the scenes in the Bible story, this building is almost entirely made up of large and small handicrafts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the most extreme pursuit of visual beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The destruction of this beauty, even if it is an important beam, has to be engraved with a sly pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at the beginning of the construction, some people predicted that the church would collapse in less than ten years, but the history of 130 years has witnessed this. The existence of a miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The crown of the capital", the bishops often describe it in a recitation of hymns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the citizens of Feidu privately gave it a nickname: "Holy", because when the night is over, look at this sturdy building, always feel it Like the world's greatest tombstone, it is as awesome as a bone, full of nightmarish cruelty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norson. Philippe has lived in the sorrow of the Holy Ghost in the backyard for twenty years. He is nearly sixty years old and his wrinkles overlap. . The long-term clear water and the diet of the beans made him look as if it was thin. The hard dry beans made the enamel severely worn. When the old man opened his mouth, a sharply deformed tooth called him a monster like hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monk can only eat this kind of food, they use the hardships of life and ** to show the incomparable piety of the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The greedy bishop-like bishop, the wealth I donated, can enjoy the whole year's tenderloin and fine wine." Every time I ate, Northon pulled the beans in the dish and always had to say a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monks of the entire asylum are served by fugitives who seek asylum, and the clerics who are not accommodating are willing to do this, but the number of monks, It is often a basis for the Holy See to assess whether a regional bishop is competent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only the monk is the one who truly dedicate the soul to the Lord." The upper class of the folk and the Holy See think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shrines of many monasteries always use lottery to play the position of this fatality in half a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unlucky, you have to go to the prison for the first half of the year." The god who took the next sign, frustrated like a dead mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Bishop of Ide, Ig, wisely rushed the asylum seeker into the ascetic home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the subordinate gods, Igg is as great as the brightest stars of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Commend the bright god, bless the wisdom of the bishop, and finally get rid of this errand." They sang devoutly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norson barely chewed a few beans and pushed the plate away with indignation. He missed the sweet wine and the smooth flesh. Just think about it, the saliva Rolling on the tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beans, beans, beans, the beans that have been condemned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the ruined cabinet in the narrow room, Northen pulled out a small purse in a pile of rotten cloth, carefully counted, and was still lying alone. Five golden Caesars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, when he left his hand when donating property, he could occasionally sneak out to satisfy his appetite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A golden Caesar, can let the coachman of the church, with the mass of the weekend, the gods and the bishops stay in the chapel, take the carriage and take him out for a stroll ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lively atmosphere in the street through the car form, and then buy a bowl of hot fish chopped soup and a few skewers from the roadside stalls. The civilian snacks that used to be disdainful, will save Northen from the hell of Shimizu beans to heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But once, because of the bumps, sprinkled a few drops of soup on the carpet in the carriage, the driver calmed his face and forbidden him to eat even the soup with water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, it’s just a few drops. If the whole bowl of soup is splashed and the precious carpet is dirty, the bishop will be angry." The coach said, "You Can't you get out of the car to eat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get off the bus? God knows whether the patrol team's spies are behind, leaving the carriage is equal to the loss of protection of the right to asylum. Those red-eyed spies will look like naked women's color sticks, and they will rush to tie him to the gallows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or you can help buy some wine and meat, and send it to the church, I eat in the room." Northen asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The idea of ​​stopping this 亵du, taking a bitter monk to go shopping on the street is nothing, but sending jealous food into the sacred sanctuary. That would be taken to a trial in a religious court." The coach said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weekend is coming, the church is busy, and the chapels are full of people. The kitchen is prepared with holy water and holy cake; the gods solemnly stand on the mass stage to figure out how many believers will donate tonight; the bishop is talking to the big man in the room specially prepared for the nobles, he just promised to be a baron Daughter baptism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worship and blessing that will last for a few hours begins with the ethereal tone of the hymn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Father of heaven, may all honor your name as holy; may your kingdom come; may your will be done on the earth, as you walk in heaven. "The gods recite a cross." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Glory to the Father in heaven, may the Father forgive sinners." The believers who are kneeling on the earth join. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire church is shrouded in sacred fanaticism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norsen touched the few remaining gold coins, and he decided to go out to luxury again tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse is not far from the west side of the station. When the wind is strong, the monks often endure the smell of horse urine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Bo Pan", Noson whispered screaming, half-sounding, a squinting boy yawned out of the groom's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, old man, I can be busy for a day. What reason do you have to disturb the young people's dreams?" Baipan complained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time the bishop is not going to use the car, we can go to the street." Norson squeezed his eyes and cracked his lips. "Go. Put on the horse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berpan took a look at Northen’s waist. "The old guy who grinned, didn't slip out for two months, I still I thought you have no money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norsen took out a golden Caesar and threw it into the driver's arms. "Old Philip has nothing, just no. Lack of money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bite biting the gold coin, convinced that it is true, Berpan looked around, carefully put the money into the pocket, whispered, "old Rules, you go to the back door of the cemetery and wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noson nodded. "Remember, it must be a black cross-drawn carriage." He stressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cemetery, the tombstones are neatly lined, like the dead people, where they are silently silent. Those who are qualified to be buried here are the dignitaries who believe in the teachings of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, guys, I am more happy than you, at least I will be able to eat meatballs." When crossing the group, Northon is facing the size of the tombstone. Not the statue of the dead said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage stopped outside the iron gate of the hood, "Little Bo Pan, is that you?" Northon shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Slightly, do you want people to discover us?" The coachman replied, it was the voice of Berpan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norsen is still suspicious and not moving. He uses the moonlight to look at it with dim eyes, until he confirms that the black cross on the carriage is genuine and reliable. Hey, past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Going to the night market, I miss the bacon and fish balls there." Northen can't wait to squat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you don't drink soup and soil the car, it doesn't matter if you smoke marijuana." Bopan raised the whip impatiently, and the two horses "snapped" He snorted and pulled the car slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norsen suddenly found that something was wrong, the carpet on the floor of the carriage, the mahogany cupboard hanging from the inside, the thick cushion on the seat was very new, not the one he secretly took. Many old cars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He yelled in a panic. "Xiao Baipan, where is this car?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just parked next to the garage, the church is new. Old guy, you It’s a blessing, probably even if the bishop’s lord hasn’t touched it a few times, it’s been enjoyed by you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrol team will never pretend to be a church wagon and deceive yourself The stupid trick of the church, the black cross on the carriage can not be pretending, otherwise it is tarnishing theocracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will be stupid enough to use this method to catch a fugitive, and then to greet the blame of the Holy See anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have more heart?" Northen stunned, but the panic still couldn’t be suppressed. The feeling of the big catastrophe filled the mind, and it didn’t scatter. Not going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hunch has always been very effective. At a young age, at least twice, the ability to predict danger saved his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back." Northon said hoarsely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are crazy? Money can't be retired." Baipan was not happy, he also calculated to use the golden Caesar, to go to the night market to find a few cheap and practical Small things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norson pushed the front window of the car and leaned over to the driver's seat. "Go back." He pulled Berpan's hair and screamed. The poor driver was yelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage of the horse pulled up the scorpion, and even the scorpion jumped, the carriage swayed violently, and the axle squeaked like a broken, the entire carriage The seven bends and eight turns went forward for a long time before they slowly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Pan coughed and broke away from the car. "The bitch is raised, see I don't teach you." He coughed and chopped his face. Pig-like liver color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go back, Xiaobai Pan. Otherwise, the next morning, people will be surprised to find your dead body in the stable." Northon whispers, face A terrible smile emerged, and the eyes hooked at the driver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young driver had a chill, and the angry rushed head was poured a bucket of cold water. He only felt that the old bitter monk, for a moment It seems to be the beast of the jungle, and himself is the prey that is seen by the beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the Feudian Cathedral, it was not a good thing at the time." Bo Pan suddenly remembered this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to leave the carriage to escape, but when the bishop thinks that the car is missing in the morning, there will be any punishment that will come to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dismissal is a trivial matter, and it is very likely that it will be sent to prison. The food is not so delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and left the case, on behalf of him can no longer find a decent job, the masters of Feidu will not hire people who are not innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the driver slammed his head and climbed into the driver's seat, there was a team of patrolmen on the street. It was time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Philippike Knight, you can't go anywhere, and now arrest you with first-degree murder." It is the inspector Lyme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dog's nose is really spirited." Northen shouted, then he said to the driver, "Don't play tricks, no one dares to force the church to stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if ridiculous, the patrolmen rushed into the carriage, dragging Northon down and slamming on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"亵du, you dare to insult a monk in the Black Cross carriage!" Northen's face rose red, he kept struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspector Lyme shrugged. "Unfortunately, this is not the carriage of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp What Northen understood, he sneered, "Looking for a broken car, painted with a sacred black cross? I will tell this when I am in trial."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, how dare I do such a stupid thing." The inspector said triumphantly, the game of the cat catching the mouse made him very happy. "The daughter of the Baron Hass is being baptized in the church, in order to express gratitude. The baron is ready to send a carriage to the bishop as a gift, and has asked Bishop Ige to design the style and appearance of the carriage according to his preferences."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If the gift has not been sent, it will not belong to the property of the church. Unfortunately, if you ride this carriage a few days later, we will not dare to despise theocracy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Damn, this is a scam." Northen understood it all. He gasped and looked around for a chance to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when he was young, he couldn’t help but kill a bloody road surrounded by more than a dozen patrolmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Northen relaxed the whole person, and the smell of dry beans appeared in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, everything is free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was pulled into the prisoner, Northon turned his head and said in a pleading tone, "I will explain everything, but before that, can you help me?" Bowl of fish chop soup?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put your fingers into the silver holy grail Wet, after splashing a few drops of water on the baby's forehead, Bishop Ige crossed the head of the child's head and prayed a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord Bishop, thank you for hosting the christening ceremony for my daughter." The Baron Hasty kissed a few times on the face of the little baby girl. Then hand the daughter to the wife on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is my duty to serve every believer," Igg said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The carriage has basically been built, using the finest wood. Even on the axle, the spring that was popular in the Imperial City has been added. I have to admit that This little thing makes the whole car more comfortable and not afraid of bumps."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Lord Baron, you are too generous." Igg politely compliments, but The tone is faint, and does not seem to care about the value of the gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, his heart is so happy, a real luxury carriage, worth thousands of gold Caesar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am taking the carriage today, please forgive my offense, a little vanity, because I want to experience how to ride a black cross carriage. The taste of the bar. "The baron Hass said, "It feels so wonderful, but the horse that pulls the car is inferior and cannot show the value of the carriage and the identity of the owner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"This is nothing, God is tolerant to every believer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the two good horses of the South are sent, I can formally donate To you, no, donate to the church. Please believe that if the gift is not perfect, it will hurt the dignity of the nobility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When chatting, A god hurriedly pushed the door of the VIP room and whispered a few words in the ear of Bishop Iger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The patrolman arrested him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, a few hundred meters away from the church a street."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the right to asylum?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because he sneaked It was the baron of Lord Baron, who was outside the church. He had lost his right to asylum in accordance with the convention of the secular law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Ige frowned, He apologized to the baron, "Please forgive me, an old asylum who has lived in the church for 20 years, slipped out of the church and was caught by the patrolman. It is even more unforgivable that he actually stole that you are going to donate to the church. "The new car."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I hope the car is not damaged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know that What's crazy about the old things, is it enough?" Iger couldn't figure it out, but he quickly threw the matter behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unspeakable monk is not worthy of his attention, and he is more worried about whether the new car with a small spring will be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You see, sometimes I feel that the right to asylum is too tolerant, and some fugitives, even if they live in church for decades, still can't learn to behave." Bishop Iger was somewhat embarrassed to explain to the guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Hass also happily thought that he could help the Count of Hothouse a big deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of the carriage is also the furniture of the Piaget. If you don’t spend a penny, you can sell your personal feelings to the Earl of Hothouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
