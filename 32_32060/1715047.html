			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. "The singer of Zall's Law? It doesn't look like it." Lauvita White White fox suspicion not far away, in the dark and wet woodland The inexplicable woman, looking at the muzzle of the black hole, showed a disdainful expression, which made her smell an unusual atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is an unintentional mountain climber? But the clothes that are worn are the kind of casual home clothes, and there are no tools such as mountaineering bags. Her expression and manners, like a lady, when she was bored walking in her backyard, she finally found the fun to pass the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight fierce gang members, who put down their guns at the same time, seem relaxed, tracking the goals of the past few days, have fallen in a pool of blood, and more beautiful The girl seems to have no threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please leave." Lauvita said, "This is a personal grievance, we will not hurt the innocent."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Coleon seems to have heard very interesting words. She raised her head and used her index finger against her chin. She thought about it and said, "It’s hard to do, if someone is very kind to me. Polite speech always makes me not easy to start, hey, you at least behave savagely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Savage?" A gang member made a rough laugh. "This girl likes our violence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the gun at his waist and strode over, looking at the pretty girl’s white and slender neck and neck. The soft skin at the nest, a whistling whistle, screaming fiercely, "Be honest, believe it or not, I will drop you off the cliff and roll straight to the bottom of the mountain!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful girl moves her hand with a tumbling action, her eyes are like a crescent, her smile is bright and bright, "So rolling?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gang members sneered back and asked, "Head, how do we deal with this silly girl?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be trouble in the future, not as good as... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest, annihilated in a bubble of blood, the gunman licking the wound on his neck as if he had been cut by a sharp knife, The sizzling sound of "Shasha". He was incredibly frightened and looked at the blood erupting from his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his eye level suddenly became lower, and the things reflected in his eyes turned upside down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head, rolling a few laps over the rot leaves and moss, stuck in the gap between the vines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very good, satisfying your wishes." The pink tip of the girl appeared in the corner of the micro-opening, she just liked the food. The satisfied kitten, licking his mouth, said with a harmless expression of humans and animals, "I hope that the death method you choose for yourself can make me feel fresh."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of beast that plays the role of the top of the food chain, playing with the weak antelope, always makes her feel full of fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautita Whiteman is shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene just now goes far beyond her rational cognition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shooting of the pistol is completely ineffective and can even be seen by the naked eye. Just flew out of the bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed is inexplicably slow, and the tracks in the air are completely out of line with the rules of physics and ballistics, as if they are no longer metal. It is a flying insect with vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight subordinates, the blink of an eye, became a lifeless body. The flesh and blood of the land, people want to vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the gun and pointed at the mysterious woman who was not like human beings, shouting and shouting, "Don't come over!" Although the sound is fierce, but the pale face , exposed her inner fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, if obedient. I won’t kill you. Unless it’s completely hostile, it’s not easy to kill between the dragons. This is the law of our existence. Of course, this right to die is not for ordinary people.” Ann Corleone smiled kindly, but in the eyes of Lauvita, this woman is like an abyss demon with a beautiful skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Weita braved the cold sweat, the dragon pulse? She seems to understand that she may have encountered the King of Shadows organization that she has been looking for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try to search for the King’s intelligence on the periphery, but remember. You can’t be enemies with them, it will only cause unhelpful casualties, that group of people, Known as the Dragon Maiden, master the monsters of supernatural ability." Fran had several times to work on Lauvita. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;monster? Lauvita was saddened by the term in her head, so she concealed the wonderful changes in her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you are a monster, but me too." The girl stared at the enemy closer and closer, trying to make herself abandon her fear and keep her head cool. The palm of her glove under the glove, quietly covered a layer of green mans, then lifted the gun, pulled the trigger, but the gun rang, and told the others that the bullet was empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No bullets? But even if there is, it has no effect on me." She walked gracefully and held Lovetta's chin with her fingertips. Lifting her face, I looked at it with interest. "I am a pretty lady. I am even more reluctant to kill you. Destroy good things, it always makes people feel bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Polite girls should report their names first."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Kai...Kelly Fakia." Lauvita shook the pseudonym, and at the same time his hand touched the body of the land, and the ability to start instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life characteristics: beyond the scope of exploration... Weakness search: beyond the boundaries of exploration... unreadable... extremely strong too...warning, dangerous..." next moment, girl The left hand was firmly grasped by Ann Corleone, and the strength was great, almost letting Lauvita's wrist bone break into several pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very serious mistake, the ability is at best only the Lord of the ranks of you, should not take the initiative to attack the king of the dragons. I have friendship with the same kind, but It doesn't mean you can offend again and again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; king? Rowetta did not understand the meaning of these two words, and was pushed against the trunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anta took the other's gloves and looked at the blue scales on the arm, "Goedes' blood?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then you make me more interested." She suddenly sneaked into the girl's clothes, the cold touch, let Lauvita start a layer of goose bumps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slippery hand, squeezed the chest of Lauvita, "What are you doing!" The girl screamed and struggled, but could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
