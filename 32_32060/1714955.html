			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn Castle is a town about three hundred miles west of Feidu. The name of the castle is from the name of the castle, from the large defensive castle built by the local lord. In the war years, the refugees and the unemployed gathered near the fortress to take refuge in the castle when they were in danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord will not let the displaced people live in the castle for a long time, people near the castle, gradually formed a residential area, and businessmen, craftsmen, slowly along the road Building a house shop, over time, when peace comes, the size of the town is beginning to take shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the origin of most of Byron’s towns, the land that the aristocrats directly governed, the manor, and the city that pays taxes to the royal family, and the officials appointed by the royal family constitute Byron. The foundation of society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortress between the town and the lord is just across a wide river, because the river is salty near the sea, so the most striking sign on the town is every street. A well that draws underground fresh water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few decades ago, the lord’s castle was probably mighty, but now, the wall of the pen has been covered with moss, and the arrow built by the wood has been in disrepair. The fence door of several people is estimated to have long been rusted. Others can only enter and exit from the small side door under the iron gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles who have inherited the title have left this country place, sending people to their estates to collect taxes every year. Now it is not under the command of the king, the lord Convene the warriors and gather the knights who fought under the royal flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army can only be mastered by the state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran outside the town, has been curiously eyed, Clydesdale Hummer is tall, but under the guise of this giant, it seems to be only Thin scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the giant, obviously a small circle of clothes, making him both like a lonely tramp, like a funny clown, Fran is pulling immediately After pulling a tight collar, I decided to go to the town and immediately find a tailor's shop. If he is a man, it is difficult to buy a ready-to-wear garment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suitcase was full of money, making him not ready to transform his clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, at least a few sets of clothes must be prepared, replaced at any time, and a large suitcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town did not build the city wall. The population of 20,000 is close to some small cities. Like Feidu, on the neat stone roads, the houses on the street are almost changed into shops, business and trade. It is already this era. Theme of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some shops, you can see high-end goods such as silk and tea, but the price is much higher than the fee, but the pots and pans are The daily necessities of the class are much cheaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran through three crossroads, the closer to the center of the town, the more prosperous, next to the police station, almost the same court with the former sharing a building, Fran Looking at the statue of Mutu, which is used in front of the court, silently prayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place from the half street is the simple chapel of the town. Fran does not believe in God. When people need to be saved, where is the god? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tailor shop is on another street, from the window, you can see a beautiful sample, the style is quite fashionable, Fran pushes the door, the store Not big, the zenith is very low, and the second floor is probably the house of the boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His appearance surprised the boss who was holding the ruler with the cloth, but when he saw the clothes that were very unfit, the boss immediately realized that the sale was coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need two sets of clothes," said Fran. "Not too good, the average cloth is enough."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, what style do you need?" The boss was pleased to ask, like the figure of the person, the cloth needed is equivalent to making two sales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ordinary jackets and jackets, plus canvas pants." Fran thought, "There is a pair of shoes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is wearing long boots, and the elastic cowhide makes the boots not encounter the same clothes as the clothes, but has cracked a few mouths and is uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss used the measuring tape to measure the amount of Fulan, and calculated, "A total of forty-six silver coins are needed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;""""""""""""""""""""""""" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you hurry up?" Fran asked, he still didn't know, the Cardinals stayed here for a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With ten more silver coins, I can hire a temporary tailor to catch up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;福Lan will give the advance payment to Qing, and then ask, "Is the troupe coming to the town in the past few days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just arrived yesterday, it seems to be called a red bird. The boss said, "Turn left, after two streets, there is a hotel, they live there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Fran is a bit strange. The head of Baru has always been careful, and usually, they are building camps in the town and when they are willing to stay in the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hotel is very easy to find, the three-story building is quite prominent in the town, the name of the "golden rose" is painted on the thin iron signboard, but on the side Some of the flowers in the yard are inconsistent, not seeing flowers, but planting some beets and green onions. The caravan of the troupe is parked on the side of the wall on the right side of the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wooden door is half-masked, as if someone is humming a small song, the faint tone is passed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one to go to Dawn Fort for half a month on each market day, there is no one in the hall, although the weather is still cold, for the purpose of saving, the fireplace There was no fire in it, and ten oak tables were empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner, the head of the barui is drinking fruit wine, half a squat on the table, while pulling the glass with his fingers, while ambiguously smearing his hometown tune. It seems to be half drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, sorry for a few days late." Fran pulled a chair and sat opposite her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it’s a card...Casimodo." Barry's fascinating drunken eyes, the tongue said unclely, "You...you come ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The market day in spring is coming, why not go through the formalities?" Fran asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going to the town house to go through the formalities, apply for open space, set up a tent, have to spend time, and three days later, is the market day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't open..." Barrie laughed and ate. "The troupe wants to... it's going to be scattered." She stood up, licking the money from her small pocket, holding a golden scorpion, and carefully watching it in front of her eyes. Look, then wobbled to Fran, and put the money into his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your wages." The head of the station was unstable, and half of it was on Fulan. "Enna was dug by the big squad, and Xiandi was enough." The money didn't want to be done, Paris was ill, and the fire was so bad that the troupe couldn't keep going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small tour group that was not enough for the manpower, now there is no way It is maintained again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, big man." The red-haired Nicole just came down the stairs. "The head of the group had a drink for the morning, so I didn't listen." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is Paris?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Burn off." Can come up to help the ball, drunken woman fell heavily, the girl almost fell to the ground with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am coming, what is the number in the room?" Fran took the head of the group on his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The three rooms on the left side of the 2nd floor are all." Nicole pouted. "They really don't look like, how the head of the team took care of them, now even The handyman ran away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not blame them, be a tour actor, can you eat for a few years?" Barrie seems uncomfortable, twisting on Fran's shoulder Come and twist, "Little Nicole, you have to find a way out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's OK, big deal, I have to find a few guests in the evening, red The bird can hold on. Rest assured." Nicole said later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid." Barrie struggling to lift her body, knocking on her head, and going up the stairs, this action almost made Fran’s heart unstable. lost balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to be a real tour troupe, and one day I can perform at the opera house in the big city." She smiled bitterly, the bitterness of her mouth, like The salty sea, "is not a roving broth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After drunk, spit the truth, small people, and dreams of small people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
