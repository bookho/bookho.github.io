			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The morning mist over the sea enveloped Queens Island. The faint smog, the islands, ports, military fortresses, and moored ships, are far from obscure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the dawn of the third day, Fran arrived at the destination, he was tired, not closed for more than three days, only relying on willpower and hatred Supporting the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road, more than once, he was at the helm, standing in a confused position, and after a moment of awakening, he found that he did not deviate from the channel. It is like an invisible force helping to fix the steering wheel. But the feeling of restlessness is more and more shrouded in him. Fran feels that there are more passengers on the Black King and more ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no time for Fran to leave the cockpit and search on board, but no results. "Please come out, friend." He shouted, only the waves and the wind replied in a mocking illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, whether it’s an illusion or not, it’s true that we have the same purpose.” He said, then he felt it inside the pocket. Bullet pistol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom has not yet appeared until he approaches Queens Island. "Probably the phantom after fatigue." Fran pushed the side. He walked onto the deck and fired a signal flare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short while, another green signal flare rose to the sky and Queensport responded that he could enter Hong Kong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, sir, there are very few boats coming here." The port staff looked at Fran and went down the platform and asked, "What are you doing?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the owner of the Flying Fish, and it is time to calculate it. It should be back." Fran said, "I have made a lot of money for this cargo, deliberately come." Queens Island greets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dusty servant, the bloody eyes in his eyes, just confirms the image of a ship owner who is worried about the goods. "This is the case, I wish you good. Luck." The staff said, "You can go to the hotel to rest first, and there is only one family in Queens Island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am worried that the ship will encounter the storm, and The damn pirate.” Fran deliberately said, “If something goes wrong on the road, I will lose my blood.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff laughed. "If it's somewhere else, I can't guarantee it, but it's absolutely safe in Queens Island." He pointed to the sea. "Trade security is the most important thing in Golden Horn Bay. At least six large-scale three-wheeled warships patrol the nearby waters. There is also a prepared navy on the island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, I am more relieved." Fran patted his chest and walked toward the hotel directed by the other side. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ann Coleone came out of the shadow of the Black King ship. She sat freely in her chair and knocked her white teeth, her heart filled with strange and disorganized thoughts. A supernatural feeling seemed to whisper in her ear. "You know him."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, she found this man who had spent a day and a half on the boat and was very human. Ann Corleone is the leader of the Dragon Veins, and even the usual king-level title can not fully demonstrate the power of her body. And most importantly, Ann also has an insight that even the Prophet Masters can't match: she can sense the power of everyone from the crowd. The magic, the Austrian law and even the dragon vein. No one can hide his identity under her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this inductive power, Ann found a lot of dragons, or intimidating or tempting. Pull them to their own organizations to gain the capital of the hero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like her brother’s ability name: “shadow”, An’s ability to combine himself with defense, offense, and intelligence exploration is called “the perfect ability”: “ "Red Prosecutor". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not call the black prosecutor, more image." Brother joked, "And, what is the prosecutor, it is a group of people who think they are smart. The judicial bureaucrat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of my power, any enemy will become a red dead meat." She replied, but did not tell her brother. The usual word of the prosecutor can always lead to inexplicable thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the most qualified Dragonmaids, her abilities are terrifying and growing. "Sometimes I think, should I be in the king?" Above the level, add a layer of the title to call you." The brother smiled and said, Sen sensitively noticed. There was a wave of uneasiness in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But today, this man who traces Andrei makes her wonder. Anzang observed in the shadows for a night, and he could perceive that he had a majestic but unstable force, a faint and fixed Austrian law, and that he seemed to have a semi-awake dragon. Close to the dragon's pulse, but more exotic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more unbelievable is that men do not have heartbeats, muscles, bones, nerves, and various organs, all under the maintenance of the Holy Power, and there is no collapse, and they continue to operate happily. It is a living dead person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it’s time to get rid of this horrible monster, but Ann Corleone is bothered by the inner feelings and can’t start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gimmicks, closes her eyes, uses the blush prosecutor, firmly affixes the man, waiting for him to help him find Andre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is a hotel, it is better to say that it is a large-scale leisure center, and Queens Island is only able to provide relaxation outside the boring warehouse, dock and repair yard. local. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not how to decorate, the walls are cracked by the wet wall, but they are drinking water, chewing cans, and staying on the boat for a few months. For the sailors, a glass of wine, a fresh steak, and a few laughs from the hotel girls are all satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captains will also play a few cards in the small casino, or repair their hair and beard, in the free time of boat replenishment and simple overhaul. Let yourself radiantly hand over to the ship in the bay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran when he walked into the hotel casino, he saw Igo Andech. After a little makeup, shaving off the thick beard, the brown skin is coated with a layer of powder to make the skin look whiter. But Fran’s death could not be forgotten, the appearance of this enemy. For a moment, he blinked red, his hand reaching into the pocket, holding the gun, and a flame seemed to boil in the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But reasoning discourages the behavior of recklessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a mixed city, nor is it a wilderness. With a gunshot, the stationed guards can block the port. On this semi-militarized island, there is nowhere to hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Calm down," he murmured, pulling his hand out of his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gangster seems to have relaxed his vigilance and laughed at the gambling table and pulled a large stack of winning gambling money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are so lucky, the saying goes, don't play cards with people who have stepped on shit." A captain stood up and shrugged. "I don't play." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
