			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. At 4 o'clock in the morning, the faint fog filled the air, and the morning light was slightly exposed, and the clouded cloud was entangled in the sky. Qing, the purple-blue sky and the black-blue sea seem to have no boundaries. Looking at it from a distance, the heavens and the earth are connected in a field of vision, and the gloom is never ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an abandoned village on a remote beach, uninhabited, with a dilapidated small pier on the shoal, and a brand new, black-painted mailbox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Byron’s coffin, through a private path, avoids everyone’s eyeliner and quietly departs from Hei Swan Castle to make an unbelievable date that sounds absurd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, as long as the person shows up, he will kneel down." Shadow King Joe Corleone leads his subordinates and lurks in the deserted village. Everywhere in the favorable terrain, he is convinced that, besides the power of Anmei that exceeds the limit, Byron can have no dragons to confront his organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before you see the Crown Prince, you must not act rashly, and everything follows my instructions." Peggy touched the edge of the window with her fingers, thinking for a moment, "the other party." It’s not a fool. If he is not consciously worried, he will never do this.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Miss closed the window and leaned against the thick velvet mat of the carriage, she On the surface, he is calm and self-sufficient, but his heart is full of enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her poor and weak husband is already crazy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She recalls what happened three days ago, and everything started with a message from a soldier who died in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran’s spokesperson Sergeant Shepherd is carefully looking around, The forehead was sweating a little, and his legs were a little soft, as if the foot was not a solid marble floor, but a gunboat deck that was swaying in the waves of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was taken to a magnificent hall, filled with antiques and famous paintings in large and bright rooms, with delicate patterns embroidered on carpets and window sills. On the wall of the door is a wooden embellished jade wooden embellished with a fine glimmer of light. Gorse, the most powerful aristocrat in Byron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waves beat the reef, and the sound of countless white water splashes came from far away. He looked at the indifferent black sky outside the window, took a deep breath, and waited for the arrival of His Royal Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a sergeant who is still not a formal officer, he can get the summons of His Royal Highness Princess Wang. It’s just a dream that I can’t imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, what he brought is fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crow's mouth that warns of the disaster is usually sent to the fire frame and burned to death. Sergeant Sheffield must have the honor and loyalty of the soldiers. What he saw and heard, and the request of the despicable, was conveyed to the priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe I will be sent to jail after being told, and then secretly executed, many people who do not meet the identity. I learned the secrets that should not be known. There is such a kind of end, well, death will die, right. I can't rescue the Crown Prince from the gangsters like a knight. Then, be a good scout for good deeds, report everything that happened, as far as possible. The fate of the land is decided by the gods. "He thought tragically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid who brought him in, sent the coffee in a silver cup, and soon left, leaving only the sergeant alone. He didn't know what he should do. He didn't sit or stand. He was nervous. On the way, the captain's friend briefly told him some etiquette, but it was thrown into the clouds. After almost half an hour, the sergeant saw a beautiful woman, she only wore a very simple casual dress, long blond hair. The hair is slightly distorted, except for the exquisite but exaggerated diamond ring on the finger, and the eyebrows have their own graceful style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the sergeant with interest and went straight to the subject. "I don't know what to say, the soldier, the letter you sent me stunned. You After falling into the water, but a passing yacht rescued, but on the ship met a kidnapped my husband, Byron Chu Jun, so they were commissioned to invite me to meet?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheffield has a strange but inconspicuous sense of disobedience. Wang Hao’s performance is beyond his expectation. Rather than being astonished, she seems to have seen interesting fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly portrayed all the facts he saw, and then explained, "Please excuse me, but I have to say that this requires ridiculous danger. Stupid, if not the life of His Royal Highness is in their hands, I will not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the sergeant, Peggy interrupted his words and asked, "What is his situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world sighed in the bottom of his heart, the key question, He learned that the royal family could never be made public, but the sense of responsibility drove him to say, "His Royal Highness lived in a room that was monitored at any time, and was not abused, but..." He hesitated for a while and gritted his teeth. Answer, "The mental state of His Royal Highness is worrying. He seems to be... crazy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw Wang Hao gently pat the feet of the floor, suddenly Stopped, although the face still has no expression, but there is dangerous light in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soldier, this matter, have you mentioned it to someone else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Except for those gangsters, I only know you under the command of His Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good." Peggy's mouth burst into a cold smile. "How do I arrange you?" What? You must know that this secret must be kept safe. Although you appreciate your loyalty, I can't..." She touched her lips with her fingers and figured it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please give my reputation to death." Sheffield asked deeply. He thought sadly that as a soldier, if he was to be a king, it would not be a blessing to use death to embody loyalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death?" Peggy took a moment and laughed. "I appreciate you more. Loyalty is a character worthy of praise. Ok, because you know This secret must be left with me, so as not to leak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up and ordered, "I will let you in the name of Byron For the military attache, and promoted to the rank of captain. You must not go out before all the dust settles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless Wang Hao walked out of the hall, received the order of the commission When people came to arrange a room for the new captain, Sheffield was still in a state of embarrassment, without the sense of relaxation and the joy of promotion, all kinds of tastes entangled in the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maniac? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Julius, you coward." Peggy frowned, thinking incredibly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the soldier did not lie, the current situation is quite unfavorable to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old emperor was weak, and the research progress of the Eternal Cabinet was in a state of stagnation. She was waiting, and when the new king sat on the throne, he grasped behind the scenes. Byron’s authority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there is a big trouble, the nobles will not let a madman inherit the throne, especially the gorse and father, they have enough reason to be in the House of Lords And the Senate, proposed to change the Byron heirs. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the emperor has only one son, he has the right to inheritance, and there are many distant relatives of the Prince and the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about your own life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a little man who doesn’t like it, is mad, and spends the rest of his life in a palace that is a sanatorium? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about this scene, people are chilling from the pores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more importantly, her plan of calculating is part of her gameplay, disturbed by unexpected factors? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, she hates the feeling of being played by fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breeze before dawn kept the sea swaying, and Fran leaned on the railing, watching the thick clouds under the increasingly intense light, gradually Thinning becomes nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about the upcoming meeting, thinking about the woman, he immediately wanted to contact her with another identity, blinding her, tempting her, will be the one The net that has been spread slowly gathers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps for other women, an evil gangster who kidnapped her husband suddenly asked to see oneself, which was simply ridiculous. But Fran knows Peggy, how can he not understand it, who in this world knows better than him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent four years reading this woman, recalling her every move, approaching her with a cover of disguise, analyzing her logic of thinking, looking for her weaknesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His female enemies, in the eyes of others, are a cult of self-righteous, self-righteous, interests-oriented, but he knows that under the surface, a game is hidden heart of. Peggy's thinking has a high degree of arrogance, such as God's arrogance as a mortal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political marriage, family separation, and royal power struggle, she seems to be keen to participate, but more, she sees these as interesting and dangerous games to squander the emptiness of a long life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps even Peggy himself is not clear, she is a hungry woman, always looking for excitement, like a hegemonic urchin who seizes all toys, when Tired of being tired, impatient, and no longer nostalgic to throw away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, let's play together, you hate the broom, hate your father and brother, because they always try to block your free play, I Come to help you, I will give you an irresistible way to play."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have played the role of master, manipulated my life, and killed some of my life. Kind of things, now, it’s my turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to perform with you. When the big curtain falls and the lights go out, who will happen? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are falling from the clouds to the dusty ground, the corolla on your head is crushed, and the graceful attire tears out countless mouths. The scene must be extremely gorgeous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would kneel in front of her, touch her face, make up her ear, and say softly, "Welcome to hell."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the sky with the cold eyes, and the color of the sky was slowly changing from a dark black to a faint gray-blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peji pushed the window, she saw the boat slowly approaching the pier, then she saw a handsome and charming man wearing the workmanship The elegant gray trench coat and the blouse of the top are covered with a deep red pomegranate flower. Unlike the imaginary one, this person is not the kind of eccentric man with a measurable and temperamental temperament, but he is well-informed and has a kind of graceful manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of the Shadow King has been detected, the other party does have only one person, no ambush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it’s not a arrogant arrogance that you think you have no choice, it’s really good. As for what, I will know immediately." I stared at Fran for a while and made a gesture of asking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
