			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.William Master walked slowly between the dark aisles, not knowing where the wind came from, stirring the desperation in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether it is the royal family or the public, I want to know, the assassin who murdered His Royal Highness, is a privately crazy manner, or is instructed." Rui Roche said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you get a person's statement without me?" William frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, I am the mage of the summoning department, not good at directly exploring the spirit of the spell." Court Master said helplessly, "But this is yours." Old, I remember that you were in the court of Feidu, who was responsible for retrieving the evidence from the book in the minds of the prisoners."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torture and torture Torture is the most effective tool to lift the prisoner's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But obviously, this has no effect on a half-mad person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time killer Busta, just a hooligan who has never seen the world, when he was sent to the interrogation room filled with the torturer’s torture, the spirit is already Overwhelmed by great fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is tired in the corner, his eyes are white, his body is like a sieve, as soon as someone sees it, he screams wildly. "I didn't think about it." Killing... No rebellion..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In medicine, this mental illness that collapses due to stress takes a period of rehabilitation and can gradually recover. But the imperial in the palace, who was angry with his fiancee, was impatient and waited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court magi, Berry, at the request of the Crown Prince repeatedly, had to despise the safety of the security department, while pulling the old friend William, with his memory Read the spell to find out the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William is preparing for the spell, thinking back to what Fran had said before he came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think that this will be a political murder. Any party, in the current situation, will only play tricks in the dark. Never use murder." To destroy the marriage." He pushed the side. "The murderer, regardless of the skill of the assassination, or the way of doing things, is not professional enough but is like a temporary mixed-up, caused by mistakes."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the experience of the Golden Horn Bay, Fran knew the gangster very well, he did not think. This will be a premeditated action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will be stupid, let a crappy assassin, to murder the covenant of the imperial empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gangster who wants to make a fortune, publicly robbing with a knife, I don’t know if he has made a bad luck, or is the misfortune of Peggy, who is on the night market and will save His Royal Highness became a fat sheep that was easy to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This explanation is more credible than the so-called partisanship and political conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William slowly sang a musical note full of magic. A lame assassin who is trembling. Throw a fine powder of sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the end of the last syllable, powdered a silver wire, entangled in midair. It then merges into a mercury-like semi-liquid, which is drilled into the ear of the interrogator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of Austrian law, through the scenes, through the void, passed to the caster's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is waiting uncomfortably for the results, especially the director of the High Defoe, the pressure on these days, almost let him go crazy with the murderer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-sound, William was relieved. "No, my thoughts are too confusing, and I don't get valuable clues. Even mind reading can't observe the memory of a madman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic It is not a panacea, the mind reading is subject to many restrictions, and the object of the law must be kept spiritually complete, which is one of the premise..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gao Defo Li Director is not in the mood to listen again The mage explained that he turned around and prepared to go back to the office. Write a resignation report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, you really have to be careful!" William just left the security hall and rushed to Fulan's Fuqiu. Mind reading did not fail, but the Master found that this matter was actually related to Fran, and then concealed the facts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was commissioned by the old Bury to help the Security Agency interrogate the assassin with magic, but it made me see a surprising secret." William drank The white hot water shouted, "As you push the side, the storage has indeed suffered from innocent disasters, because the target of the assassin is you, and the Cardinals Theatre."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mage talked about the secrets he had discovered through mind reading, Fran fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gangster from Tyrolean wants to murder the head of Barry, Nicole, Lauren, and himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murderer is ready to go out, although the gang is just a small person, I don’t know who is the ambassador, but in combination with the information sent by Lauvita, Fran has already Guess who it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanity, ugly and dirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris, the younger sister who was taken care of by the whole group, has become unscrupulous. Just to take care of his own ground, dare to kill the killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the West, in the case of inheritance, I was betrayed by you, but did not care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes became cold, flowing like ghosts, cold and chilly, "But you should not, reach out to the friends I cherish."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, is there any magic, wash the crazy assassin thoroughly, and enter a false memory." After a few deep breaths, Fran calmed down and asked Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are some, but brainwashing has a very serious sequela, which will cause him to completely cerebral palsy and become a waste after the latest one year."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William is strangely saying, "What's wrong? Even though that person is indeed Personal slag, but it is too poisonous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Soon and soon will be sentenced to death, I just let him use waste before he dies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not wrong." William nodded, no book reprinted to pick up the land. Just in my heart, I feel a little weird. This kind of means seems to be a little different from the way that old friends used to do things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the specifics do not match, he can’t say it. "But this is also a good thing. Fran has a good brain, but it is a soft heart. If you want to deal with those villains, you must come hard." William thought happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
