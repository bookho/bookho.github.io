			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The cemetery gatekeeper threw the gray coat that grew to the ankle into the chair of the hut, and shook the copper pot, and the rough ale was empty. He sighed and sat down on a simple wooden bed, coughing a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, he was wearing a Chinese costume with more than a dozen buttons, stepping on calfskin boots and leading the annual salary of 20,000 Caesar. Even the rich man who lives in a millionaires will see him laughing and patted his shoulders affectionately. He will slap his ear and say, "Hey, Deborah branch, I need a loan, if you can approve it as soon as possible. I would like to pay an interest of 1% on a regular basis. Of course, this extra interest does not have to be written into the contract..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deborah will meet Enjoy life, eat and wear more than the real rich man, drink the finest red wine, take a private carriage, have a membership in several high-end clubs, the lovers around have changed a batch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But obviously the devil is yelling at him, a sly liar, using a rotten painting to make himself use 150,000 public funds, and when he is the end of the month When the bills were borrowed everywhere, the rich people who usually invited him to the luxury party were not willing to pay for even a dollar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only sold the property and filled the deficit before he escaped the jail. But this scandal made him become a sneak peek in the financial world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he could only leave the expensive price of the capital, went to a small town in the bay, and finally found a job to guard the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s ironic that ten Caesars a month, he is a higher-educated, managed bank with the largest fees, and a master who has mastered millions of funds. Now, I am now neighboring the tombstone and the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a voice coming out of the door. "Is Mr. Deborah?" This surprised him. The evening cemetery was only silent. The cockroaches of the cockroaches, and the residents of the town, will only call him "administrator" or "old man" instead of "sir." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the door. Seeing a gloomy look, a strange middle-aged man with suspicion and distrust in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Mr. Deborah, who served as the president of the Feidu Shuangying Branch?" The man said, "I am a Longchi specialist in the Department of Justice of Tantin and would like to talk to you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deborah frowned, thinking quickly in his mind, isn’t the bank still letting him go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do Metropolitan Justice Hall people come to the door? "What is it," he answered cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very interested in your experience of being deceived, I hope you can say it in detail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I don't want to mention that, please come back." Deborah knows the rights of citizens. I don't want to think back to that embarrassing experience. "Unless you have a search warrant, I can't say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you hate the liar?" Zolfa Lungi said, "No one will care about a person with a reputation for smudging, but only me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I not? hate! The liar ruined everything about him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deborah hesitated for a while, let the door open, "Please come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Light up the candle, carefully describe the whole process of the scam. Of course, Deborah specifically stated. I have always performed well. Only occasionally greed makes him make a mistake, how can people not make mistakes? This should be understood and wide. Bankers in the Gulf cannot crowd out and ignore an experienced peer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Zall is not interested in his self-defense. "Legally, the liar did not violate any of the laws, he never said painting. There are paintings, and there is no initiative to propose a transaction. All of this is voluntary and it is indeed enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The kingdom is on, can't the law protect me? Seriously?" Deborah whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have any enemies?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Deborah said that he Suddenly, I remembered that I had tried to please the famous Gorse family. I made a false account and framed a person, but it is said that the unfortunate prosecutor has already died, and the dead can not come to revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That swindler, eyes and hair are black?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes!" Deborah shot his thigh hatefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zolf took a portrait from the box, that was the order in the west. "Look, is it him?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deborah looked at the candlelight and looked at it seriously. Then yelled, "It's him, this person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The clues came up in disarray." Zall said, "Feidu liar, It is the same person as the crow who once pretended to be the prosecutor of the Western Circuit Court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up, "Thank you for your message."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, good sir, look, can you help me and find a job in the bank?" Deborah said urgently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zall Law did not answer and went straight out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help him? Not to mention whether he has this ability, even if there is, he does not need to help one, and then no value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next goal is Miss Darmak's Baroness. I want to figure out what she used to do and why the crow will help her win the legacy." "Damn, I thought it was an opportunity." Deborah whispered, he closed the door in frustration and walked to the stove at the corner of the house, facing the hustle and bustle. In the jar on the stove, sprinkle a few leaves and stir with a spoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the vegetable soup was boiled, there was another knock on the door. Deborah thought that the commissioner had turned back and immediately ran to open the door. "Oh, sir, what have you forgotten? I have to say, as long as you help me a little, return..." He stopped his mouth, a very beautiful girl outside the door, the gray scorpion under the glasses . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the investment manager of the Fawja Investment Firm, you are De Fula President?" The girl said with a smile, "It seems that someone has visited You?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investor? And call him the president! Deborah felt his heart jump out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You graduated from the finance department of a prestigious university and have many years of business experience. Although, there have been unfaithful things happening to you.” The investment manager looked at the other person’s expression and continued, “But the business has taken a fancy to yours. Ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, there are always people who appreciate me in the world!" Deborah excitedly expected her to go on, but the girl turned around, "just now Who is coming to visit you? Sorry, according to the rules of the firm, the resume of the employee, and the experience of other contacts with the peers, we must be clear that this is a trade secret of the Bank."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deborah began to hate the special commissioner, and he couldn’t help anything. It has hindered the great opportunity to fall from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, that person is not an employee of the investment office, but a one from the Justice Department of Tantin, a small investigator, I can swear, not myself. What is wrong, but to provide clues in conjunction with the official."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then please re-describe it again." The girl took out the pen and recorded "Who is that person? What do you want to know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more The latest and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lilla Berry. The reporter of the Tantin Street newspaper has a small amount of capital and has only been in the business for less than half a year."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy waved and asked Fran to sit down and hit the newspaper on the table with his fingers. "This "Government Tunnel Project Shady" report is sensational, are you not going to sue? The Justice Court will also be "Exotic Lord Service."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I was in Ingmar, I heard that Byron was an open-minded country. And a small report is nothing." Fran said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very big." Peggy shrugged strangely. "But getting foreign government workers to get government projects does cause dissatisfaction with Byron’s consortium. Have you ever thought about joining your nationality?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byron recognizes dual citizenship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But According to the law, you must have a residence period of more than five years in Byron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Special talents are not restricted. I can invite you in the name of the Justice Department, such as a legal visiting consultant." The intention of Peggy is very obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will consider this carefully." Fran answered. He looked at his watch and said, "My company has a job fair in the afternoon and has already had an appointment with the job seeker."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I hope you find useful people instead of stupid monkeys." Missy smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Fran left, she thought about her head and shouted to the secretary. "Take me a message to the Moore Director of the Cultural Affairs Bureau. I think the news. The scale can't be too indulgent, such as the Tantin Street newspaper, a bad example."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the Boss Building."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will notify you before Wednesday if we are hired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, you are not suitable Supervisor manager position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran today stayed at No. 64, Liujin Street, and received 14 job seekers. Recruitment has lasted for three days, and the salary promised by the Bo Knights Construction Bank has made many experienced senior engineers feel excited, which makes him successfully find suitable candidates in several major positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still a group of people waiting to see in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squinted and rested on the couch, thinking that the lovitta in the bay had not yet passed the new whereabouts of Zall Law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he heard the argument outside the manager’s room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The morning face is over. And you are not on the list." Fran hired on the first day, responsible for copywriting and assisting the recruitment of Bellamy My wife is shouting loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was slammed open, and Fran saw the chunky Mrs. Bellamy eagerly sweaty, she complained, "Boss, The lady has to see you, but she does not have her on the list."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not looking for a job." The screaming angrily, "I am here to ask for justice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
