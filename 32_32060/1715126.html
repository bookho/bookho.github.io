He spoke in a breath. With a disgusting tone, "If you have anything to comfort your lover, please let me know, although I can't guarantee that he can understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After getting permission, Missy went to the side of the man in the Japanese yen. She knelt down, sneered at her husband, and reached out and tried to pat his face to check that his reason remained. a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius is like a frightened beast, slamming a mouth, licking Peggy’s back and biting it, biting it, if not Hand fast, almost torn a large piece of flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, you crazy dog!" Missy groaned angrily, rubbing her hand, she was still smashed by the teeth, leaving a blood mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;瞧, his eyes are stuck in the cheekbones, his eyes are congested, his face is screaming, his face is covered with gloomy gray, squatting It has no difference with rotten meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mad dog?" The kidnapper slammed the fire and said, "Hey, your heart is really cold, you actually call your husband, even if He is a madman, but you have made a sacred vow at the wedding ceremony, and it is necessary to take care of him for a lifetime, to death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Peggy, this marriage is nothing more than a fragile thin-ceramic pottery, the stepping step for her climbing, not the belt The trouble of shame is not a stumbling block that drags her forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more Missy is thinking, the more anger is difficult. She secretly made up her mind that the enemy would be sent to the cemetery, and the garbage had to be thrown into the rancid garbage dump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is going to use the tricks that she used in the inheritance lawsuit in the West, and once again, let the King of the Dragon who can manipulate the dead body control the Zhu Liles, who issued a royal order, transferred the rights of Prince Cooper von Tverville to his own hands. And to call the world, at the current emergency, Wang Chuan represented the royal family and took the post of the government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, arrange a gorgeous funeral for him. The reason is very simple. During the period of being kidnapped, Chu Jun has been seriously injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have to have a child. Time is very urgent, she is ready, waiting for the big man Casimo to return from Portugal, immediately start a period of four times a day, occasionally five times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the initiative can be caught in one's own palm, and Julius is dead, more useful than continuing to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy has two faces of devil and angel, the loyalty she admires, will spare no effort to maintain and grace; We. It is only used as a fertilizer to nourish her flower of Gaoling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...佩佩......佩姬?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fertilizer is gasping. The erratic sight, slowly focusing on Missy, seems to clear the picture of Peggy. The chaotic brain seems to have recovered a moment of clarity from the nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly screamed, snarled with a slurred voice, and his voice was bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick...Flee away..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Freire surprised With Julius, the dose of the potion is quite heavy enough to make the hardest person become violent and barbaric, and to extinguish the sensible light of man, but even in such a situation, he can still get rid of the drug imprisonment. . Identifying the woman she cherishes, she is desperately warning her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What an amazing soul, what a poor man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Going to the ground... hell, directed at me... I am coming, don't pull the woman... pull in..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madman cursed, struggling, trying to keep his thin body between Peggy and the gunman, he can only use this move to protect his wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chain is so tight. Zhu Lier was smothered, blood was gradually infiltrating the clothes, and dripping on the ground, he still ignored it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran’s presence seemed to reveal the scene of being killed by Igoand in the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are condemned, it is only the old man and the weak woman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I have to praise my compassion and arrange for your family to meet again in hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Peggy, he has reason to retaliate with the right to revenge, but at the same time, he also Played a cruel and despicable role, just as others have tortured him, let a man, a husband, suffer a painful collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a mirror that can be printed, who is the most ugly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius couldn’t hide his wet face and make a loud and painful sob. "Please... please... please don't pull in... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miserable mourning, reverberating in the cave, the desperate cry almost knocked down Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the trial I am looking forward to? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What reason do I have to pass on hate to innocent people? Drag the good people into the endless abyss? Let him feel the sorrow I have encountered? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, distinguished lady, look at your husband's petition, please repent for the past crimes, like the sinners in the judgment seat, humbly repent, Swearing for atonement, as long as I did, I let him go." Fran was like a drunken drunkard, unable to stabilize the balance, stumbled and walked a few steps, he bit his knees, smashing the muscles of the gang, and said hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the words were clear, Fran regretted it again. Why should we be so weak, we should continue to carry out the performance without hesitation, completely expose the woman’s ugliness and annihilate her. Now, he ruined all the plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is not weak, nor indecisive." He thought, "This is only because my soul is still an individual."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s lucky, or unfortunately continue to extend. Peggy, like a most talented actor, said the lines that Franben expected in the script she didn’t know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a hatred with you? It turns out that your goal is really me." Missy said with a smirk. "It's a pity that there are so many people who hate me. I can't even remember, when and where." You, but the dead will not find me any more trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you care about his life and death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let a future emperor, with you buried, presumably your honor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Want to kill me, this understands, But he is really full of enthusiasm for you." Fran whispered, feeling a rush to the heart, "Look at everything he did for you, listen to his pleading, have you cold-blooded to this point?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't ask him to love me, and I don't need to respond to love that I didn't expect." Peggy sneered. "He's this kind of waste. It only makes you feel sick!" "She was so strange that the head of the kidnapper suddenly became a bit lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tianci good opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl turned back to the beautiful, and raised her fingers, ruthlessly ordering, "Do it, let them die!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little maid stepped on a rhythmic pace, like a big, healthy cat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large group of crows flew from the treetops. The edge of the jungle of the black scorpion echoed with a hoarse hoarse, and the small cadre of the Shadow King, Huen Vigoga, withdrew the invisible spiritual eye. In the organization, his nickname is "Hound", which is benefited from the excellence of Huon. Tracking ability, he just used his talent to project the spiritual branding in the underground cavern and analyze the turning and ending points of each road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The position of His Royal Highness and Miss Lilian has been confirmed. I have also found a short-distance road that takes only a quarter of an hour to arrive quickly. There is no guard along the way." Huon said. He wiped the forehead and finely sweated, secretly mocking the limitations of ordinary people in IQ, thinking that a labyrinth of tunnels. Can you stop the pace of their tracking? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the kidnappers are miscalculated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the planned plan, the four Dragon Mairs are preparing to enter the cave, quietly lurking to the vicinity, unexpectedly launching the offensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That must be a one-sided slaughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hovering in the air, the lazy beggar who refused to return to the nest, became more and more noisy and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huen stopped and looked back in confusion, and suddenly he felt something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not stimulated, the crow won’t be so bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The far end of the line of sight. There seems to be a faint green light that flashes in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in the eyes of the fearful, the "hound" Huen's skull flew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The momentum is kicking, the curve is well-proportioned, the wind is brought up Press, cut your face like a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan crossed his arms in front of his head, slamming his legs, and his arm bones seemed to be hit by a hammer. He was so painful that he rolled over and shot the gun, but he didn't have time to aim at the target. The girl's waist seemed to be soft without a bone. He twisted his body back in the air and went straight into his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Shock!” Julian’s palms clung to his chest, giving off a faint light, and suddenly, an extremely powerful force, like a frenzy The airflow flew Fran and slammed into a stout stalagmite ten meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hang", the stone fragments are flying, the dust is rising, the stalagmites are broken into several pieces, and the man is buried underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshots, the gunmen have pulled the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little maid is agilely flying through the stones, the bullets follow her figure, sparks on the stones, but they can't shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius suddenly screamed hoarsely, his legs slammed, and an unstoppable gunman crashed into the lake, even crawling and crawling Run towards Peggy's shelter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunman turned his gun and prepared to kill the captives who escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn." Julian worried that the hostess was accidentally injured by a stray bullet and rushed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince was stumbled by the chain and closed his eyes desperately. He couldn’t get up and could only close his eyes and die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't shoot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the millennium, someone shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛丽安杏眼 round, incredulously looking up from the pile of stones to stand up the scorpion head, except for the clothes on the chest, as carefully cut There is a crack in the shape of the palm, but the person is intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This man is not an ordinary person." The girl was wary, her shocking fist, even if the other party wearing a strong steel armor, can directly penetrate the body into the body, Crushing organs and bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She guessed what the other side must have hidden, and dared not act rashly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the two sides were silent, waiting for what they were waiting for, and the caves except the sound of breathing between them, only the haze of the giant side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Huen Vigoga? Actually, I haven’t arrived yet. If I just joined Julian, I will be able to get rid of it.” Peggy thought quickly. "The people of the movie king are more and more unreliable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s almost time for the appointment, and the drow law should have brought the prince’s army to this place. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franan thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only joy is Julius, the prince of Chu Jun moved and walked slowly to his wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I... safe!" He sighed with relief, shaking his still unconscious head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy glanced at him coldly and put his hand in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius misunderstood the look of his wife, becoming shy and cozy, stuttering and comforting, "Don’t be embarrassed, I Clearly, it is to confuse the gangsters. How can you kill me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dirty face, the remnant of the potion, made the muscles weird and twisted, the mouth cracked, and the saliva flowed down the lips. Let Julius still be a funny monster, a madman, and he wants to tell the bitter, reunited joy of the parting, but the stiff tongue can't spit out the smooth and sweet words, he is so anxious that he is sweaty. . Just holding Peggy, holding her into the arms, feeling the warmth of his wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy raised her head and pointed her nose at him. She suddenly asked, "Do you love me?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When, of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much love?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am even willing to die for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lady smiled and laughed like a flower, she said softly, "It seems to be earlier, after all, It’s more troublesome to take the body on the road. But you really make me feel sick.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took out the silver ladies single-handed pistol and shot the bullet into his heart . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please remember, this is just murder. A felony in the law." Peggy stared at her husband's incredible fear, "So, don't say it. Like giving me a favor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius coughed with blood, released his hand, and took a few steps, tragically Sobbing, "No, this is not true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not willing to believe that death, the true death, but the person he most trusts to admire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light suddenly went out. The deep darkness regained the entire hall, as if there were countless ghosts floating in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You finally arrived? Can't let Chu Jun die." Fran's voice, "grab him back."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish." An Mei’s voice, "But we have to leave quickly. Even me, I can’t retire in the army of nearly a thousand people."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oops!" Julian felt a bitter chill, and Wu Hao’s keen instinct made her believe that an extremely dangerous person appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe there is a battle. But she has to give priority to the safety of the hostess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t explain much, grabbed Peggy’s hand and fled to a cave on the left side of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the remote end of the tunnel, looming intensive gunshots, and the shouts of soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Lian Anan, how far is it to go out?" Peggy asked hoarsely, the boundless black tide made people feel suffocated, she liked nothing The head flies, turning around between the narrow ramps, I don’t know how many hours passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still looking." The little maid replied, "There must be another exit here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, there is no Julius's body, the shadow king's corpse is not useful, and I can't get a reasonable and reasonable order." Peggy pulled the hair irritably. "Although I can make another arrangement, but in Politically, I lost my first-hand power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did Lilian just want to say, suddenly holding her breath, "have footsteps."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the swaying light of the torch lighted the cold tunnel, and a team of firearms search teams in red and white uniforms appeared in front of them and saw some people raising their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Peggy von Como?" The search team’s officers stepped forward and asked, the official sign on his shoulder, indicating that he was a Major. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly." Peggy secretly glared at the target of the other search, but it was himself, but soon relieved, estimated to leak the wind, let Prince Tver The intelligence network found the whereabouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the prince is not a stupid generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nothing, even if the prince found the corpse of Chu Jun in the cave, he could not push the charge on her head in order to attack the gorse family. evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I received a secret message. There may be a stronghold of the kidnappers here. I want to check it out personally. The cave is too deep and too wide. I have not found any clues. You It’s really a big help to get there in time.” Peggy, with the appearance of a husband’s death, asked, “I will remember your merits. Now, lead the way, I have to meet with the Prince of Cooper, Prince Vonville.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
