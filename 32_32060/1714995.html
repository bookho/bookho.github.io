			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Through the middle of the Golden Horn Bay and went deep into the mainland along the river for two days, it reached the Port of Shubo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the nearest port of Byron to the Portuguese-speaking kingdom. It is a commercial city like Feidu. The difference is that she is responsible for the inland except for shipping. business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glass capital deterred those perfect glass products, or the finest wool from Winston, the authentic taste of Russian wine, from the other end of the river, Or a large number of carriages are transported from the dry road, crossing the borders and flowing into Byron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 7:00 in the morning, a beautiful sailboat slowly sailed into the VIP pier of Aka City, the black hull sparkled in the sun, the pier The receptionist recognized the ship, the Black King. In the past six months, the ship had traveled to and from the city of Aka at least. He greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small berth at the VIP terminal, with a monthly rent of five hundred sesame, the people who can use it are not rich and expensive. The receptionist remembered that the owner of the Black King was a handsome aristocratic gentleman, and everyone called him Master Van Graham. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has an industry in the most prosperous part of Weber Harbour, but he did not hire a housekeeper and occasionally stayed for a while. People speculate that this heroic person wants to invest in real estate. As long as there is no war, no plague, the house with a value of 150,000 Caesar is now worth at least 200,000 in a few years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any news from Igo Andech?" Fran handed the receptionist ten tips and asked him to find a carriage. When the other side walked away, Fran asked Lauvita, the girl's ability to be outstanding, good at analyzing intelligence from the clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's so easy to find, Andrei can't be such a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Lauvita answered, "The people on the underworld will always leave a few trails for themselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we will find, he is the end There is something hidden behind." Fran knocked his hand on the ground, "As long as he dares to show up, he will definitely not run."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lou Wei The tower was surprised at the sudden anger of the head. She shifted the topic, “Why come to Weber Port?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I ordered the goods should arrive." Fran let the mood calm down, "deteriorating the best glass instruments."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ravens are loaded with a lot of Experimental materials purchased from Feidu. Fran has always wanted to find out what a wonderful book with a lot of plants is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran built a darkroom in the modern home of Weber, transforming it into a laboratory, and after a month or two, he will come to Weber for more than half of the research. In a week, relying on graphics to speculate on the meaning of orc text, but progress is always unsatisfactory. A lot of expensive instruments and materials have been scrapped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Fran chose the lab here, ordering glassware, nowhere else is more convenient than Weber Harbour. General measuring cylinders, cymbals, and horn bends can be purchased directly. If the shape is more complicated, it can usually be sent from the deterrent within one month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kregan has stood firm in the Golden Bay, and he blatantly annexed Andre’s unspoken smuggling channels, in fact not only He is doing this alone, and almost all the powerful amnesty has begun to act." Lauvita thought about it and portrayed it. "A group of hungry wolves. In the same kind of flesh and blood that have not yet swallowed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The party who is hostile to Andy, did not respond?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. Usually the triumphant side will be anxious to receive the power of the loser. But the current situation is weird."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have other purposes, don't care about it. Let Kregan try to get in touch with the round table council, the big gang of the underground world. If he can get the seats involved, it is more for us. Help.” Fran took out a piece of broken tobacco from the bag and carefully smoothed the paper and said that it was rolled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new good for Fran, and only smokes his own cigarettes. The wind in the port was a bit large, and the Fulan rolled up the smoke, looking at the shape of a concave drum, and sighed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, no wild cats will roll. How can I learn from her methods? Fran thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Weita chuckled, her face swayed into a small dimple, she took the cigarette bag, evenly poured the leaf on the paper, slowly took the paper Rolled into a slender shape, "It's not difficult, just a little patience." Lauvita put the cigarette holder over and handed it to Fran. "Hey. It's very simple."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran looked at the girl's finger, and a little black and yellow smoke was stained on the elliptical nail. He was a little embarrassed. A long time ago, the person he loved was like this. With a cigarette, he grumbled and complained. "You only have one day." I have to smoke 7 cigarettes. The lungs are broken, I don't want you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I only smoke seven cigarettes a day." Fran Zhang Open your lips and say in your heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to you?" Lauvita asked, coming over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, the car is coming." Fran looked out of the dock and walked over to the carriage. "I don't want to smoke now." He pushed the girl's hand away. Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage stopped at 30th Street, Knights Street. Fran’s house is a two-storey villa with a vestibule and a back garden. The former owner is The baron is in a hurry to move, so the offer is very reasonable. Fran simply bought the large furniture that was not easily transported by the Baron, such as table cabinets and sofas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivy vines are covered with white stone walls and green fences. There is a beautiful small fountain on the left side of the iron gate, and various colors of rose in the back garden. This season is booming, pure white, pink, lemon yellow, flourishing and fragrant. Because no one cares, the breeding of weeds is a little more, masking the gravel road from the iron gate to the door of the building, it seems a little unpopular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran only hired a janitor to manage the courtyard and mailbox while he was away, when the janitor was coming out of the hut at the iron gate. Said, "Mrs. Grandma, are you going to live for a few days this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the situation, Gunther." Fran shouted his name, "First Go to the hotel restaurant for three days and be at the window. Also, this lady is my assistant at work, not my wife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry. "The gatekeeper Gunther said that he was a little confused. He used to call it before. The master did not explain it like today." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautita bit his lower lip and pretended not to care, and smiled at Gunther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What news is there in the city recently?" Fran turned the mailbox, mostly advertising advertisements for various shops, and several new magazines. Sample publication. These magazines specialize in the evaluation of luxury goods, and most of the readers are wealthy people in the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no big news." Gunther said, "Some little things must be ignored by the master.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yes, I heard that there is a famous theater company. I was invited to perform in the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have time to enjoy the drama." Fran shrugged his shoulders. "Well, you go back these days." I will inform you before I leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon at the hotel After dinner, Fran returned to the house. "I went to the lab. What arrangements do you have?" he asked Lauvita. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to the bank first, the bond you bought should be sold. Then I went shopping." Lauvita said, "Maybe watching the drama, not Say there is a famous troupe coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, at night, you go directly to the hotel restaurant, I will go at that hour." Fran wanted I thought, continue, "In fact, you don't have to follow me to Weber Port. It's quite boring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing, even if I am at Feidu, I usually do it. Just take a vacation.” Lauvita smiled and said, “Let's go busy.” The girl turned and found that her eyes were dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is a secret room, it is very spacious, and the four corners are adorned with a bright magic crystal lamp. Fran closes the door, takes off his clothes, and changes his body shape back to the card. The appearance of Simono. Whenever there is no one, he will do this, so that the ring can replenish energy and reduce the consumption of the Holy Power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change into a large dress, he sat down, continued to read the book, relying on the incomprehensible combination of patterns in the book, the mineral powder to be purchased, The spar and the herbs are heated and then twisted and the glass valve on the soft leather tube is twisted to allow the acidic liquid medium to slowly drip into the crucible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than forty experiments, he has mastered the approximate recipe, according to the last description in the book - the figure is a loud scream Orc - Fran believes this is a stimulant that can temporarily increase strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master William once mentioned the potion of the orc shaman, the deepest potion, and even the dragon scales that are invulnerable, the back stretches The wings that can fly freely can only collapse the thick wall by virtue of strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is looking for a self-protection ability at least as far as possible without relying on the Holy Power. There are many supernatural human beings in this world. He witnessed the wizard William, the bishop of the sewer, and the "daughter" of the saint warrior Matilda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Difficult security Deshi, the gorse family, there is also such a person's help, he must master the way to deal with them. "There was no way to escape before. Now the situation has settled down. I have already asked people to look for the traces of Matilda. She can probably help me in this regard." Fran side mixed with the potion and considered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no clock in the room, and some are just a precise calculation of the stopwatch to the second. Time is very fast for Fran, who is addicted to the experiment. Of course, the secret room does not have windows leading to the outdoors. He did not realize that the sky was completely dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The color is the same as in the book, the sticky blush." ​​Fran is very happy that it seems to be successful today, he first verified the poison with the test medium. Hesitated, tried to take a sip and taste like salt water. Waiting for a long time, but no effect, Fran can not feel, after drinking the stimulant, the muscle should have a sense of expansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is it wrong?" He frowned and rubbed the tips on the book again. He could grasp the clues from the pictures. And maybe the more critical place is in the text. "Where should I go from, to find someone who knows the orc language? Do you have to run the Black Continent, no, it takes too much time, now I can't have time." Fran is very annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautita opened the door and she carried a box of meals. Until 8 o'clock in the evening, the head has not yet gone to the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s time to do the experiment and forget the hour." The girl thought, she went up the second floor, walked into Fran’s bedroom, and put the lunch box on the bedside table. on. The secret room is behind the bookshelf. At this time, the bookshelf is still sideways, revealing the hidden door on the back wall, indicating that Fran has not come out yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was just about to shout, but found that the door was slightly open with a small slit, the head of the experiment, those strange materials made the girl always very curious. "Hey, I only take a look at what the experiments are all about." Lauvita thinks that it is rare to forget to close the door, she is not willing to give up the opportunity to satisfy curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
