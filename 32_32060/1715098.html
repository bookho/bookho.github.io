			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The darkness shrouded the sea, the thick clouds made the sky drop so close at hand, Sheriff Sheriff was cold and his hands and feet were slow. Slowly stroke, try to let the body float, desperately drifting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a soldier stationed in the Queens Island Navy Fleet, nearly 30 years old, his red hair is wet and close to his face, the set of uniforms And the long boots are quite attractive to the girls, but at the moment, they are as heavy as the lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fleet has recently sent a large number of search teams to detect all the islands where Tibetans can be found in the sea, but the ocean is too big and aimless, apparently nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be in the side dish of the military camp mortuary, find a large piece of meat." Some people so ridiculous, attracted a burst of laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheffield is a member of the search team. They have just traveled 260 nautical miles west along Golden Horn Bay and explored four ridiculous rocky islands. At 9 o'clock in the evening, the sergeant still thought about getting a good night's sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial completion of the mission made everyone on board relax, so they drank some wine, and almost half of the people who lived at sea during the year would The bottom of the bilge is prepared for sake to prevent marisis: long-term cold water and moisture with wind, causing joint pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sergeant is a very light drinker, and when he gets up in the middle of the night to check the equipment of the ship, his head is still faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheffield walked onto the springboard, holding a windproof horselight, and slid into the reins of the small rowing boat to see if they were still strong. Alcohol caused a slow feeling, told him not to maintain the balance, lost his hand and turned down the railing, fell into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold water made the sergeant fully awake, and a small wave rolled him away, and when he coughed again, he was already out of the boat. More than one hundred yards away. Sheffield yelled, but the wind blew away the words. The driver who was driving the shelter apparently did not hear the sound of someone falling into the water. The ship kept the speed and went further and further. Gradually disappeared into the dense darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good seaman has been strictly trained. If it is offshore, he can swim in the air and get out of danger. But now, the surrounding is full of endless, pan With the chaotic dark blue water, the sea is kind. It has nurtured countless lives; the sea is cruel, and it never let go of any wrecked drowning person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Persevere, maybe soon my colleagues found out that I am not on board, they will search on the ship first, and then return along the channel, it may take half an hour, maybe an hour." The sergeant looked forward to it, but until He was numb and his calf began to cramp gently. Did not wait for the rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of nature can easily swallow small humans. Cold, undercurrents and turbulent waves are the help of the god of death. Sheffield’s desire for life can only delay the death of the waves. More and more footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his lips were blue and his consciousness gradually became stunned, he saw the light, the passing ship! The sergeant struggled weakly and shouted desperately, then his eyes blackened and sank to the bottom of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Frey slowly moved down from the bed, the gray-eyed girl was squatting, the beautiful face left with a faint that had not subsided, slow and steady Breathing. The corner of the mouth is solidified with a faint smile, and it is swimming in the country of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t sleep, so he put on his coat and pushed open the floor-to-ceiling glass door leading to the balcony of the main shelter, standing in the gleam of the stars, watching the night The smog is on the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black king floated quietly on the water, and as the waves swayed gently, in order to avoid falling into the naval search network, Fran commanded the ship to shuttle through the sea. . Playing with hide-and-seek games with warships, occasionally borrowing from a private path to offshore supplies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the small land of Fran, but he feels that this ship is an island, floating in the unknown world of fog, he plays with Means, forcing the enemy to advance toward the end of revenge, but not for the slightest joy, because what he did was sinful, black-hearted, and betrayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has no choice, no retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has made up his mind to reach out from the cracks of hell, grab the feet of the enemy, and drag them from the bustling and arrogant world. Fire and sulphur in the abyss, biting each other, sinking into each other, night and loneliness are always embarrassing, bringing an unforgettable chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at the night sky dotted with a few lonely stars, examining his heart, looking for a few rays of light, as a comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't make sense, but people always love to do something that doesn't make sense." Fran wondered, he trembled a little, wondering if the sea breeze was too cold, or because of the growing darkness in the soul, in his ear. Whispering and whispering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan was addicted again, so he touched his pocket, took out the cigarette from the cigarette case, rubbed it under the nose for a while, then picked it up, thinking The ignited, blown wind always caused the flame of the lighter to sway and extinguish, and he frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beautiful hand stretched out from behind, covered in the fist he had gripped, took the cigarette, and put it back into the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You take less, it's not good for the lungs." Lauvita said in a whisper, the girl's pale yellow hair was a little messy, wonderful The body was wrapped in a thin nightgown, with bare feet, slight light and darker shadows, giving her cheeks a magical glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wake you up?" Fran said apologetically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was awakened." Lauvita tapped the silk cuffs on her wrists, sideways, leaning against the fence on the balcony of the suite, "if There is only one person left in the bed, I will wake up immediately, it is difficult to tell the feeling, in the illusion of half-sleeping and awakening, suddenly thought it is important, things that can not let go have disappeared, it is really scary I want to cry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita is a woman who works hard, the grayness she has encountered in the past, and her experience in the gang, let her stay away from this moment. The man around me no longer believes in anyone, and because of this, she has an extremely strong obsession and monopoly for Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan turned his gaze to Scorpio, and the girl stopped talking. For a time, only the wind and the sound of the waves were left in the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time, Lauvita broke the silence gently. "I listen to my big breasts, no, Miss Barry said, have you ever married?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very abrupt problem, so that Fran stopped for a while before answering, "Yeah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of person is your wife..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran did not notice the subtle difference in the words, Lauvita did not say "death wife ", but "wife", although the two words are not much different in the semantics of this sentence. He did not know that Lauvita had been very suspicious of one thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran’s mind shows the playful smile of the little wild cat, she always likes to hold her nose. Slightly squinting at the head, the happy and bright expression will always expel the haze of life, even in the most difficult period, she has many people lacking, from the heart of the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this image has been replaced by bloody murder, she has been transformed into a cruel and ruthless assassin in the underground world, which makes Fran no longer beat the heart, pumping Tightly packed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destiny gave him a big joke. He revenge for himself, for the innocent family to recover justice, when he went to hell, he only wanted to see the enemy's face in horror and fear, instead of facing his wife, the kind woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fist was pinched tightly and said to Lauvita in a serious and affirmative tone. "She is a good woman. Although she has not passed through gorgeous clothes." I have never worn a valuable jewel, but in my heart, she is always the most holy woman in the sun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grey-eyed girl squatting beside Fran . Hands around him on the floor, "Do you still love her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; did not wait for Fran to answer, and said slightly, "Hey, you still It’s a cruel man, actually telling the lover, 'My wife is the best woman.'”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She squats, her head tilted, kisses The man's lips are bitten with pointed white teeth. I used a little force, and I was afraid of getting hurt to him, so I switched to squatting and sucking hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran surprisingly strokes the girl's hair, slowly responding to her warmth, gently touching her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, maybe it’s been a matter of ten minutes, but both of them think it’s just a moment of fingering, which is so wonderful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head. Let’s go back to the room." Lauvita panted and her eyes waved. She took Fran’s hand and walked toward the bedroom. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man stopped and looked back at the dark blue sea in confusion. "What sound did you hear?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl thought that he was saying that he had just been gently and charmingly, and he smiled flatterly. "It will be louder after a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Fran Put your fingers in front of your lips and listen carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transformation of the Holy Spirit, although his senses do not have supernatural ability, but also far more acute than ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did hear the call of doping in the night wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the sound, Fran looked at the sea two hundred yards from the boat, and there was a small black shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rowing boat was put down, and the two gunmen quickly swept away to the drowning person, and the other party was lucky enough not to sink to the bottom of the sea. He was transported back to the Black King, lying flat on the deck and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a sea corp. There should be a large army of troops in the vicinity, we have to change the channel.” Lauvita did not look at the man’s uniform. This guy broke her wonderful date on the bed, "and there is no reason to save a soldier who is hunting us." His subordinates threw him back to the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let him stay, I also consider sending someone to send a return fee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "信信?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since it is a kidnapper, he has to make his own request, and he can just bring my message to the proud store." Lan answered, he ordered the gunman to send the sea soldiers to the guest. Entertain in the most polite way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheffield was gently awake, just blinking, the zenith beautiful silver frame painting came into view, "What about me?" He groaned and licked his sore neck, only to find himself lying in bed, a man in a sailor suit looking at himself in a condescending position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;falling into the water...lights...vocals...the rowing boat for rescue...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not a nightmare , is the fact that happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant took a nap and remembered the experience of last night. He jumped out of bed in a panic and wanted to express gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you wake up, breakfast is on the table." The man pointed to the bedside table, and the silver tray was filled with a strong savory steak and honey. Golden bread, and black caviar as a seasoning and a cup of coffee, "I will come back in a quarter of an hour, the head wants to see you, Mr. Sergeant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Why do they know that I am a Navy soldier?” Sheffield thought, and soon relieved, there was a sign on the cuff of his uniform that symbolized the rank of the Byron Navy sergeant. The scent of the dish made him hungry and could not help but bury his head. stand up. He also curiously noticed that the silver plate and the handle of the fork were all hot with a small purple emblem, a crow that unfolded the wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furnishings and decor of the room are exquisite, and the sergeant is not the kind of knowledgeable person who can appreciate the value. He dreams like a dream. "Is it a rich man's boat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheffield saw her wearing a silk robe. So he looked around and his sea uniforms were scalded and neatly hung on the hangers in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former sailor had changed the door after the old minute, and the sergeant had changed his clothes, preparing for grateful words, waiting for the benefactor’s interview. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed the man out of the lower deck and passed through the spacious aisle. Walking along the yellow wooden steps toward the main suite, they circled a small circle on the deck, the sky was already bright, and they looked out from the window of the ship. The sun shone through the mottled clouds and shone on the sparkling water. Last night, the sea was still like a The cruel and ruthless trap, now, is as gentle as a girl's Yan Rong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most beautiful ship that Sheffield has seen. The deck is clean and bright. The straight hanging rod, the big sail is full of wind, and the sea is broken lightly. Leaving the white waves, the speed is very fast, like the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several sturdy sailors caught the attention of the sergeant. According to the sense of the soldiers, he could smell the scent from them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a sailor who runs a sea boat, but a warrior who has experienced a fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but guess the true identity of the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner is a handsome young man, with a classic look like a statue, black hair and nails clean and neat, wearing a black pullover, dressed like a gentle scholar. But the eyes are slightly gloomy, like a flaming fire, the look on the face is serious and firm, and the lips are tight and aggressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat on the recliner on the back side of the window, just avoiding the infiltrated sunlight, and saw the guests coming in, the master squeezed half of the smoke. Put it into the blue crystal ashtray on the hand side stool. Standing up and smiling, "I am very happy to see you healthy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s voice is low and friendly, with a soft exotic accent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheffield pinched the sailor cap in her hand and touched her hair nervously. "I am Sergeant Sheriff of the Queens Island Third Fleet, right. Your life-saving grace is deeply grateful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, unless there is no mercy of the devil, everyone should lend a helping hand to the victims." The owner did not follow the etiquette and answered his own name. He pointed to the sofa on one side. "Please sit down, my sergeant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner’s conversation Very elegant, skillfully guiding the sergeant, soon, Sheffield laid down the sternness of the heart like a bath, they talked about some of the most popular topics, the owner also curiously asked about the life of the military camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant saw a woman wearing glasses, very beautiful, came in and whispered a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that my medicine is still not effective enough, his illness has worsened." The master touched his chin and thought about it, and told him, "I will The ingredients of the medicinal ingredients are adjusted, hoping to make him sleep well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a patient on the boat, but the owner did not take the initiative to say that Sheffield did not I am very interested to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, the host invited him to lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheffield was amazed to find that the dishes were full of flavor and taste first-class. He suspected that he was not on the sea boat, but stayed in the city for expensive elegance. restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, we are rude, it’s rude." The sergeant snorted and sipped crispy soup, when he saw the owner quietly Cut the black sirloin beef, the knife and fork and the plate did not make a slight noise, can not help but explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, etiquette is something that binds people. On my boat, you can relax."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dessert after dessert A one made of fish fat When he was a sweet flesh, Sheffield asked, "Hello, where is your ship ready to go? If you are on the beach, can you put me down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Please don't worry, the boat has just passed through Bali and sailed along the fairway towards Xiwan Port. If the wind direction and the trend have not changed much, you can reach the port before 3 pm."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very strange route that wraps around a large circle, and there are many reefs near Bali, and few ships will be near it. The sergeant thought, but he did not stand to direct the normal course of the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a small request, I hope not to bother you too much." The owner said, "For some reason, I want to ask you to send me for me." A message to Feidu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I am happy to help." Sheffield is very happy to be able to repay the generous kindness of the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes four and a half days to get to the capital from the bus stop at Xiwan Port. If you take a faster passenger ship, it only takes two days and one night, then he can The port of Feidu was looking for a boat to return to Queens Island. The brothers of the military camp must have thought that they were dead. They were still in silence, but they could scare them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s all about raising your hand, it’s not a reward, and he doesn’t agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They used the meal and the owner said to him, "Please come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They When I came to a room on the lower deck, the sun didn't come in, so I lit a bright light. A sailor in black sat in the doorway, and there was a small window with a skateboard on the door. The sailor hung a gun under his arm, as if he was watching the movement inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the instructions of the owner, the sailor opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheffield saw a sly boy, kneeling on the bed, his hands around his knees, muttering to himself, and he whispered a sweet voice The name, a very violent curse, suddenly squirmed lips, as if communicating with the invisible things, the eyes are bright red blood, like a madman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
