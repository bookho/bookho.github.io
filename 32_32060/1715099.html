			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The fire rushed past An Mei’s body, she felt that she was falling into the bottomless black hole, falling down, no end, only the darkness Around her waiting for her is a bleak gloom. It seems that there are some illusions of fragmentation. She has seen herself. She is younger than her, and her eyes are filled with the joyful and tenderness of her eyes. Holding her hand, they are close together, and they look intimate, as if they are inseparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is that? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried to look up, but it was a faceless man, Yan Rong was wrapped in the shadow, he raised her face, with the illusory fingers With her lips, he is like a ghost ghost crawling out of the grave. There is no body temperature and no physical form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his head and kissed her, she only felt a foggy wind, blowing gently over the lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are we going home?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Home?" She was shocked in her chest and carefully distinguished This strange word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strong pain attack, and she felt so sullen that she was torn in half by the invisible force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zolf Lunge is locked in the eyebrows. He thought that things are getting better and better, and it’s not far from the days of practicing the boxing of justice. But this girl seems to have a weird ill, similar to a migraine, but when the attack is called, others are moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I left the limestone mountain range, the girl still looked stunned. Zall's law was already a lame disability. The broken knees were so painful from time to time, no Her help is estimated to be trapped in the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to your analysis, my brother... No, Joe Corleone, what did you do to me before?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl turned a rabbit caught in the bush on the campfire, recorded the skin, was being baked and kept falling, the fragrance made the two hungry people have some Can't wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A very effective specific brainwashing agent, he should control you with drugs, but he is afraid that you will recover your memory someday." The medicine bottle handed to him was unscrewed, and a few pills were poured into the palm of his hand, and some powder was tasted with his fingers. He knows nothing about pharmacy and can only use the only clues to infer. "So, that is certainly not a good thing. In more detail, you can only find the shadow king and personally confess."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will always catch him, and the guy has also abducted my horse." An Mei narrowed her eyes. It is like a crystal clear green scorpion, with the shadow of the devil's cruelty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is talking about cutting the wind, the shadow king is expecting the girl’s revenge, and when he hurriedly transferred the stronghold, he rode the bloodline and the fastest. Champion horse, but just out of the mountains, along the road to the Golden Horn Bay, tracking the appearance of Joe Corleone, the evil symptoms attacked in an untimely manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headache of the ills makes the girl suffer. The auditory hallucination makes her seem to be in the gap between the two worlds. As a result, she often lacks a sense of cognition about reality. She suddenly becomes awake and suddenly becomes conscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were forced to stop moving forward. The girl’s current state is not suitable for trekking and fighting. If she lacks her help in force, Zall Law can’t cope with any enemy attack with her still weak body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the girl and ventured into a small town. Fortunately, suffering and inner suffering made his appearance very old and changed quite a bit. The residents of the town only care about their own livelihoods, and they will not doubt a stomping. The worn-out ordinary old man is being wanted all over the country, and he is guilty of sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found a small hotel and asked for a room. When the owner looked at An Mei in a coma and nightmare, he asked sympathetically, "Old gentleman, you Is the daughter sick? Need a doctor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daughter? Zall Law thought to himself, he was only forty-five years old, two years ago. Still an energetic secret policeman, now, even if he is over 60 years old, some people believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is a good cover. So Zolfa nodded. "My daughter is sick, a little fever, need a rest, please prepare me a cup of hot milk and simple meals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This It is useless to see a doctor, and he does not know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cup of milk is cold, the girl has not recovered, she keeps licking Li, breathing quickly, shouting some ambiguity, unclear if. A lot of hot flashes of sweat soaked the clothes, and the exposed cheeks and neck were wet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zall's law is going to warm the water, using a hot towel to wipe the girl's sweat. He touches the drenched clothes that can simply unscrew the water, and feels the chin in a dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the store saw the guests struggling to step down from the stairs and hurriedly went up. "You still need something."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have old clothes?" Zallfa gasped and asked, a few steps to make him sweaty and his legs hurt. "I want a son-in-law, help." The daughter wiped the whole body and changed the underwear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has more or less moral cleanliness, and the drow is stubborn and distorted. Values, but at least for women, comparable to the most humble gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stems from his love for his mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner’s wife has old clothes, she drove into the room with a basin and helped Anmei clean it. When she came out, she was puzzled. Zall Law said, "The old father, to help the sick little daughter wash his body, what is it worth to be scrupulous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zall law does not know how to answer Can only nod in a vague way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed the door, leaned on the chair, thought about the mind, and some arrangements in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help yourself to punish the crime, punish the murderer, redeem the sins of the heart, and...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He looked at the beautiful girl, even in the pain, and gradually fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early hours of the morning, the girl recovered a little bit of wisdom. She rubbed her forehead and prepared to jump out of bed, only to find that her clothes had been changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you change the land for me?" She asked with a smile and awakened Zall Law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I ask the owner of the hotel to help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, yes." She put the blanket on her body and used her fingers to manage the messy hair. She said in an understatement, "If you touch me, because of the reward for the help of life, I won't kill you, only knock you out." Legs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike a certain kind of feeling hidden in a man's heart, An Mei simply regards him as an ally who can use wisdom, and when they support each other to complete their respective revenge, they will part ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you ordered?" Zall method changed the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not quite right." She knocked her head in annoyance and reached out to Zall Law. "Give me the medicine.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't always be in this state of weakness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let you give it, less Luo." There is a clear desire in the girl's tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the medicine, closed her eyes and rested on the pillow, and Zall method carefully looked at An Mei’s look. He seems to have seen a drinker who satisfies his incomparable look after satisfying his alcoholic addiction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drug addiction?" Drow's brow frowned. He had seen such a good person, even if he knew something was bad for him. It is also difficult to get rid of psychological dependence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you close the room, only provide clear water and food, you can give up. But..." Zall said with grief. He was incapable of forcing this to do so, and he could only admire it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei also clearly stopped taking the medicine. As time goes by, the effectiveness of the brainwashing agent will gradually weaken until it disappears, but she can't stop her stupid behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I try to take as little as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gritted her teeth and tried to reduce herself The dependence on drugs is only when the headaches occur most frequently, and it is really intolerable. Only a small amount of swallowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first. She is also happy to say that it seems to remember something, a bustling city on the waterfront. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A kindly but vague old grandmother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She recalled from the lost, leaving only a thin layer of veils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything seems to be getting better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was something that forced her to change her decision, which happened on the road to the Gulf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwilling to be chased by the shadow king, clear of the sequelae caused by brainwashing, he believes that An Mei will stop taking medicine, hoping to get rid of the imprisonment in his mind, and this It was when she was weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left a few cadres as the dynasty, let them focus on the main roads in batches, if you find the enemy trails, look for opportunities to solve the trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not yet in the golden corner. However, there are still many vehicles along the road. The large caravans, the public buses and the small private carriages on the roads are not stopping. Zall Law finds a small truck with a simple and ruthless car. The driver is a compassionate countryman. The money allowed them to get on the bus and handed them a thin, broken floor mat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open compartment is full of fodder, the climate is pleasant, and the warm sunset at dusk is very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road is green on both sides. There are patches of open fields, groves and hills, and small villages with dark shadows in the distance. The air is full of natural fragrance of flowers and plants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style of painting slightly reduced the resentment of An Mei’s heart. She endured a headache, chewed the meat and asked, “How much is left?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two vengeful people have neglected one thing, An Mei does not have much money on the concept, what he wanted before, and the members of his own organization offered it with both hands; Zall's mind, mainly thinking about how to use the power of the girl to find the crow he has been tracking, but forgot to take away some valuable things when he left the abandoned position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banknotes let the witty alligator and the mysterious assassin taste the troubles of the laity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are dozens of pieces," said Zall Law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I waited for the bustling town, I went to get some." The girl’s eyes closed tightly, rubbing her head with pain, she was fed up, if It is a luxurious and comfortable light carriage, and she must be able to reduce her pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't do it too fast, avoid more trouble, and cause the attention of the authorities... No, we seem to be in trouble now." Zall Law stared into the distance. "There is a car that follows us, has already followed one." Many hours. I can't see the people in the car, can you see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of Anmei is mainly controlled by the spirit, not the ** The martial arts, the headache's interference has a particularly profound impact on her. She exerted her ability to use the dragon pulse in a laborious and covert manner. After half a minute, she fired her eyes. "It is Guti, the organizer, there are two people in the carriage, they dare Boldly follow up, instead of disappearing, pray that I won't go to the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are not suffering from illness, you will find them a few hours ago. "Zolf can't help but frown. "The enemy also found this. Miss, although you are famous in the Dragon, but the enemy is a group of cold-blooded assassins, they will not be willing to hide in Tibet, if not removed. Shadow King, the danger still exists."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then they still don't do it? I am lying here weakly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Gulf is circulating a thing that Chu Jun was kidnapped by the Dragon Maiden There are too many people on the road. If there is a supernatural battle, they will reveal their whereabouts. We are hiding from the authorities’ search. They are also the same.” Zolfa said, he looked back and asked the driver, "Mr., the road ahead." How.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect to be so prosperous in the Golden Horn Bay.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Big, he shouted several times, the driver only heard, and replied loudly, "Of course, here is the only way from the mountains to the bay, and then open half a mile. At the fork, the car will be much less. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy is trying to get there." Zall said that he took out the medicine and watched the girl swallow, hoping she could recover her strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to adjust the spiritual wavelength, and the energy of the Dragon's pulse, and the effect of the drug will take some time to play a role." Anzhen coldly said, "two respects Although the Guti is not up to the scope of the king, it is a bit of a strength. If you can't use the field of the prosecutor, it is very troublesome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracking The assassins apparently found the target to discover them. Although it is best to work in remote areas, it is imperative to relieve An Mei. They whispered for a while, speeding up the speed of the carriage and preparing for a desperate attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisis is waiting to be made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the crowd gathers to fight between the dragons? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day, this is undoubtedly like a urchin wearing a tree branch and wearing a horse cell, the Chu Jun was kidnapped, the police and the army are eagerly searching for the enemy’s mouth, and the whole Byron’s eyes Attracted to him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if they are willing to reveal their identity, Zall Law is not willing, the Shadow King has the blessing of the reserve, and he and the girl have no backup. If you exchange fire in a place with a lot of people, you will be able to make it difficult for others to understand the appearance and physical characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped An Mei’s move to prepare for the battle, and quickly thought about the method of delaying the time, and the small truck that was riding slowly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" asked Zall Law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Checkpoints, the recent on-road inspections are very strict, and they are all counterfeit." The coachman’s tone was quite dissatisfied, and the army took over. All the intersections in the entire Gulf region hope to find clues about the kidnappers. But the country people are not interested in the political situation, they are more concerned about their own livelihood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zall Law looked at the checkpoint, and a soldier from the detachment was inspecting all the passing cars in detail, and he had an idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man in a red-hot uniform with long boots on his feet and a small officer with a bright feather hat on his head, embroidered with a military rank and The badge that was compiled shows that the soldiers belong to the company of the firearms camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary freight wagon, the driver holds the ID card and lives in the neighboring village. Although there are two passengers on the carport, one is The old man, the one who looks like a naked body, has nothing to be suspicious. He checked it a little and gestured to remove the roadblock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good sir, please help us." Zall method at this time supported the iron railings on the carriage, and climbed up to deliberately let the soldiers It is clear that he is a helpless, old-fashioned old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" asked the small officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it’s my daughter." Zall's lips trembled and groaned, looking very pitiful. "Before getting on the bus, my daughter was stunned by the crowd. They touched her face and wanted to do those disgusting things. I also fell to the ground, but fortunately, the plainclothes police passed by and stopped them. But now, they are chasing in the car, I am worried..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An Mei cooperated with her head and her eyes were tearful. Her medicine was pale and transparent. It was very embarrassing. The girl coughed softly, like a lamb who could not help but wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of justice fills the chest of the officer, there are actually gangsters in the district, under the eyes of the sacred soldiers, bullying the old man and the weak woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The police are unable to rely on it, and they will definitely accept the money, otherwise they will not be released."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officer waved his fist and shouted in anger. "Reassure, you are safe. The empire's firearms battalion can't be allowed to be in the sky. This is happening! Now, please tell me, where are those damn cellars?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gray car behind, I want to have three people, maybe with weapons, you can be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer laughed, and he raised the long-handled rifle hanging on his shoulder. "Weapons? That just gave me lessons, their reasons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truck continued on the road, probably driving four miles, and after turning a few turns, surrounded by a wilderness, Zall Law and An Mei got off the bus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are going to the left, the road is different, thank you." He said goodbye to the good-hearted driver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are no people here. In case the group of cellars are..." said the driver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the hills, there is an old man I met." Zallfa pointed to a forest on the plain in the distance. "Don't worry, he is a forester who, with a group of stick boy, if local ruffians dare to come, mercilessly beat them "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; shadow Zhongcheng cadres Guti is an ambitious, Very embarrassed man, a few hours ago. He discovered the trace of Miss Corleone. Out of fear, he took two men with his hands and wanted to wait for reinforcements so that the target could be caught. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If something is wrong, we immediately retreat, showing weakness in front of her, is not a shameful thing." Three Dragon Pulse Assassin businessmen said. They are well aware of each other's overwhelming strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guti quickly discovered that, as the leader said, her ability was in a rare period of weakness, lying weakly and fragilely in the open-top minivan On the grass, and actually did not notice their existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was unimaginable in the past. The blush prosecutor has no flaws. It combines defense, offense, and intelligence exploration into one, almost perfect ability, and will never let the lady Like a blind eye, let the enemy approach so close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tianci opportunity!" Guti thought. If he does not rely on the help of the reinforcements. For the leader to get rid of the ills, the status in the organization can be greatly improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the prey is still famous An. Corleone, who can kill her by hand. Then, one night, his place name will spread throughout the dark world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greed of fame and fortune gradually overwhelmed the fear of the bottom of his heart. He was like a red-eyed gambler who had to use his life to gamble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he decided to find an opportunity to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The checkpoint in front of Guti calmed down his mind, and there was a detachment where the heavily armed Musketeers were stationed and could not act rashly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When looking at the prey and riding the truck through the roadblock, Guti was in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A military officer came over badly. "Get off the bus, gentlemen. Accept the inspection. I think your whereabouts are suspicious. You must thoroughly search this carriage. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guti glared at him. "I don't have time to mess with you. There are dozens of carriages here. Why do you want to search for me?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Military secret, you have no right to ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to give me trouble, damn it." Tidy fainted and slammed the window. Cursing loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer took a step back and made a gesture. The ten gunmen at the checkpoint gathered around, they pulled out the gun, the bullets slammed, and pointed the muzzle carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last warning, get off immediately, otherwise depending on your misconduct, the battalion has the authorization to shoot suspicious people." The officer was stunned and sneaked into the ground, and dared to provoke the authority of the military. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scum of this group of society must not be able to kill them. he thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guti pouted, gnashing his teeth, he was a rude and brainless before he became a dragon, and he liked to be a promising confession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suffocating makes Guti red, the brain is irrational, and the warning that the princes let them not leave the stalks thrown aside, leaving only cruel thoughts. Eleven soldiers, I will let you taste the power of the dragons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of road patrols came to the inspection, they saw the actions of the soldiers, So he grabbed his mount and asked aloud, "Less, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are coming right." The officer replied, "There is a suspicious situation, the other party defies the order." And refused to be inspected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always some confident dragons who regard themselves as fearless supermen, but forget that they are essentially in nature. It is a common character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰砰", the gunshots are loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the three Dragon Assassins are surrounded by more than 20 gun guards, there is nothing they can do. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night is gradually shrouded in the sky, the crescent moon and the stars shine together, Guti sweet teeth grin, his exoskeleton ability is not I didn't suffer much damage, but the other two were miserable. Ma Du's chest was torn by bullets, and was shot on the spot. Bronze's leg was broken and a large piece of meat was missing from the shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had to leave the ball that could no longer act, and he smashed the encirclement alone, fleeing in the wilderness like a dog, until the night, Only by the darkness to avoid the cavalry to track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a dragon, mastering the power of non-humans, actually, actually..." Guti fell down in the mud, braving the blue veins on his forehead He whispered incredulously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
