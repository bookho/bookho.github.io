			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The Bulls Avenue Construction Project is located in the east of Tantin, and is four miles long. It is an important traffic button connecting the Arc de Triomphe and the city. On the Augustus Square, half a block away from the avenue, there is a zero-mile mark representing the Byron Highway. This road has been a long time, almost the same age as the history of Tantin, and has been modified many times. Digging the surface of the black asphalt, you can find the different road materials of each era, red brick, bluestone, cement...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Frey Rubbing his eyes, carefully reading the information provided by the authorities, he wore a thick canvas coat in the hemp, and shuttled through a piece of stone that was turned over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the closest to Tantin’s main sewer.” He circled the map with a red pen and said to the project manager Moore, “All construction will be done. The staff is divided into teams, each team is only responsible for a specific area, and our people take over the valuable lots."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And", Fran took out another map, pointing to a wilderness about ten miles east of the city, "Swan Palace, according to tradition is the collection of Jun Hey, I need a secret passage that I can sneak into."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s very troublesome, it’s too far away, there are no sewers available outside the city, you need to do it hard. A lot of people, but also have large machinery, so it is difficult to hold outsiders." Moore replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, outside the city of Thandin is the Tiber River. There is a groundwater channel responsible for diverting water into the Swan Palace and connecting me there."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The godfather and the count in front of him, what are they trying to do? Moore was puzzled, but he suppressed curiosity and nodded in agreement. "So, it can save a lot of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore is a loyal person, Fran I am very grateful to Lauvita for bringing this good helper, but for the ashes girl, Fran is deeply troubled by her personality, not that Lauvita is not worthy of dependence. But when the girl is thinking about things, she always puts his interests first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, Lauvita does not hesitate to smear bloody hands, and darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She always has to live for herself, not always thinking about me." Fran sighed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, Fran returned to the construction of Liujin Street in a carriage, and just walked into the lobby on the first floor, Mrs. Bellamy, who was responsible for the reception work. Said to him. “A lady is waiting for you at your office.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Who is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't say the name, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, just let a stranger stay in my office?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Bellamy is uneasy, "But that lady is very beautiful, I thought it was your friend..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Fran was ready to say something, but glimpsed Mrs. Bellamy's fearful expression and shook her head. "It's not an example." He walked upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't it be the boss's lover?" Mrs. Bellamy thought strangely. "So cute girl, telling the boss, and telling the boss." Many things. Who can bear to reject her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can't bear to reject Isa? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Tandin’s politics, only to enjoy the dance, Isa Don Reinschmann’s name is far more than her cousin Peggy It’s loud. Although many people say that this woman is just a superficial vase, it must be admitted that it is the most exquisite and beautiful vase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa is not tall, just eighteen years old, with maroon scented hair, violet eyes, striking face and sly curves People are amazed, especially the baby face, revealing a natural innocence that makes people feel. No matter what kind of harshness she said, or the gesture of making a slap in the face, it’s like a little girl who is spoiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She admires her cousin, who has been wandering behind her cousin since she was a child, often imitating the taste of Peggy, but also appraising others as "monkeys" from Peggy The mouth spit out, like a cold wind with poisonous gas. It is embarrassing and embarrassing, but by Isa, it makes people laugh at the disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the girl can be a little smarter, at least what can be done better than me." Peggy once said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today she was very happy. At noon, there was also a lady in the social circle who said that the aristocratic youth of the young man was around her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Isa, beautiful Isa, your smile makes the winter full of fireworks, your frown brings a cold night, please don't torture me The cruel Isa."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The esoteric love makes the beautiful princess of the gorse family proudly dance, she does not like the man in front, but She loves this feeling of being regarded as a treasure, and enjoys this glamorous eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, this is just a shallow little woman. Like many high-class youths, they don't worry about their livelihoods, and they don't have any ambitions. They spend their time in theaters, dances, travel, love, and communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are I cruel? Dear David."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I... I heard the rumors, which made me collapse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Areas?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your father, don't you want to marry the family of the Knights?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl's face fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa did not talk about true love, she only imagined it as full of all kinds of beautiful things, flying leaves, rose flowers, quiet trails and stars. Beyond the secular realm of fairyhood, her lover should be an extraordinary, extravagant and gentle man, knowledgeable, knowing the difference between Daqi and Michelle in the genre of painting, clearing the masterpieces of all poets, and being able to present himself. The insights, and with the hot feelings, melted themselves like a fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, His Royal Highness Prince Julius is the materialization of the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s true that Peggy is always able to catch the best, and others can’t grab it,” she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, they actually put Isa and a stupid, indifferent Ingema earthen bun together, I really don't know why the cousin praised him, even his father had a heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She regards the Quasimodo Berkshire as a barbaric who wandered around in her early years and made a scar, a tens of thousands, but the slightest There is no style of earthen buns, a person who will play with some plants like this kind of person, how can it be compared with the princess of the gorse? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should have been ecstatic, full of red light carrying a full car of roses, and Houhou was in front of the door; it should have been awkwardly reading the love letter copied. Imagine being able to ask for even one percent of love, and myself, scornfully laugh, ridicule his ignorance and self-importance, and make him the most funny joke in the circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn’t become a joke, he’s right. That damn beast. The businessman who was covered in copper stinked and refused the marriage in an understatement, as if he was an insignificant country girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Isa sister, I heard that you were stunned by a ugly?" Someone and her are not pleasing to each other, often you ridicule me, I laugh at you. The Marquis of the Marquis, who publicly used this topic to marry her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she is sitting in the barbarian’s office, ready to reprimand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is well decorated and the floor is covered with the finest rubber wood. The texture of the wood is soft and soft, and it is soft and comfortable. There are several thick books and a large stack of newspapers on the desk. She flipped through the book with a boring look. The title of the book is "The Original of the Hobbel." The Law, which contains a lot of words and a trivial note, makes Isa a little faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It is a kind of power. It carries the spirit of barbarism and anger and revenge in the rules, which is based on humanism. But the law can't be mixed with people's emotions. It must be calm, ruthless...what bad books. Even the illustrations are not." The girl thought, in her concept, the book should be equivalent to the fashion magazine full of color painting and advertising. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened silently. She was shocked by Isa. She threw the book in a panic and felt that the behavior was too weak. So she coughed twice and sat up, squinting at the man in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is her first time to look at Fran at close range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clothes were cut and cut, and there was no exaggerated shiny ornaments. He walked to the door and hung the black trench coat and wide-brimmed hat on the lacquered hanger. The shirt was bulging. Showing an unusually strong male chest, with masculine elegance, no imaginary black and dense hair on the arm, the face is completely disfigured by numerous criss-crossing scars, but the expression is very serious, slightly reddish Huanren is looking forward to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five minutes." His voice was soft and rhythmic, and he lived like a scholar living in a book, and he had a wonderful sense of peace with his enlarged appearance. So that Isa did not understand what it means. "呃?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms., you have five minutes to explain, I am very busy, around four o'clock, there is a meeting to open."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa immediately added a word of uncultivated after a lot of malicious comments, so treating a lady so coldly is not a proper act of a gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Isa Don Reinschmann."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, yes Miss of the gorse family? What is your job?” The tone is flat. “Do you have business affairs?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t you have heard of it, Or don't remember my name?" Isa was annoyed, she couldn't stand this indifference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"喔", the man thought for a moment, "I have a business relationship with Reinschmann, but also maintain a certain friendship, but can not remember The name of each member."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn!" Isa suddenly felt that it was a mistake to come here, she tried to communicate with the barbarians who had no memory ability, only Can scream and scream, "You must tell me, don't want to hit my idea, whether it is now or in the future, as long as my father, or Peggy cousin, like you mentioned something about me, you have to answer" Do not,! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl gasped, her cheeks rose red, and she waited for the man to say something.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are two more minutes. "Fran looked at the watch calmly. "If you have nothing else, I will be happy to shorten the time." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am strong enough, I really want to kill him. The girl thinks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
