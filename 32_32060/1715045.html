			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;."I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Casimodo, you have considered getting married "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran again heard the topic that made him feel a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meteja Demi, 19, the second daughter of the Count of Tantin, although the Count of Demi is not a big aristocrat, but his family has a long history. Pure blood; Anna Lilliso Simoni, 24 years old, the only daughter of Marquis Simone, and the Marquis has no children, if you have a descendant, you can even use the title of the old Marquis in exchange for the official Earl with the hereditary rights Identity, as far as I know, they are very interested in you." "My Highness, this makes me think that you are breeding for a horse." Fran touched his chin and made a laugh, "I am sorry, I I have to be rejected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Material?" Peggy also laughed. "It is indeed a very appropriate statement. Marriage between nobles can be Not to maintain the purity of the blood, and to make the family more prosperous and prosperous." "Single, let me have a good time, at least for now, I have no idea of ​​forming a family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you are surrounded by a lot of beautiful The flower, the famous head of the Cardinals Theatre, and the beautiful little orc that I have seen in your home, and your ex-wife should also be a beautiful woman." Seeing Fulan doubts The eyes, Peggy shrugged, explained, "I heard your daughter, although not healthy, but also a little beautiful, it is clearly inherited the mother's blood."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether you think that I am remembering my lost wife, or fascinated by the flowers, it doesn't matter." Fran answered, "I want to pursue other things more."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Casimomod, the identity of the Earl of the Palace, is not worthy of your life-saving grace. But the terms of the Charter restrict me to give you a more practical title. However, it is not a complete repayment, but it is not a comfortable thing," Peggy said. "If you can marry the aristocrats of Byron, then there are many loopholes in the charter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She continued, "Or, you Like beauty? Meteaya and Anna are really just Chinese, I have a better recommendation, Isa Don Reinschmann, one of my cousins. Just turned 17 years old, although my mind is full It’s a paste, but it looks very handsome, at least a monkey wrapped in a beautiful skin.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you really think that I am interested in the title?" Fran is almost sneer, he hates Peggy's attempt to use the attitude of others in his life. "Speaking of money, my assets are sufficient." Squandering in my life; speaking of status, I have a good reputation; talking about hobbies. I am more full of adventure and investment. I can use the whole world as a paradise for me to play.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And an aristocrat can only think about the family. It takes life to nothingness in the politics of nothingness. This kind of life is chilling when you think about it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Standard hedonists." Peggy did not care about Fran's tone, she happily commented, "Okay, dear Quasimodo, I just explored, you are "What kind of person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good sire, I am a friend, not thinking about seeking benefits from you." Fran wiped his forehead Excited and sweating. He took out the bottle of red wine from the box, and filled it up for himself. Qianlong drank it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy noticed that there was a sweat on the glass wall of the empty glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the mind is smart, in some respects, it will act according to a strong personality, not the kind of deep-rooted conspiracy. Trust in such people And friendship is far more effective than pure material attraction." She thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Too calm and indifferent, will make others think that there is another picture, and occasionally, I have to pretend to be impulsive." He thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and her have both made falsehood and disguise as cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't mind, I will continue the topic just now." Peggy's face showed an inexplicable expression, "In fact, the few that I just said Miss, but crying and crying at home, my monkey cousin, even screaming to commit suicide, said that he would rather die than to marry a strange geek."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is better." Fran said without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The women of Tantin are all monkeys who look at people by appearance. They don't understand. Compared with the appearance, the things in their heads are more important. Times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can I understand this as a compliment?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“With yours.” She leaned forward, moisturizing her petal lips, revealing a strange Shallow vortex. The beautiful face was close, and Fran even felt that when she was breathing, the nose was slightly twitching, the warm breath, and itching his cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Azure in the blue, reflecting the appearance of Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, how do you feel about me compared to the mother monkey?" She said, the voice was a little hoarse, a teasing, mature woman's voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, please stop joking." Fran was slightly biased. "I don't want to, I received a white glove from the Crown Prince's High Court." "Of course it's a joke, I want to tease you." Soon, Peggy leaned back and leaned back on the couch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does she want to do?" Fran looked at the lady who was very happy and cast her vigilant eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting gun rang, and the boxers passed out to yell at the mounts, and a new round of horse racing began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰砰,砰,砰砰砰..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet is rubbed out on the rock The traces of white, from the tip of Zolfa Longqi’s nose, counted the rhythm between bullets, he felt that his lungs must be full of blood, so that with a big mouth and a breath, a bloody smell filled In the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right shoulder slammed a shot, the blood stained the majority of the clothes, and the blood loss made Zall Law's dizziness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He trembled and checked the guns on the gun. There were three bullets left and the other had nine people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a narrow road that protrudes along a cliff, with a rock on one side and a cliff nearly 30 meters high on the other. On the rock wall that is going down on the cliff, there is no movement, and there are enemies at both ends of the mountain. He is trapped in the encirclement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this narrow road that only allows one person to pass, so that he is not immediately killed, but the other party can take turns to rest, he alone, and will only be fatigued And the injury hits across. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
