From the outside, she had no abnormalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, the bizarre, unclear kiss was confusing, he was not stupid to believe, but with his own charm, let this beautiful The enemy suddenly burst into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a subtle cognition in the bottom of my heart. He suddenly discovers that he is better described by Peggy as a "female enemy" rather than an "enemy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this little difference has no practical meaning, nor can it detract from Fran’s deep hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is impatient with the voice, "Are you listening?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, please continue Fran answered that he had been honed to conceal the real psychological activities, and he did not look at his eyes. He ignored his doubts and retracted his thoughts and listened to Missy’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peiji is sitting at the old walnut desk, this is the antique of the An Yi II period (the fourth Maharaja of Byron), carved on the whole frame The exquisite undulating scrolls, the legs of the table are slightly outer arcs, the underlay is carved into the shape of the claws of the claws, and the euphemistic gold pattern with the cracked brown-red primer makes it look extravagant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two curvy legs are stacked on the table, the first two feet of the seat leave the floor slightly, and the lady will stir the silver spoon in the coffee cup. To stir up, very indecently leaning backwards, the red lips lightly open, revealing the white teeth of the neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leaned back to the chin on a letter from the desk, "100 million Caesar, can be paid by the equivalent of jewelry, but refuses options stocks and bonds The new request from the kidnappers. The money can even buy a small vassal state in some countries, making him a hereditary duke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan holds a The rooted match was gently turned under the squeaking cigar. The light smoke was flowing around, giving off a fragrant smell of tobacco. He shook his nose and took a deep breath, shaking his head. “Equivalent to all liquidity of a medium-sized bank, if you are solely from a money standpoint, His Royal Highness Crown Prince is worth the money.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was a laughing stock. When the church was the most powerful in the past, the Emma VI of Portugal and the Netherlands refused to send troops to participate in the jihad of the Crusaders. It was deprived of the throne by Anno. Finally, he paid 70 million worth of gold. Only the swearing book of forgiveness was obtained, and the greedy gangster apparently wanted to surpass the peak and get the most ransom in history.” Peggy slid the hair covering her cheek to the side, laughing, and the voice was cold. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you afford it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not the person who controls the national treasury Peggy replied, "Although I can raise ideas, but I have to deal with bankers, those financial speculators. The mouth is the most unreliable. It is equal to let everyone guess: a woman When the husband was kidnapped, he suddenly needed a large sum of money, which had a reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Either the gorse or the royal family, can afford it, I don't understand why you have to go it alone." Fran deliberately said, "Do you have any difficulties?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius's stupid and weak man, actually crazy! Caused me to have no retreat. Peggy thought, but he replied in his mouth, "It has been unbearable for me to be coerced again and again. The kidnapper even said aloud, I have to promise him five requirements! I can imagine. Next, his appetite will Bigger. "This statement is like the reason why Peggy hides the inside story from the royal family. He wants to solve the trouble alone. It is because of private pride and disapproval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullan sighed and said in her words, "Don’t be silly, you can’t control everything.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid? You seem to describe a housewife, a little woman who only wanders around her husband's children, is stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In a certain sense, Wang Hao is also a distinguished housewife. If you can calmly think about it, you should understand that it is the best way to put yourself out of the game." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran said, "It may be your love for His Royal Highness, so that you can’t stay awake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Peggy pouted, she did not love Julius, but this can not be said in front of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked Fran, "Can you take out 10 million for others to detect? I can't move the property on the bright side."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can barely, after all, I have nothing to do with the national treasury." Fran answered, "But the other party is worth 100 million."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if it is a business between merchants, There will be steps to pay the deposit and inspection. If the kidnapper really intends to trade with me, he has to show sincerity." Peggy explained, "10 million, I have to see my husband, confirm that he is still alive, relying on Words can get 100 million? It’s just a night’s sleep.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The other party may agree, but you have to pay attention to safety.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I will negotiate with the enemy and choose the right place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Micro closed his eyes, it seems After a while, I said, "If you make up 10 million cash, this will end my large investment in Portugal. I have to go there in person. It is estimated that it will take half a month to go back and forth." "The time has been dragging on for too long." Peggy glared at the eyebrows that were slightly up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you get through the bank transfer, you need to provide a safe and covert account."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Considered for a few minutes, I thought it was only like this. "So, I will leave when I am in the sky." Fran stood up straight, slightly squatting, then went to the hanger on the side of the door, took off the gray wide-brimmed hat and coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey..." Peggy whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What else is there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Why do you try your best to help me? In my understanding of people, there is no assistance in the world for no reason, rights, money, beauty, or even just to satisfy the boring, so-called moral sense of being happy for the success of others. Which kind do you belong to?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest suspicion of Peggy is that she can't figure out what the man really wants, her values, so that Missy never believes in paying for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Fran answered, "I am a traveller who traveled around the country, is a low-ranking nobleman of Ingmar, and for your sake, The title of Count Byron, but in essence, I am a businessman.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been an ancient record in the East. If we use our words to understand, we can invest in ordinary commodities and have a hundred dollars of income. If we invest in valuable commodities, we can get the profits of thousands of dollars, but if we invest in a country, we will be profitable. "I am just investing, if you can remember this friendship. Even if I don't need anything, maybe I will have a son who will build a family in Byron and they will get a return."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hah, do you regard me as a strange goods?" Peggy has a certain understanding of the culture of the East, and also knows the story, she observes the man's look and feels the other side. What is said is the words of the lungs. So chuckle, "Do you want to be a latecomer? I will satisfy you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened and closed, and the man’s burly figure disappeared. In sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl put her hands on the flat belly, and the scorpion exudes a strange light. "It will satisfy you, for example, let your son become Byron." The emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She already felt that being taken by the enemy with her nose was extremely dangerous. To get out of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are shortcuts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before that, she had to make a child, and. Let a nominal husband disappear forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the end, you still have to rely on men, okay, hopefully the process will be pleasant." The girl thought, "I heard the first feeling, like being an awl." The pain of the meat, and, from the body point of view, the guy's awl is estimated to be extra large."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there are still considerable resistance to the implementation of the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After pregnancy. She can't let the child's true father continue to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is easy. Although the Earl of the Knights of the Court is physically strong and proficient in potions, it is said to be an apprentice of an alchemist, but it is not difficult to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I will give you a painless and peaceful way to die." Missy rarely had a glimpse of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles will doubt whether the fetus in the belly is a royal blood relative, and Anno has the magic to detect blood. In order to win the trust of the world, she has to rely on the power of the Holy See. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy had considered this point early, and the envoy of Arnold in Byron, Lord Fei Yi Li Lisi, was already her, and there was also the tempting prop of the Eternal Cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father will certainly take advantage of the situation, attempting to control the royal family through her, and at the beginning it is necessary to succumb to the snake. After the status is stable, she will not let go. Think of yourself as a family of political trades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the Emperor’s Majesty, the old man is always the biggest trouble, he is the owner of Byron after all, her little tricks, and the deal with Anno, it’s hard I passed the royal eyeliner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day, when Peggy got up, a special emergency message from Wang Du, made Missy feel sad, she repeatedly read it several times. Then I couldn’t stop showing a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remote corner of somewhere in the golden corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran at the pre-agreed place, boarded the Black King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautita threw himself into his arms and confided with his unrestrained kisses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man feels the warm body of a woman in his arms. He thinks of An Mei, the guilt of a sneak peek, and his body becomes Stiff, Fran gently pushed Lavetta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl sensitively noticed this subtle change, and there was a faint glimmer in the gray scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two quickly returned to normal, Fran calmly said, "By the Portuguese bank, prepare 10 million cash, and then through private channels, let Money flows into Byron and is deposited in an account. Also, inform Zall Law to start the next step of planning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish Laurenta also answered calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This autumn and winter, this season symbolizes fertility and harvest, because of a series of bizarre and unusual things, it becomes gloomy and sullen. When the situation changed, Byron had another important event, as if the dark gray cloud finally broke the opening, and fell into the sinister rain, so that everything accelerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang Dutan, the golden lion palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joan VIII strolls in the Royal Court arcade, he is worried, thin and thin, and adds some decaying folds, coughing from time to time, such as every step The old man who entered the leap year, the vitality has disappeared from the body, but the long-term power of the life, so that the emperor's eyes are still looking forward to life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The follower advised him to go back to the palace to rest, and he was interrupted rudely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it necessary to be controlled by you in your own court?" he whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weak court people sighed in awe and asked for forgiveness. They all knew that the experience of Chu Jun had made his mood unstable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, Qing, etc. retreat, let the joint walk alone." The emperor sighed, only the despicable weak, will apply anger to the weaker In the human body, he is too rude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrace garden is dotted with a large number of statues, fountains, pavilions and flower terraces. The central lawn is digged with an elegant artificial lake. The emperor is a pragmatic People who are not willing to put money into the re-repair of the inner court, except for the living things that can grow, such as flowers and shrubs, are mostly traced by the years. It looks quaint and vicissitudes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked along the winding cobblestone path, slowly walking to the lakeside, sitting in the exquisite small pavilion, the silver fox fur big porcelain The bag is tight, the sky is not very cold, but he still feels a deep chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man squinted his head and stared at the sparkling lake, reflecting an old face in the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am old after all." The emperor thought. He is about to pass the 60-year-old birthday, and the court etiquette hall has been busy preparing for the grand celebration ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixty years old, still a long way from the real Jubilee, Joan VIII’s mind still maintains reason and wisdom, but this damn body makes him I had to consider the succession to the throne a few years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the child is not enough to be arrogant. If he is just a prince, he must be immersed in the world of art. Be a connoisseur or a second-rate poet. Happy to live the rest of the life, but a Chu Jun, the future of Julius IX. This invaluable title is already doomed with heavy responsibilities and pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joan VIII is a qualified monarch. Byron's throne has been passed down through generations. It has already been full of decay and laziness, leading to a wealthy family like the gorse, beyond the control of the royal family. He used his life for a lifetime. Energetic, support the new aristocracy, suppress the old family, in the first place. The top nobility of Byron is not a minority. Up to now, the once-popular Duke of Clemence has split into two inferior counties, three barons; the Duke of Lindsay and the imperial inheritance who control the financial power of the country. Phase, he was imprisoned in the Barents than the Imperial Prison, and secretly died two years later. By the way, he also dethroned this too strong position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Leinschmann, known as the gorse that never fades. Under the subtle command of the patriarch, the emperor even suspected that he would help the old fox of the Duke of Sama, and smooth all competitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you give him another ten years, Joan VIII is convinced that he can fight with him, but even the supreme emperor is, after all, a mortal, can’t get rid of old and sick. Imprisonment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The study of the Eternal Cabinet has made no progress. I am not stupid because of old age. I want to turn my face with the Holy See for the illusory legend." He thought that if it was useless, it would be better to send it to the church and smooth the cracks, at least not to bring another enemy to the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Julius, have the idea to save the child safely. If it is not to appease the situation, the emperor can’t wait to remove all the high-rises in the Golden Horn. Official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heir to the empire, was kidnapped on the territory of the empire? They are sinful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't fall down now, there are too many things to deal with." Joan VIII is tired and sleepy, now is not leisure At that time, he wanted to stand up and go to the servant to be comforted, to urge the Prince Cooper to do his duty and pay attention to the recent movements of the House of Lords...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sense of paralysis swept the whole body, and the emperor was horrified to discover that his body no longer accepts the command of the brain. He wants to shout, but can't make any sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the order, the court can only follow far away, they squat down to rest on the lakeside pavilion, so they stop and wait The emperor calmed the anger and summoned them to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiting time was too long. The emperor leaned on the fence of the pavilion and turned his back to the road. His body was slightly awkward and he had been sitting for half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a cold because of the cold, everyone will be severely punished by the court minister. Finally, a well-respected and loyal follower, boldly enters the pavilion He hurriedly crouched and called, "Your Majesty..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sneaked his head up, but looked at it with fear, the emperor’s half face was twisted, his mouth and nose were skewed, and the wet mouth drenched the collar. The expression is like a funny smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, countless elegantly decorated carriages, gathered in the wide square in front of the palace gate, the double swords around the thorns, the wolf-headed eagle The majestic bears and the light swan... On each carriage, you can find the aristocratic family emblem that symbolizes power and status. The doors are gently opened, and the big men who are in the high position have carefully walked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court minister blocked the news, but he was not in the eyes of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The one on the throne, His Majesty the Great Emperor of Byron, fainted in the garden of the inner court at four o'clock this afternoon. The doctor has confirmed the diagnosis and has a stroke. "This is a bad news spread across the big aristocratic circle of Tantin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They talked about the exchanges and exchanged their own hearings. Zhuang Mu’s Palace Square was like a rough night market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comparison of the seemingly simple carriage slowly into the square, everyone retreat, with their different expressions, watching the little on the carriage Gorse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Sama was sitting in a fur seat, and he was the first to get more details than others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke’s mouth solidified with a faint smile, and when he got off the carriage, the silky vortex had disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He scanned the crowd and said heavily, "God to the Emperor, God Bless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Although it is not stated, this is equivalent to declaring the truth of the rumors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
