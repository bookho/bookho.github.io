			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Fran Fryer’s window on the fifth floor of an old apartment, with a thorough light to make the neighborhood shine, he looked over the row of the roof , keep your eyes in a certain area half a mile away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rental agreement has been signed with the real estate agent. For two months, the entire fifth floor is used by us." Gray-eyed girl wiped the window with her finger Floating dust, "The Crown Prince and his wife will not stay in Feidu for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but the fees are a good occasion to fight, here are our forces, I can use another identity, more wrists and enemies." "What is the plan for the head?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need information about the villa "Fran said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no royal palace in the capital, the Crown Prince couple stayed in a villa belonging to the municipal government industry, elegant and beautiful, with a wide vestibule and back garden. It is worth mentioning that the interior design is like a small museum. There are several styles of halls. The walls of the Golden Rose Hall are adorned with oil paintings of the city. The corners of the corridors are carved by the hands of the masters. The Silver Coral Hall It presents an elegant oriental charm with fine mosaics, a green silk enamel on the dome, and a secluded sandalwood in the incense burner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual maintenance and labor costs are as high as 300,000, so be sure to be perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fudu is not connected to the outer street. It is the place where the federal authorities use to treat the top VIPs and government public relations. The guests who can live in have at least the Marquis. A title, or a multi-millionaire who wants to invest heavily. The drinking water system is independent of the public pipeline and is guarded. Now it has nearly doubled the guards and guard posts. The innermost security measures are taken over by the royal guards. It is not clear to the authorities responsible for the industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Crown Prince and his wife left the capital, all the servants in the government were not allowed to leave, and any outsiders would like to spy on the half-point news in the villa. Even if Fran opens the road with banknotes, he will reach the iron gate of the villa at most, and will be blocked by the loyal royal guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unless half a year in advance, I can put in a few helpers." Lauvita thought about it. "Now I want to mix in and explore the information. Arabian Nights. Or, let Cecilia slip into the night and night? With her skill, this is not a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But she can't take the place of me to observe. Many things can't be seen by the eyes." Fran touched his chin. Because the film turned into a dark blue scorpion flashed a touch of coconut, "I want to get information, do not need to go in, I think, there are a lot of light servants in the villa, eating and wearing, they can not accumulate garbage , piled up in a beautiful garden courtyard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Garbage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Valued Means, the police are used often, and often can find clues from them." That year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he worked with the patrol hall. I have learned a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many cases where the patrolmen have worked tirelessly to find the breakthrough and evidence of the case from the garbage mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds disgusting." Lauvita cocked her nose. "It's just a way. I'm going to check who manages this." "It's very dirty, but they can tell me a lot of subtle and detailed things." Fran smiled. "Any success is done by various means." Composed of, completely elegant crime? That only exists in the novel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is never a wall in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garbage trucks entering and leaving the back door are also assigned by the city government. The driver and the cleaners carry the stamped anti-counterfeiting passes, will be searched and checked, and there will be guards all the way. Followed, until the bag with the garbage was taken into the car and left. In order to avoid theft or misconduct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they can’t even manage where the trash is discarded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita quickly found out that it is a large domestic house company that manages the daily health of government agencies, from housekeepers, chefs, women workers to environmental guards. All are available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company usually buryes the disposed garbage in a place outside the city near the sea, and there are no remnants of nearby people, so they have to go to the government every year. Pay a land lease fee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, a greenhouse trailer slowly approached the barren beach, with thick canvas on the body. Under the cloth, a large number of black woven bags were piled up, and the wind blew, with a faint smell, which made people cover their noses. Therefore, in the box seat, copper bells were hung on the left and right sides, and a crisp sound was heard with the bumps. Remind passers-by and the passing cars to stay close to avoid contamination. The box car is also chosen to collect garbage when it is about to break, and when the citizens are still in a sleepy dream, they will be transported out of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From that street, it's right." A car is far behind, and Lauvita peeped her head out of the window and recognized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, go beyond the past and go to the junkyard to wait for preparation." Fran answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage quickly overtakes the past, rolling up a gust of wind, making the bell of the garbage box car louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lauvita is crying and sullen, "Head, just close, I feel very stinky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "That time I will come by myself." Fran smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, big deal after the event." The girl sighed in his ear. "Do you wash it for me?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver of the housekeeping company yawned and found two cheap cigarettes, handing one to the colleague next to him and the other to his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are really hard at work. It is dirty and stinky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, no Hey, come home every day, I have to brush a few of my own, otherwise my wife will not allow me to touch her. "They chatted, turning from the road, driving into a remote narrow road, the end is the piece Wild beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a shadow in front of the sanitation workers. At first they thought they had early arrivals, but soon they felt nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two big men, the gangs are dressed up, the waist under the coat is bulging, I don’t know if it’s a knife or a pistol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, stop, and roll down immediately." The idiot said, "Don’t bother us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing things? The sanitation workers immediately thought of many murders. The gang members often chose to go to the junkyard, execute some enemies and traitors, and then bury them on the spot and mix them with the garbage. No one would find them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are just ordinary people who get paid, and don’t want to get involved in gang disputes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sanitation worker’s teeth trembled, “Peng...friends, we have nothing to see, we will not say anything, know the rules.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gang did not nod. "That's good." He swept his eye in the box car. "Get rid of the garbage and leave. It happens. The boss needs them to be pressed in the pit, lest they come out of the ground in a few days."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it on? A horrible corpse emerged in the minds of the sanitation workers. They dared not defy and hurriedly dropped the woven bags into the car. The sooner they wished to leave, the better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they were ready to go, the shouts shouted at them and threw a stack of nearly fifty tickets. "You are lucky. But you have received a cover fee." I have to keep it secret. If there is anything in the world today, I know it, according to the rules..." He made a fierce action on the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty pieces are equivalent to the income of two sanitation workers for one month. When the boxcars move back and the workers gradually get out of terror, they are instead bizarre. Encounter, I am very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t say it out, you should be a dream. Get out of the pen." They discussed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran, Lauvita. And the two gang gunmen who were just wearing rubber raincoats, thick masks and gloves. Standing next to the fresh garbage dump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought there were only five or six bags, I didn't expect so much..." The girl frowned and muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Fran used the dagger to cut the woven bag and searched quickly. There were a few bags he only looked at and he ignored it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The food residue in the kitchen, I don't need to know what they have eaten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Checking When a pack of garbage was used, Fran slowed down and loaded with many bags. He picked up a bag. Look at the trademarks and words above, “Bird food in pet shops.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Describes that there are birds in the villa, such as canaries or nightingales.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a pigeon, it should be a square pigeon for viewing.” Fran read the explanatory text behind the bird’s food bag. “There are a lot, because there are ten Several empty bags, which are usually kept in the backyard, like flowers and shrubs, as an environmental embellishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does this clue come in handy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pigeons are social animals. If there is an outlier, you will find ways to find a large force." Fran Answer, then check the next garbage bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was a new discovery." Fran said that he pointed to a pack of rubbish, "is the middle of the room under the Crown Prince."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are more than a dozen bags here, why are you sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because ordinary servants and guards in the room, will not Put such a high-grade paper towel." Fulan used a pair of tweezers to hold a piece of paper towel that was smashed into a group. "The white paper made from pure plant fiber pulping is complicated in craftsmanship. Only the most expensive shops in Feidu are sold. Zhang can sell three hundred. Only wealthy, wealthy aristocrats and big companies will use it when writing a letter of grandeur or respect. And such expensive paper is actually processed into a paper towel for hand rubbing. It is a luxury.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, you are eligible to stay in a luxury VIP room, and only use the Crown Prince in the villa."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found a lot of paper ash in the bag, and he never found it to be a burnt corner, he found another style of paper, printed on it Pale blue stripe, Otto feel that you saw, yes, he remembered, is the fee the city government are unified specifications of the custom paper, typically used for official reports and documents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some letters on the paper that are not spelled out, and Fran selects them all and puts them in the prepared plastic bags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a little thing that caught the attention of Fran. He took it in his hands and observed it carefully. It was a yellow-brown and translucent plastic bottle that was flattened and empty. But there are some residual white small particles at the bottom of the bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of friction, the powder left by the broken tablets?" Fran thought, but there was no sign on the bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the day is about to light up, and the garbage has been spent a whole morning in Fulan, with his harvest, left the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black King is quietly moored on the sea next to Mage Island. This exquisite yacht is one of Fran’s precious treasures. He had spent a lot of energy to rebuild. Before going to Tantin, Fran purchased an VIP-level berth anonymously at a port in the Golden Horn Bay. There was someone to take care of the ship and keep it in good performance. With the necessary supplies, it can immediately become a small secret base at sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the cabin is covered with luxurious red carpets. There are various furnishings in the room. It is like the suite of the most upscale hotel. There are hidden drawers on the bedside, and there are debts and a few bags of jewels that can be exchanged for cash at any time. The washroom is also equipped with a bathtub and a water heater, and the warehouse under the deck is now filled with plenty of food and fresh water, as well as some weapons and ammunition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan with Lauvita, and several loyal gunmen, lived on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of wonderful experimental equipment in the darkroom, so that he can carry out potion blending and some research at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master Island abandoned by William Master is not on the channel line. And because of the widespread rumors of a few years ago, the rumors of the terrorist mage, the nearby fishermen rarely come to this waters to fish, is a good place to hide whereabouts, not to be noticed by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the water came from the bathroom. As soon as he returned to the Black King, Lauvita went into the bathtub, and the woman loved her nature to let her Changed a few waters. I haven't been willing to come out for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is checking the dirty loot in the lab, and every worthy harvest is sorted in a box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first picked out some of the particles in the bottle, placed it on the glass piece, and dropped a few drops of the medium for dyeing, if there were plant ingredients, The medium that the mage often uses can be dyed into different colors according to the subtle thickness of the fiber, so as to narrow the range of distinguishing components. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staining takes several hours. Fran put his attention on another discovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the corners of the government report on the table according to the texture of the paper, and the traces left by the burning. Try to piece together into a whole piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some experimental materials extracted from magical materials can show signs of writing from paper ash that has not completely burned. But it is still very difficult. When a lot of paper ash is thrown into the trash can, it turns into countless ashes. He can't restore it to the original. He can only find the rules and clues from the letters that can still be found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work took him a whole afternoon, and people who are not logically clear and insightful can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period, Lauvita came once and sent lunch to him. Fran noticed that today's dishes are light and there are no alcoholic drinks. Refreshing lemon juice is added to the cool water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This girl is very considerate and knows what kind of diet people need to think about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a note on the plate. "I just made some sweets. When you are busy, remember to eat."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran smiled, he remembered that the girl’s cooking was quite good, especially honey banana. He put the note back and began to concentrate on the cumbersome crossword puzzle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This file is lit from the bottom left corner, so the rest of the text on the upper right is more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk. He looked at the notes full of words, holding his chin and thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...(number?, place name?) person... five years (before the corpse)... seventh street (place name)... control (control? Bu...Students (the only clear and unmistakable words)...暧昧...(There is a large blank in the middle, can't be found)... Wine (bar?, drink?)...Marriage (marriage)<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disorganized, no logic at all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly moved and wrote in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Feiduren, five years ago, Seventh Street Court, prosecutors, trainees, 暧昧, bar waitress, marriage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp If you change someone, you can't organize it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is the protagonist of this report.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;These words are exactly the same as his previous experience.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did Julius investigate me? The investigation is irrelevant to him, in the eyes of the world Already dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;Franbest can't understand, he can't think of a husband's heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, in the middle of the word "暧昧", he could not find an explanation, and the connection with the context. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dyeing of the drug has been completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullan puts the glass piece under the lens and continuously replaces the new experimental sample and tests the ingredients in more ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It may be just a cold medicine, then I will waste time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all After the granules of the drug were consumed, Fran frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A small amount of plants, medium amount of minerals and some purified extracts of unknown origin, there is a concept of potions." He thought, "but not Infrequently identified ingredients often appear in the formulation of confessants and powerful brainwashing drugs. This is a chronic poison. No, it is more sinister and sinister. Their common role is to suppress the activity of the brain. Dementia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone wants to murder the Crown Prince Julius? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Fran is still not guessing from some of the more subtle aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's a poison, its ingredients are too complicated, and the weight is controlled very carefully, as if trying to avoid hurting the user too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked the table with the knuckles. "The great formula, the manufacturer’s knowledge in the medical field surpassed me a lot. For healthy people, it can cause harm. But for mentally ill patients with abnormal brains, it is a good medicine for slowly conditioning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has unknown **, Fran plays a card At the time of Simodo, he had talked with Julius for several times at various banquets. He was very fond of this art-loving, slightly weak Crown Prince, but did not find anything wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not that the abandoned bottle leaked the secret, he really didn’t know that Byron’s Chu Jun had a mental illness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
