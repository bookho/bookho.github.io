			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick clouds accumulate over the city, it is very dark early, until 5 pm, the dark and the haze are expelled bright, and the king is on the sky. The slight refraction of the faint glimpses on the edge of the clouds will soon disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A guest who just finished drinking the ale, squirting a stinking wine, rushing home toward the home, passing through the green In the agate square, he hit the person with a top-heavy weight, and heard a whisper that secretly suppressed the anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold...sorry..." The drunkard snarled, vaguely glimpsed, a young woman wrapped in a thick turban. I am getting up from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl glanced at him, licking his broken arm, sideways to make the crossing, and continued to look at the signage number on the roadside building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, miss...I, can I help you?" The man took a nap and came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"East Five Street, No. 117..." The other party chanted, she obviously could not adapt to the poor street planning of the old town of Feidu, illegal buildings, alleys Dead lanes, the right path blocked by garbage, and the shortcuts that are worn on the walls of abandoned houses make it easy for people who are not familiar with the terrain to get lost. It is not reliable to walk along the road signs. It is very likely that you have just passed the old number of the three streets. The road passed through a few bends, but found that he arrived at the four-street recess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This messy and dirty place." The girl pulled the hair down irritably, and screamed at the drunkard. "Roll, stay away from me." "She walked away quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drunkard screams with ambiguity and continues to hurry. He suddenly touches his head and thinks of something. "Five Streets, No. 117? Good familiarity." Number?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he turned and looked back, the woman had disappeared into sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The home is a famous savage house in the old district. There was a case of annihilation in the past." The drunkard was foggy. "Since the last tenant has been rumored." After moving away, it is ruined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is an unexpected emergency, come to the old street, the slogan of the old district. It is absolutely safe." Casimodo looks like sincerely Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't believe him, that man is very dangerous." Julian is full of thousands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Missy’s mind, both of them are loyal loyalists who deserve to rely on, but now, she feels that it is difficult to adapt, and I don’t know who to believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faded big sign, the noise from the door reveals that business is booming, and a bar on the road has caught the attention of Peggy. She felt that at least the small land would do an investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Golden Goose? Vulgar name." She shrugged and pushed the door and went in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hostess came up and looked at the new guests strangely. It was a place for drunkards and men to have fun. Very few girls came alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A cup of water, just order to eat." Peggy looked around and was surrounded by a group of sluts and drunken male monkeys. She found a corner away from the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospitality quickly brought the plate over, half-boiled sausage, toast, canned bacon and cold water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I just came to work for a fee. I found a rental house." Missy said. Passing a ticket for a small denomination, "But the road is really hard to find, maybe you can help a little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Entertained and smiled. She stuffed the banknotes into the half-slipped shackles, and she was happy to make extra tips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"East Fifth Street, No. 117."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the Green Agate Square to the left, Crossing the two streets, I went to the Fifth Street," the guest replied, "Well, how many numbers did you just say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"#117"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy found that the other person's face was not good-looking. He asked, "What's wrong with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that no one would be willing to rent that building again. "The reception whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please elaborate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entertaining mysteriously, "Old people Everyone knows that there have been murders there! Nearly residents have been evacuated, and they are not suitable for a single girl to live alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can pay Deposit." Peggy fell down with peace of mind, Feidu old town staff mixed, plus a building that has been bad rumors, leading to no one is willing to approach the building, is indeed suitable for temporary hiding place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must have been deceived by the real estate agent!" The reception sighed. "Good luck, I hope that Mr. Flair's ghost will not climb you in the middle of the night." The bed, licking your neck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Peggy almost stopped beating for a moment. She felt that her breathing was rushing, not because of the fool's superstition and fear of ghosts, but about the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fryer?" She said in her heart, barely said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s the victim of the murder." The guest explained, "The man is a prosecutor. It is said to be a small aristocrat. He is quite famous in the old district. I married a girl in our bar, but unfortunately, the good guys don’t live long.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy’s face turned white, her mood was boiling like a fire. Burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be scared." The hostess thought sympathetically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is an enemy! Casimodo is the enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pei Ji’s heart is full of indignation. The shelter he provided to her is actually the former residence of Fran Fryer’s monkey. This is no coincidence. It is ** naked mocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like she framed Fran, let him lose everything, and eventually he died, Peggy was alone at the moment, without wealth power, lost friends who could rely on it, Step by step to perish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East Fifth Street, No. 117, is the grave designed by the enemy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intellect tells her how far it is to leave the fee immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she didn’t want to escape. The anger and frustration made Missess want to get out of control, and the rational threshold was closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come on, I will face you, I will figure out who you are, will fight with you, courage is my shield, anger is mine Sword, whether you are a ghost composed of resentment, or a conspiracy who is guilty of ignorance, I will not escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is in a hurry, like stepping on the fire, around the bustling square, through the dark lanes, without stopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is going to explode in her chest, calling her a wounded lioness, fear, anxiety, despair, and wild savage anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to torture the enemy, what tricks do you play? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to abuse the enemy and make him awesome! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to kill him, cut his flesh with a knife! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to pray to him, let him tell himself, is Fran Flair still alive, or, is he? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night makes everything in the world turbid, boring, depressed, ghastly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peji stopped the pace a little, looked up, carefully clarified the old and fuzzy cards on the door skirt, and slammed into it without fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come out, get me out!" Missy called, the floor was squatting under her feet, the dust of the zenith and the spider web in the corner, in the snoring Trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She searched, the tattered main hall was nobody, the rough and dirty kitchen was nobody, the narrow and dark corridor was nobody, everything was dead, sinister Like the interior of the mausoleum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl didn’t know how many laps she had, but she was exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally felt tired and sat down on the steps of the stairs, leaning her head against the wall and burying herself in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** is very tired, but the spirit is very exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally cut her happiness and remembered a long-awaited event. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years ago, Tantin, a splendid, luxuriously decorated bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛丽安走了, "The news came from Feidu, Igo Andech just did the murder, the name is Fran Fo Lyle’s former prosecutor died.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy shakes his hand and closes the book he is reading, full of horror, “Who asked him to do it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe private hatred, but..." Julian observed the hostess's face. "I have heard rumors, you are right there." Mr. Flair has a good feeling?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How could it be, do you think I will fall in love with monkeys?" Peggy sneered. "The monkey is not good, I refused my friendship and died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, although Andre is only a family servant, but I believe that the Duke is not I hope to punish the loyal ministers for this trivial matter." Julian sighed. "I am really afraid that you will make unreasonable bad behaviors that affect the evaluation of adults."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will only be happy." Peggy stood up straight. "Don't talk about the monkey, go to the hot water, I want to take a shower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a hot steam in the bath, and the rose petals float on the water. The lady is lying on the back of the hot water, comfortably closing her eyes and sighing in satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fran Fryer, I am so happy, although I kindly let you live a path, but your despicable fate still makes you miserable It’s dead.” Peggy’s lips were tight and slightly curved, showing a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But your brain is so clever, you can't say that you are not dead. The idea has passed the Andy's stupid pig."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the more you want to Maybe, you are still alive and alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy licked the water, poured it on his face, what was in the eyelids, the water ran down The flushed face is flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unlucky, you are alive, it really makes me sad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never believes that she is crying It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she opened her eyes, she was still in the dark. "I actually fell asleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Peggy thinks that she is trying to stand up, the numbness of her calf loses strength, and almost let her roll off the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shallow sleep made Missy’s mood much more stable. She walked through the gallery and went to the empty room. The paper stuck on the window was ruined by the wind and rain. Everything is left with only a few fragments of yellow on the back of the window frame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out of the window, the night is already deep, there are not many lights, the whole city is like the jungle under the night, quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘎嘎..." The door that was decaying and deformed downstairs, and the harsh sound of the floor rubbing, someone visited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy suddenly turned around, holding his breath and listening carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people stepped on the steady pace, stayed in the hall, then climbed along the stairs, getting closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes are in a line, waiting for the ending and answers of all the stories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: Hey, the story has finally reached this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran finally got to push Peggy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
