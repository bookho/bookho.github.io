After the performance of the invitation by the royal family, it must be able to achieve career. At its peak, some of the drama critics’ public comments are like traditional knights, writing love letters for noble and entertaining, from Nicole’s acting voice to Lauren’s script, without any praise during the Gulf tour. The Cardinals even occupies the front page of several famous newspapers. The titles contain words such as "excellent" and "unusual vocals". It is said that the reputation of the troupe has been passed to the earliest foreign ministers of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Barry Silana walked down from the car with a pair of small leather boots tightly packed with two slim feet. This woman is born with nature. There is a temperament that makes men crazy. As they grow older, maturity makes this charm less attenuate, but it is more graceful. Although she has retired from the scenes and is no longer involved in performances, the long-term exercise is a beautiful step of the dancers, attracting everyone's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the St. George Hotel personally came to greet him. "The head of Sirana, I am honored that the group can choose this store."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are welcome." Baru's hand was handed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the kiss, the owner suggested, "Maybe you and the stars can take a moment to leave a print on the celebrity wall of the hotel." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the arrival of St. George VII, the hotel has started a new tradition, and every celebrity of the accommodation will be asked to print their own print on the colored clay. After the mold is molded, it is packaged and hung to the wall of the second floor salon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the celebrity wall, we can see many well-known big people, the highest of which is of course the first Emperor St. George VII, as well as the former Minister of State and several prominent Dagong, master artist, Wenhao. This is one of the most outstanding scenery of the hotel, and it also highlights the taste and status of the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am such an old woman, you can ask Miss Julie." Barry said Nicole's surname, laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, really. Your charm is more outstanding, really don't consider returning to the stage? I saw the Gulf News describing you, but I’m amazed at your acting skills!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, this group of hypocritical guys. Barry laughed and smiled, but shouted in her heart: Who have you seen my performance? When I stood on the stage, who else have you paid attention to? My golden age passed in obscurity. Ok, now I can't play, you call again, please come back. Just because the troupe has money, it is famous. What you see in your eyes is not talent, not real talent, but Barry Silana is the head of the Cardinals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-term support for the troupe's tiredness, so that Barry's nephew and legs have appeared to be a big problem, she can not sing high notes, can not insist on high Difficult long-term action, this young and talented woman can only stand behind the scenes. Look at the boys and girls who are more fortunate than her. It glows on the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried to suppress the expression of indignation and smiled, but the idea of ​​"why didn't support the game at the beginning" bit her head. She feels sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consultant who arrived at the hotel first came out. He greeted him and said to Barry, "The head of Sirana, Sir David Knight is waiting. You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bo Knight? Sir Alex?" She is inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He claimed to be one of the shareholders of the troupe, I have heard you mention it." The consultant explained, "It is Lord Kasimodo Knight. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barui licked his mouth and blocked the exclamation, and his look turned from euphoria to doubt and into anger. She stood for a while, and said indifferently, "It is him, I will wait for him to settle accounts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you looking for? I owe you money?” Nicole just got rid of the people who requested the signature. The red-haired girl of this young girl is still enthusiastic, and the red dress similar to the hair color makes the girl seem to be a beautiful fire. She has taken over the head. Arm Bay, asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, go eat first. The hour of dinner has been a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just lose weight, eat less, nothing.” Nicole saw the head face wrong, secretly spit out the tongue, then pulled the consultant aside and whispered, “What happened?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mu Li squad leader, Quasimodo. Lord Knight is in the hotel, but the head of the team seems unhappy," the consultant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big man! That guy has disappeared for almost two years." Nicole reveals a strange and weird expression. "Wait, you mean..." She widened her eyes and stressed, "Lord?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but the title of a foreign country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good guy, how many things did he marry us?" I can say with anger, "The liar!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dining table in the restaurant on the first floor was laid out within ten minutes, with the black caviar pie, Chicken and mushroom meatballs, cheese meringue potatoes... The dishes were presented, and the hungry troupe employees took a seat with a happy expression, but some careful people found several vital figures in the group. They all seem a little nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barui is chillingly cutting the pie with a knife, as if the dish has a deep hatred with her, Nicole Julie is snickering, as if looking forward to In a comedy show, Lauren, a manager of the drama class, whispered a few words to Nicole in a strange voice. After looking upstairs, he looked upstairs and quickly called a waiter and asked him to take him to the second floor. Salon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren saw at a glance, on the left table, the tall figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, old friend, I’m thinking about giving you a punch or hugging you first." He shouted excitedly and walked over. The other party smiled as well and spread his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am back, old friend." Fran muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commotion at the stairway attracted Fran’s gaze, which was half an hour later. He just introduced Lauren to the Viscount and talked about speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pui Rui, you go to arrange the room, escort the soldiers' rooms as big as possible, continue to leave at noon tomorrow; Nicole, pay attention to inform the staff that they can't be in the middle of the night Going out, there are several local celebrities invited in the morning, you are going to prepare, but don't be too late..." Barry walked, and as the generals issued various concise arrangements, she went to Fran In front of him, his eyes did not look at him. He first politely greeted the Viscounts and then turned to the playwright. "Lauren, your new script, don't you have to change it?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicole stretched out his head from behind the head of the group, looked at Lauren sympathetically, and told Fran with his eyes. "You are finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren makes a fortune Blue ear. "Old friends, you come to cope, the woman in the hair is not sensible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Excellency, I am sorry to bother you, the troupe is a little private, need a Knight Mr. went to deal with it.” Barry said, then looked at Fran, “Gregory. Can you talk privately?” Her voice was sweet, but the anger of the brow could be refined, enough to burn a dragon. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barryi Sirana’s single room is in the middle of the fourth floor, and the entire four floors are covered by the cardinals. The people in the corridor were members of the troupe. They secretly used the corners of their eyes and looked at the glamorous head. They walked into the room with a strange and ugly big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Murray squad leader, who is he?" They asked Nicole behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't gossip," Nicole said. Then shouted to the waiter. "I need a glass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter was excited to talk to the big star face to face, he said with great respect, "Miss Julie.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want tea or hot cocoa?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, empty is enough." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really gossip." Lauren seriously condemned, "Eavesdropping is a very impolite thing."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get it, don't you be curious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but unlike you, a playwright needs to be inspired at any time. With the material."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren called the waiter, "Please bring two empty glasses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fighter's Foreign Affairs, Fiera, looks at Nicole, who is always graceful, and Lauren, who is known for his poetry. Bumping his buttocks and squinting, each holding a glass on the door of a room, concentrated on the inexplicable things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rubbed his sweat and hurried to the stairs, blocking the two artists who wanted to visit the troupe. "I am really sorry, we have been driving for a day, it is very tired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the box office in the future. Never let them see this unsightly scene. Perry’s management shouted in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of St. George's most luxurious rooms, with a brown studded sofa and a glass countertop with a variety of small crafts. The deep-coloured hand-made carpets and the curtains of colored silks make the space full of rich colors, and the various wines on the walnut wine cabinet are full of eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a bottle of wine from the cupboard, put on two high-legged cups, filled the wine, but never talked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran looked up and hanged the hanging chandelier on the ceiling, and the pale yellow squatting beside the lamp, "very beautiful room." "I think, live. Not as good as the old iron bed houses, but there is no way, these are also one of the troupe's advertisements. If you want others to believe that you are a star, you must behave like a star, eat fine food, drink pure wine, Living in a luxurious place." Barry said, squinting, the hair of the cloud hanging on the right shoulder, "You should say something other than this room."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, my lord, you don't need to be sorry." Barry's nephew seems to be shining "The money is what you left behind. There are a total of 154,162 pieces. You are the benefactor of the troupe. Without the money, the cardinals are still a wild team, and they are suffering for tomorrow's expenses." What a bizarre story, a troupe of a troupe, a temporary takeover, suddenly disappeared When he reappeared, he had already put on good clothes, put on the title of the Lord, and talked with the upper class. How can I understand it? The son of the incognito, who lives in the name of God, saved a bankruptcy troupe like God, and then quietly Retreat? Ha, the fairy tale in reality, praise it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more she talks, the more excited she is, the dance, the alcohol, the emotion, the whole face They are all dyed in intoxicating red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually, I am because..." Fran is about to say the prepared rhetoric, but was interrupted. "Two roads, either, I put the money." You, plus six cents, we will never owe each other; or, please give me a promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
