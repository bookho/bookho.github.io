The body kept hitting the rock walls on both sides, and the flesh and blood were blurred. He seemed to be able to hear the bones licking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unimaginable pain caused the girl to almost bite a piece of meat from her lips. She desperately endured, shrinking her head, so as not to hit her head, and the swaying gradually slowed down. She gasped and looked down. The remaining height was enough for a seriously injured person to die on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hands are getting less and less strength, she can't hold on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Life characteristics: Extremely weak... Weakness search: Nine fractures... Within three seconds... Make muscle fiber and fat layer more Elasticity..." Put his left hand on his chest, her eyes blackened and the ability to use, while releasing the other hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two seconds later, she was lying on the ground of the dusty soil, coughing, the girl thought, and then the eyelids became heavier and heavier, "If you can wake up, you must Go to the head and tell him that the enemy is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can wake up...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, you slept for a day and a night." Lauvita slammed openly, and she saw a pretty woman with a very exaggerated chest, standing on the edge of the bed with a bad color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just go to the mountains to inspect the stone, but actually made this look." The head of Baru seems to want a disgusting expression, but she saw After seeing the other person’s naked bruises outside the clothes, I couldn’t help but slowly relieved. “The doctor has checked and re-wrapped the wound. I broke a few bones for at least a month. Inside, you have to stay in bed as much as you can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Lauvita remembered. She was not dead yet, but she walked out of the mountains alive and, after a little treatment in the town hospital, rented a carriage to Tantin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is painful to walk through the mountains, or endure the bumps of the carriage, it is a nightmare-like memory. When I think about it, she feels that the skin is tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautetta slowly tilted his body. Looking around the room, she only saw one big and one small two strange women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Barry Sirana, Casimodo ... partner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am who I am..." The orc girl rushed to the bed, revealing a very cute smile, "Cecilla, Are you a big friend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big man? Are you talking about the boss of the Knights?" Lauvita remembers the name used in Tantin. "I am his subordinate, or a friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Cecilia nodded. "It is another person who can't eat." She thought about it with regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, no. I mean the boss? I didn't see him." "Casimodo went to the limestone mountains to find you..." Barrie was shocked to see the girl's face changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a few days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not less than a day. Estimated to be halfway and You just missed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Moore is currently in the capital city, I mean the head of the construction team, let him come."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you worried about?" Barrie shrugged inexplicably. "I will go here. Right, I have to open the meal. If you are injured, just eat it in your room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6:30 pm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautita Whiteman is not interested in the food at the table. She changed her clean clothes and fiddled with the knife and fork. Mushrooms. Moore can catch up, she comforts herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Casimodo doesn't care about money, really loses money, won't blame you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about, the room is comfortable. You want to live It doesn't matter for a few days until you get a good injury."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are injured because of work, so medical expenses and after-the-fact subsidies will definitely not be counted. "In contrast to the silence of Lauvita, it is the chatter of the head of the Baru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita tried to suppress her fears in her heart, she raised her eyebrows slightly, Casimodo? The woman in front of her eyes dared to call her name so affectionately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the lines, she is clearly intimate in the declaration of her head. Like a squatting bitch, warning others, don't invade your territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, what are you responsible for in the construction line?" Barry continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is internal to the company, and outsiders are not suitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"瞧Say, although I don't care about the construction line, it is one of the partners of Quasimodo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s weird, the boss said to me, But I have never mentioned you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the table is filled with a chilling atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the team put down his fork and snorted. "You are just a small staff member, know what."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Lauttata Whitemane squinted, did not answer, but there was a hint of dangerous light in the eyelids, so that Barry had some fear of no reason. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I met Quasimodo, I didn't know where you are fooling around!" Barrie dazzled and disdainfully thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that there will be troupes who think they are very beautiful, and they don’t let go!" Lauvita said in a sad heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Cecilia, who doesn’t know how to be a human being, feels the twisted tension between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong with them, you look at me, I am staring at you." The orc girl strangely asked for a good meal, Lauren, who was sitting on the sofa and flipping the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are still young, don't know how. But this is the best learning opportunity, you will face it sooner or later." Lauren uses the recited sonnet The tone of the voice, gently said, "Hey, the poison of the power, the arrogance of the incense, the monks also kill people. This is the war between women."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rui Silana sat in front of the dressing table, crouting and looking at herself in the mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightly protruding cheekbones and soft cheeks all have an elegant silhouette, and the full lips and the big eyes under the eyelashes are brought to her. It’s fascinating and fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few faint wrinkles in the corner of the eye, which makes her more mature than the little girl. The charm and charm that comes out of the bones, like alcohol, requires time to accumulate in order to be just right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now is the time to brew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, a week after the royal wedding, I feel that we still need to prepare?" Nicole pushed in and then looked at the bar The set of navy blue satin turtlenecks on the core, as well as the light makeup on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makeup is it at night? Nicole thought strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it beautiful?" Barrie stroked the tiny crow's feet, took out the chalk, and gently covered them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie can set a confused brow, "How come this suddenly?" She turned her eyes and said with a smile, "Our head of Silana, But the cardinal is a great beauty. Hey, it’s a honey that can make a man sweet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What a messy adjective." She glanced at her, and said in her heart, "At the age of thirty, I can go beautiful, and people are still a little girl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole I feel that the head of the team has a different feeling from the usual. She sneaked out of the room and found Lauren. "What happened? How come back from the big man today, Barry is nervous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
