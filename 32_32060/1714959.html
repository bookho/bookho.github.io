			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience is enchanted, applauding, shouting, tears, and the fire of the drama makes all the hearts burn, the petals and the confetti are flying. That little yellowish and deep red, hovering in the tent, slowly falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran stood on the stage and recited the last line, the light of the corner of his eye, saw the samurai girl, his voice stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the canopy was extinguished at the moment, the tent was dark, and people still shouted, waiting for the lights to be bright again, and all the actors came out to the curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, it was a human form under the slightest firefly. The girl walked cautiously toward the stage with firm steps, her sword, pointing to Fran . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there is a light, "identify the evil," the girl whispers, in the darkness, Fran's body is full of halo, then, boiling, flame-like bright red There was no variegation, the girl was a little surprised, she looked at the kind red light, and the arm of the sword was shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan stands, he stares, his heart beats wildly, his mouth is dry, his head keeps thinking, what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience was first silenced, and the frantic sound almost shattered the eardrum. Everyone thought that this was the new drama code. "The special effects are great!" they shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran went down the stage and came to the girl, "Redemption, this is the messenger of heaven!" He shouted in the tone of the stage play, and the audience was more excited. I decided that the new plot came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He whispered to the girl, "Who are you, are performing now, if you want to send me flowers, please come to the background after the end." Also looked strangely The glow on the body, "What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...is a person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Miss, of course I am a human." Fran laughed. He had to bet. At the time of the sewer, the samurai did not see his appearance. The Master’s potion, although useless, at least covered a few non-human feature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl suddenly smiled freely. "You can't lie to me. That feeling, like in the waterway, the ice is cool and calm, only the undead creatures will be This taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran didn't know that the samurai had a wonderful sense of being able to observe the existence of undead and unclean things. When he turned, a powerful arcane masked this, but now he can't stand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord said that only if there is a righteous person, it will not be destroyed, we will be saved." Fran turned and shouted to the audience, and people responded enthusiastically. He, "The righteous, save."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is very consistent with the plot, the regaining of the knight, the sudden emergence of the heavenly messenger, better than the previous end The theme has been sublimated and everyone is very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil, you are not worthy to use the holy scriptures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you want to be here Open the killing ring? Hey, Anno's holy warrior, do you have evidence that everyone in the room, there is no good person?" Fulan forced to calm down, "Give me some time, I will go with you to no one's place, He made a knot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the background and vaguely said to the head of the team, "a little personal matter." Then, pick up the canvas hanging on the back door. , ran outside the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, we can play another game, you..." The head of the group did not finish, and another figure chased it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barui opened his mouth and swallowed the rest of the words and asked Nicole, "Who is that girl?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows." Nicole said anxiously. "It won't be a woman who was abandoned by a big man before." What to do, I will call you back soon."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just wondered..." Matida bit her lip. According to the truth, she should not hesitate to pierce the heart of the devil, but for a few words, she could not get it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This devil, it really is the path of heaven to test her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run! run! run! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan regrets that human intelligence is really limited, and many seemingly perfect strategies should be completely out of order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He runs along the river, and he doesn't care about anything. He just wants to get rid of the evil star behind him. At the moment of day and night, there is a thick lead gray between heaven and earth. He hopes that when the sky is completely dark, he can The wilderness outside the town fled into the barren hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escape! escape! escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seemingly huge and clumsy body, running fast but extremely light and swift, Fran has the potential to play, like a raging horse, no half In an hour, I ran out of dozens of roads, and the people were very rare. In the distance, I grew up in the deep forest, fled in, and blocked the chasing of the samurai by the cover of trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the forest was approaching, the flame suddenly spread on the grass and trees in front, blocking his way. The white cold fire did not ignite the plants, but As soon as Fran was touched, the muscles were immediately melted and slowly re-growed, but his body's ability to repair was far less than that of the bishop who was fully supported by the Eternal Cabinet. The pain of the internal organs was almost fainting. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan couldn’t move, fell to the ground, and Matilda prayed, and the flames became more and more boiling with her pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She used the sword to reach the back neck of Fran, and as long as he used force, he could cut his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the face of absolute power, little cleverness is just a symbolic resistance." She said, "Repent, devil."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why." Fran gasps, every time he speaks a word, a white flame is ejected from his mouth. If it is not the remnant power of the sacred object in his body, it has already become a holding of gray soil. "I have saved you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please confess, your existence is a sin in itself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan laughs hoarsely, surprisingly angry, and has not confronted the real enemy, he has to die in the hands of a fanatical believer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His vision is blurred, more than the pain of enduring the limit, but let the body float, "If you can be smart, if you have more power Point, then..." He said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light spot swayed around Fran's body, but the color became more and more bleak and was swallowed up by the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
