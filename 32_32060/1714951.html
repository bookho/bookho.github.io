			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farther away from the fee, the more natural the nature is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roads on both sides of the road are gradually becoming scarce, and the solid asphalt roads are slowly turning into roads that have been trampled out by humans and wheels in the grass for a long time. After a series of staggered crossroads, the endless fleet of cars gradually went their separate ways to plan a city with oil and water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jun Xiao, really don't want to go with us?" The girls on the caravan smiled. "At night, let the three girls accompany you." "It's also."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, beautiful lady." Fran answered immediately, he just bought a horse from this troupe, the boss was not willing to sell However, after seeing a ticket, I was not willing to immediately become enthusiastic to sell, and finally attached a full set of saddlery and a small bag of black beans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran also bought some food and Flint, and spared on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse is very old, it should be over 16 years old, the eyes are sunken, the back is sinking, the teeth are not worn, but the feet are still working, and the thick cockroaches are turned over. Mao, can see a fuzzy mark on the shoulders, Fran recognizes that this is the mark of the Clydesdale bloodline horse produced in the Anglo-American Principality. This Hummer skeleton is huge and can pull amazing weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that after it becomes a prototype, it can move me back." Fran patted the horse head with gusto. "You will call Luo Nantes later." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few opportunities for urbanites to ride horses, so Fran’s riding is not superb. Fortunately, the Klezdale 驮 horse has always been known for its spleen temperature, in the Spurs and the Reins. Under the traction, Luo Nantes ran smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenery is beautiful, surrounded by large green fields, the breeze stroking, the decaying yellow leaves of the green grass that have not yet become mud are blown up, half-man The high air is turning, the far end of the line of sight, the manor and the village at the hills reveal a vague shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More, it’s like a virgin, hillside and woods that haven’t been reclaimed, crunchy green and blue sky with round clouds, let the line of sight enjoy Extremely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a small-scale tour group like the Cardinals, there are not many cities to choose from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the remote country, there is no profit at all. In larger cities, except for several festive festivals every year, the small theater company has no foothold, so the town of moderate size is the main source of income for the cardinals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran and the head of the group made an appointment to meet at Dawn Fort in the west of Fedu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a big town with a population of 20,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the transformation on the 7th, Fran didn't want to waste it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s four o’clock in the afternoon, and two and a half days to let him do something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecutor’s professional experience enabled Fran to master many of the information in the underground world near Feidu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is ready to follow the coastline towards the northwest and go to a market town called Sara. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officially, Sarah is a small salt-producing salt field with coarse salt. At the same time, it is also a temporary stoppage for smugglers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market town is just in the middle of a small arc bay on the coast. This natural port boat is free to enter and exit, encounter the Guard’s search, and sail to the far sea, such as The glass of water poured into the sea, without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran needs a little bit of news, and when it comes to the most informed information, who can compare with the private ship of Nanbei? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The climate of spring is uncertain. In the evening, the cold wind on the head constantly takes away the body temperature, making the riding speed slower. The dark clouds make the night drive two hours earlier. The bell, the lightning squanders the endless energy, the stunned thunder is like the roar of the giant in the ear, the beautiful natural style is shuddering and fading in the light and the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a downpour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wilderness of Byron, you can often see the broken wall debris covered with moss, which used to be the sentry tower and military station left by the war, with the conquest With unity, they lost their value and fell into ruins in the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of luck began to care for this suffering person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the woods not far from the road, there is a sentry tower. The walls of the rafts support the towers that have not collapsed. Fran took the horses in. They did not fall completely by the rain. A large pile of fallen branches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cold rainstorm, hot food and warm bonfires are more effective than prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used a piece of brick to build a rough wind barrier in the corner of the wall, the fire just burned, and the heavy rain brought the gloomy and horrible world to the world. The wind was worn between the bricks, and Fran was more careful, and the fire was not destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bread and bacon that were carried were half-heated on the flames, and Fran poured a black bean in his hand, and he remained quiet and calm. The horse's head came over, and the wet big tongue rolled up the beans, making Fran's palm itchy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain may be in the middle of the night, and Fran hopes not to delay the trip. He half-closed his eyes and fell asleep while throwing the branches into the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame heats the air, and the light refracts into a swaying shadow. Through the fire curtain, the wall, the collapsed half of the spiral staircase, the broken wall and the straight raindrops The bushes are all blurred and twisted...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the footsteps of the puddles that make Fran wake up from his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly touched the suitcase, and put a lot of dead branches into the bonfire that was extinguished quickly, watching the direction of the voice with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beast? Still people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps stopped outside the whistle tower, and then, a thin figure that drenched the chicken, pulling the same wet, constantly snorting horse, Come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came to see the fire." It was the voice of a woman. "The rain is too fast to find a place to shelter from the rain."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please come over." Fran stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another flash of lightning, the fleeting white light made Fran see the face of the comer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an acquaintance, he saved her; and she passed him a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of a childish face two years ago, she became mature, and the white-red knight suit and the shawl cape were soaked, tight Sticking to the body, full of feminine temptation, because the cold, white skin is like a transparent, she hesitated, hanging the sword on the saddle, the horse to the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boots must be filled with water, and every step of the way, you can hear the sound of smashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warmth of the fire made the girl breathe very comfortably. She opened her palm and placed it on top of the fire. After a while, she saw that Fran was still standing. Sorry to move to the side, "Sorry, sir, I am too cold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter." Fran took out a pocket Seal the small iron bottle and throw it at her. "Drink some wine, then use the wine to rub your hands and feet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl hesitated, probably Fran's The appearance is not like a malicious thief. She said thank you, unscrewed the bottle and poured a few mouthfuls. The spirits let the girl squat and coughed her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms.... Are you a knight?" Fran asked inadvertently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, yes, you can call me Hepburn." The girl said, "I am going on a tour, sir, what about you?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Hepburn, you can also call me Toboso directly. I am a businessman, and I am running around for my livelihood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ceremonies are a traditional ritual of the Cavaliers who have been given a name and traveled around the country to grow their knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Anno’s holy warrior will come to Byron to tour? Fran does not believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The samurai girl, looking at Fran, the temperament of your son, is more elegant than every nobleman she has ever seen, without the market of a businessman. And few merchants will walk alone in the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robbers who robbed the family were not alone in the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are very few female knights, it must be very hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the way the knight practiced, Mr. Toposo, I did not see your team. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small business, where can I get the team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They both doubt each other, Explore the details of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to admit that not only the body, Ms. Matilda Hepburn’s thoughts and cognition have matured a lot, but still not as old as Fran, no How long, Fran's talk, let the girl's suspicion fade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...a piece of home-baked loaf, sold directly to the street, it is worth only half a silver coin; but if cut into small pieces, wrap a beautiful ribbon, If you sell to a dieting woman, you can sell five silver coins; if you make a rose cross shape that represents love, sell it to a love lover, ten silver coins can be earned, profits, not depending on the actual value, but means..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theory of endlessness makes Madida dizzy, she is completely convinced that this Mr. Toboso really regards money as glory and future Speculator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, your knowledge is wider than me, can ask, inquire about the news, what place should I go?" asked the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The patrol halls of big cities will be happy to help women like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, it’s not official.” Matida vomited and blushes for herself. “There is an illegal agency that sells information...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Miss, that’s Fallen and dark places are not for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please forgive, there is indeed a hard time..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran thought about the pros and cons. Finally, he promised, "Starting in the morning together, my destination is exactly the place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Thank you very much." Matida whispered that she felt hot from face to neck, but as long as she remembered the path of heaven, the monster that should be hiding in the world, the girl did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
