			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Four years ago, Roland not only failed to recapture the sacristy, but instead buried it in the deep underground of Feidu, the meaning of the eternal cabinet to the Holy See. Significant, even if only half of the debris is left, it should be found in the holy city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anno is responsible for all the repairs, only allowing the emperor to kneel and giving us the right to act freely," he suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a big project, road damage in the past ten miles, and the underground waterway has completely collapsed, and it is necessary to clean up those stones weighing up to one million tons. One year." Coming from Tantin, the envoy of the Emperor's Royal Order said to him, "Your Majesty has given Ann's most respected rituals, but even the Holy Order of the Holy See cannot be stationed in Byron. For too long, the economy of the Gulf region relies mainly on ocean trade, and the presence of holy warriors will undoubtedly dissatisfy the Eastern merchants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Say, the great emperor's favor for the pagans is far better than the friendship with the Holy See?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too much, the Holy See should Respect for the independence of the country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anno has nine knights, and there are millions of believers in the country's educational countries. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Byron did not dare to question the influence of the church in international politics, but free trade and Political independence has long been the consensus of the countries in the circle, and Byron also has nearly 100,000 well-trained fighters and powerful navies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, the rhetoric between him and the envoys was put aside the false veil, and the naked land threatened each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joan VIII seems to be ironic, to get the wreckage of the sacred objects, and to study ways to extend life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will be mad in the face of longevity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If time can return for a hundred years, Anno will never allow this day's offense, but the pope issued a command, the kings shouted, formed a crusade crusade The era of the enemy has long existed only in books of history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very disappointed with you. Lord Archbishop." After returning to the Holy City, His Majesty the Pope said to him indifferently. "I thought I could personally dress a new red cardinal with a sacred robe." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, all the clues now, as well as the head of the Matilda, have shown that the reading of the gods Rio Angut has been buried in Fees are underground." Roland is sweating. I want the pope to think of myself and still contribute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is why I didn't take you to the country and go to the small hall to spend the rest of my life." The pope suddenly sighed. "In fact, no matter what The blasphemy, or the sacred object, are nothing, and Angus is no longer arrogant. After all, it is no match for the power accumulated by the church for hundreds of years. The eternal cabinet is just a glory, I need it most. Yes. Use the way to control it.” The religiously noble old man shouted in a burning tone, “then.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seal of light can only Reappearing the glory of the past, the king is on the city of Wannian!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his hand, "Byron is one of the most powerful countries in the circle. At present, the church can't help it and it completely tears the skin. However, there is no need to worry about what the outsiders can learn from the fragments of the sacred objects. Sooner or later, the eternal cabinet will return to our hands."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pulled his thoughts back to the ceremony. He once again tidy up the folds on the robes, lifted the silver sacred plate by hand, and came to the ceremonial table in the side hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that person, a potion that will scream something, the Ingmar, named Casimodo Bo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doubt and disdain of the potion are hidden in the bottom of his heart, he walked over with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the kingdom of heaven bless his children." Roland smeared the wine on the forehead of the other. The choir, then sang the songs of Zhuang Mudi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless rose petals on the indoor balcony on the second floor of the Central Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran felt the head start to faint, the spirit together with the exhaustion of the **. Let him sleepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President’s Speaker came over again and placed a scepter engraved with the Knight’s family crest in Fran’s hand, and then announced loudly, “... I am a singer, with the command of the Emperor's Majesty, and the testimony of the Annomian and the present, the cycleon of Kasimodo, officially became the Earl of Byron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;After the ceremony, Fran barely talked with the people who watched the ceremony, and then frowned slightly. In this kind of social situation, he would be the main character, he would not leave in a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he can’t hold on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fran politely bowed to a curious Marquise and walked quickly toward William. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Congratulations, you must be the count, it will be very helpful to you." William made a look that you know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope so, but there is something more urgent now." Fran said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master also found something wrong from Fran’s face. “What?” he whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be going on, I have mentioned it to you, already two times, I fell into deep sleep." Fran answered, "I don't know." The symptoms from where it came out are coming up again. But I don't want to let too many outsiders know, and I can't ask a doctor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Kate The Viscount came over to Fran, and he smiled and said, "His Earl, you must enjoy your face this afternoon and participate in a championship Marseille held by our Pegasus Club."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Your invitation, I shouldn't have refused, but..." Fran looked at William. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am working with Casimodo, I am preparing to discuss an academic matter." William told the deputy director. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Kate did not know the Master, he asked questioningly, "Academic? Can you please..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is not Mr. William?" At this time, a senior official of the Security Department shouted, "You are here too." He explained to the viscount, "This gentleman is a famous magic master. Not long ago, the Security Agency, because of his help, found the instigator behind the scenes from the maddening assassin’s mind, that is, the Zhuofa Longqi who is currently wanted.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount suddenly realized that he had heard a lot about William’s rumors. In the assassin case, even the court magi, Berry, had to seek the help of the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
