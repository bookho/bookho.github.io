			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.If a god uses the unobstructed insight to look at the brains of Fran-Frell and Peggy von Como, he will find out The two are very similar, clever, deceitful, stubborn, logically meticulous, know how to use external forces, be proficient in jurisprudence, act in a unique style, have the brilliance of genius and conceit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the twins in the mind structure have nothing to do with the character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stems from the morality of the two who run counter to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethics is a wonderful emotion. It makes people get rid of barbarism and break away from obscurity. For example, the god who created the heavens and the earth separates good and evil in the human heart. The sage produces a sublime beauty because of it, and the villain gives it a rancid smell. It can't be seen like the air, but everyone can feel its existence. If the order and constraints caused by morality are lost, the whole society will be chaotic or even collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not the ones who have the self-defense tendency of the 16k novels, nor are they compassionate, and are willing to bear the sages of the world’s suffering with meager self, and tend to Realistic self-interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Peggy arrogantly tramples on ethics and thinks that it just doesn’t go to the weak to try to protect his illusion, in the girl’s vision, the famous family, The cities with high buildings and splendid and solemn countries are no different from the wild jungles and even more cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the jungle, morality, compassion, and love are the poisons of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan recognizes morality, knows to show humbleness to this stalwart, sticks to the last point of high, when he makes the case for Peggy, for the case When there is a tendency to be unfairly judged; when he is in the eyes of others, it is an opportunity to be envied, and his heart will feel struggling and painful, like the burning of Mars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it was because of this bitter pain that Fran eventually became himself, not the other, with the Peggy of the East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is no hug between them, only hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference in this source is not noticeable, at least in the eyes of Julian Sivagna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her new owner and surveillance object, the same kind of person as the hostess, likes to be alone, good at thinking, elegant etiquette, but there is a kind of indifference that refuses thousands of miles away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little maid was just driven out of the bedroom by Fran at the moment, when the man pulled the light and found that the young girl was lying on her big bed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing? I said without permission. Don't arbitrarily enter and leave my room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Warm bed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warm bed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you let the owner sleep directly Into the cold quilt, but I lost my blame." Julian said with the pure and weak look, the half of the nightdress sling is sliding on the elbow, she explained, "According to the oriental tradition, this is One of the rights that the owner should enjoy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of suggestive teasing, with a pure expression, full of spicy temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran frowned. He knew what the girl wanted to do, just searching for luggage. When he was inspected, he happened to be stuck in the room. But is it necessary to justify this ridiculous reason? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bent down slightly, revealing a strange face that was made to smile, and used the index finger to hold up the chin of Julian. Kindly, "Please go out, or get out, the tone is different, but the meaning is similar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛丽安 has been trained by professional agents, can The subtleties reveal the truth hidden behind hypocrisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wise man can't leave suspicious places in the big picture, but the impact of life is indelible, they are in daily manners The Chinese General will make this life branding manifest, and if you disguise it, it will inadvertently reveal flaws. Imply that he has experienced things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At 6 o'clock, the Lord of the Knights gets up, every day he wakes up at this moment... very familiar with the oriental customs, the credibility of the adventure experience Very high... Foods prefer sea fish dishes. They don't reject shells and cuttlefish. This is how people who live in coastal areas will maintain their taste. Inland people rarely eat scaleless fish...” The girl recorded, Too harsh on yourself, not close to female color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spent a long time in the coastal city and I am a strict man. Julian commented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of getting along is too short, and I don’t find any unreasonable things. I still need to continue to observe. The girl thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that the Lord of the Knights is not as loyal and trustworthy as it is, she will always find out the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collection of Black Swan Castle is like a treasure showcase, with rows of brown six-story sandalwood bookcases spreading straight across the polished boxwood floor. Next to each row of cabinets, there are exquisite triangular ladders for people to get the top books. Listed in the cabinet, you can let the most knowledgeable scholars sigh in the depths of the chest, Saiya's hand rice, Russell's sonnet ban, and Hemingsky's full set of works first printed, no Less treasures are even rarer to see the National Library. These literary collections are worthless and cannot be estimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wonderful taste of paper and ink is faintly adorned in the air, and the soft light shines through the multicolored glass window embedded in the zenith. Come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is the only private library in Byron, which is obviously a symbol of taste by the original owner. It is hard to find books to find Looking through the folds, there is even a vertical piano on the side of the hall. The people who really love to study and learn are most tired of being disturbed by the noise and the intense collision between the words and the brain, even if it is melodious and soothing music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Fryer quietly shuttled between the cupboards, occasionally stopped, took out the book, stood and watched for a while, he touched a set The book spine of the full-color law books, this book is grand in content, explains in detail the practical use of each article and the classic case analysis, and the comments of the legal experts at the end of the page, the number of pages is quite amazing, the whole set has Sixteen books, stacked almost half a person high, when he just became a freshman in the Seventh Street Court, he dreamed of buying a set, but the comparison of pricing and meager salary meant that he had to spend half a year on money. The premise is to eat only two meals a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still remembers that in order to save money, he spent a few hours every day standing in a high-end bookstore with a tasteful taste. Back to the ground, and then when you go home, record what you deserve to be recorded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one occasion, when he was stunned, his shoulders were patted and turned around and he was one of the bosses of the bookstore. It was a gentlemanly demeanor. Scholars with white hair and gold-rimmed glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you like them very much?" asked the old gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah. It is very helpful to me." Fran was blushing, although the bookstore allowed customers to read it at will, but he did too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are almost no such professional books to watch. I have never seen customers like them so much." The old gentleman also took a copy and caressed the cover. Like the head of a child's hair, "A silver horn every month, no, five copper. How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, Fran is not clear. What does it mean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Knowledge only makes sense in the mind. Otherwise the most valuable book that records all the mysteries of the world is just a deadly effect." "The old gentleman saw the confusion of Fran and explained with a smile. "It is better to let a younger person who is motivated, and to enrich his head, instead of putting them on the bookshelf."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five copper, don't deposit, this kindness makes Fran in two years. Enjoy a hearty meal at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This. The young man who was involved in the judicial field was deeply grateful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every gentleman personally came to meet each time he returned the book. The two of them always stood in the hall and talked almost, and they almost became oblivious. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But one day, Fran, who was a prosecutor, went to the new case of the Seventh Street Court and found the name of the old gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a case of a wounded person. The old gentleman found that the partner had been secretly engaging in ghosts and embezzling a lot of common ownership. When the dispute was over, he was angry. Picking up the paperweights on the table and squatting on the partner's face. The iron foil paper wrapped in copper foil on the edge scratched the eyes of the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran was responsible for the allegations in this case. He first sent the partner to the prison with fraud, but he hesitated when he tried the injury case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a mistake made by a good old man when his emotions are out of control, not because of his intention, but the law only values ​​the results of the behavior, not because of the suspect. The character of the weekdays ignores the harm the victim has encountered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the victim is a real and despicable villain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe I can help this kind old friend. I will be acquitted." Fran thought, but this is selfish, will be human The private situation is placed above the justice of the judiciary. If every prosecutor does this, the legal majesty will be tarnished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t sleep all night, and in the second day of the trial, the old gentleman looked at Fran with his eager eyes, for a scholar who insisted on personality, Being imprisoned is a face-to-face encounter, which will make him faceless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fran’s teeth were sentenced to three months’ imprisonment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the minimum sentence for the crime of negligent injury. Afterwards, Fran also used his poor influence to try to make the other person feel comfortable in prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, but I have to stick to the principle." The old gentleman had a serious illness after he was released from prison. When Fran went to visit him, he explained it in a whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are right, don't blame yourself." The other person comforted him and expressed his understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they never came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the truth, the old gentleman does not blame Fulan; in the human condition, the old gentleman hates Fulan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran at the time was a stubborn stubborn person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did he start to change gradually? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beautiful face with a flying face emerges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hates this woman, but perhaps Fran himself does not know, in the deepest part of the heart, he recognizes her ideas, the constraints of human respect laws, but wait When the constraints came to their own bodies, they pursued the bias of affair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who puts justice in the first place will only accumulate more and more resentment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People live in the world, and they must always compromise on all kinds of things, smoothing the blunt corners and becoming smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The second page of the seventh book, page 183...is a legal interpretation of the case of revenge..." with a lazy hoarse voice Bringing Fran back to reality from his recollections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw Peggy squatting behind him, licking his hand and opening the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the humanities, when there are sinners worthy of sympathy, and ridiculous victims, the public will tend to pity the violent party, such as being harsh The employee who was treated, when recovering the deducted salary, used the dagger to kill the boss, but in the text, he could not deny the crime itself because of the experience and suffering he had experienced." Fran said that he cooked Remember all the case notes in this book, "You can have other opinions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy licked his hair with his fingers and said, "If From the perspective of the prosecutor, I support the legal nature of sin and punishment, but from a private point of view, I appreciate the revenge of eagerness and enmity. How much hatred he has imposed, how much I will repay, so that the gloomy fire in my heart can be calmed down. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Highness, you are right, I think so." Fran's closed lips smashed into a thin line, and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has become more and more like Peggy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren of Byron just followed the long corridor and came to the library in the other house from the main hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, she saw the castle servants talking and laughing while dealing with the work in her hands. She felt that almost every corner was filled with relaxed laughter. Everyone can find a partner with the same mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint sense of loneliness suddenly caught her heart, she couldn’t find the same person with the same idea, couldn’t see her can really understand her thoughts The servant respects her and fears her. Her followers follow her expecting sweet candy from her. Even her husband will only love her superficially. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, people are living creatures of the population, and she cannot avoid the instinct of nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I opened the door, Peggy looked at Fran, the ugly big man who seemed to be closest to the person she wanted to have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
