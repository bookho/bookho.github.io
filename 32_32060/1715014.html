			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The luxurious hall is full of guests wearing gorgeous dresses, and the uniformed servants keep sending a glass of iced fragrant vermilion or brandy. The ballroom is surrounded by a long table covered with white silk, with a lot of delicacies, pancakes made from small songbirds, minced beef pie, clove venison, candied oysters, and silver pots. A variety of soups, as well as marmalade and stewed chestnuts, rock sugar pears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all-roasted peacocks, after roasting, put the clean and beautiful feathers back on, this kind of food is not beautiful, mainly on the table Play a decorative role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past, there was a gentleman who had not received formal etiquette education. When he saw the roasted peacock, he tore a large piece of meat. As a result, he became The most funny laughing stock." Kate laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount is talking about a celebrity event that was widely circulated by Byron. The founder of the first bank in Byron was the landlord of the country. He came to the capital city and wanted to do a big business, but he did not know the etiquette and caused a lot of jokes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think this is deliberate." Fran said, "The bankers deliberately pretend to be clowns and won many invitations to the upper party, although the owner They all have the idea of ​​'making more jokes and letting us have fun', but these rare social opportunities have made him meet many great people who can help. When the bankers become famous, those stupid things become unrestricted. Anecdote of the section."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hah, very interesting insights." Kelly replied, "According to you, everyone was cheated by him at the beginning, really 狡猾The marketing method."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate is preparing to say something, the corner of the eye saw the door coming in, the court of the red robe, he said, "His Royal Highness." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the Crown Prince and his fiancée arrived, the audience cheered. In the speech, there was an episode. When Julius greeted and thanked the guests gracefully, it was the turn of Peggy. She simply said, "Bless you." The cold expression on the face did not match the festive content of the words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To this beautiful wine, congratulate the distinguished ladies!" A stylishly dressed aristocrat, holding a cup, said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was followed by a burst of cheers, all kinds of glass enamel filled with orange red and pure, lifted up by a hand, intertwined with light under the lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waltz is soothing and smooth like a breeze. The melodious sounds provoke people's minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first dance was played by two protagonists, and the crowd automatically vacated a large circle in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slut in the eyes of others, in the music, accompanied by the rhythm, danced. Julius is a handsome and noble youth. When he laughs, the whirlpool of his cheeks affects the facial muscles, making his expression soft and pale. From sculpture and oil painting, we can see it. Como the Great is a wide forehead. The eagle is hooked, and the king of iron and power is always condensed in his expression. But the blood is passed down to today, those who are determined. It has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright fire of love, lit in the eyes of Julius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the dance ended, he reluctantly, and even secretly complained why the song could not grow longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy has never danced with men in public, but it doesn’t mean she won’t jump. In fact, she jumped awesome, which in turn led to Amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran at the end of the crowd, looking at Peggy, there seems to be some intense emotions in the scorpion. He poured a sip of his mouth into his mouth. Use a cup to cover up the weird look on your face. The spicy wine entered the stomach, and Fran felt that the breath that he spit out was full of grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost couldn’t resist the anger that his heart rushed out, and the intensity of his anger made him startled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t worry, hatred is like the vintage of the kiln secrets. You have to endure the hardships of waiting, and you have fun when you drink." He used He couldn’t hear the sound and said, take a deep breath. Let yourself calm, calm to cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ball is over half, and another piece of music is over. The dancing people are scattered in the darkness around them, or go to the back court to get the air, or go to the table to get some food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still people on the dance floor, mostly young people who are passionate about communication. And those more politicians and dignitaries will not give up the good opportunity to contact with each other. The group of three or five will form a small circle and will give a warm laughter from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran believes that in this banquet, at least a dozen of the distribution of interests and political investment have been completed in private. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a provocation between peers, but as a professional, I have to say that the bank is not reliable, and their investment failed last month. , lost more than 600,000." Double Eagle Bank's director Elro waved, "Double Eagle is more worthy of your trust."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you I suggest that I will consider, maybe at the right moment, I can transfer the money to your bank.” Fran turned the cup in his hand and he turned his eyes to the corner of the hall. “Our Crown Prince, His Royal Highness, only jumps all night. "A dance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gorse is always so arrogant." The finance minister said that he found that he seemed to be overly exposed, so he eased. In tone, “maybe because of distress, we all know that Miss Reinschmann is the chief prosecutor of the Justice Department, and the case she is responsible for has encountered difficulties.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Difficult?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just happened to be clear about this case." The Finance Minister explained, "but because And the aristocratic House of Elders, the specific situation is not open to the public <br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "explain in detail what? "Fran asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the case is only the public, not our nobles and officials." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Finance described the matter in detail.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This case is the most recent The most troublesome thing in the Justice Department. Not long ago, a man named Benson, who filed a complaint with the aristocratic elders, claimed that he was the illegitimate son of a viscount, and that the viscount was a retired old officer who had just died, no wives. Sub.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson used clever words and realistic props, plus bribes, to let the auditor of the Presbyterian Church believe his identity and issued A certificate of recognition of status.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a servant of the Viscounts’ House, who used to know Benson, used this as a trick to get from the liar. Benefits.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liar didn't want to share the benefits with the outsiders, so the servant who was angry and angry reported his fraud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Benson played a trick, he donated a large sum of money to Byron’s charity, accepted interviews from many newspapers, and spent money on The front page of the newspaper news became the focus of Byron at one time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of the public, this is a charity philanthropist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many reporters are tracking the case where this philanthropist was prosecuted. The Department of Justice can only claim that there is no comment at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time. If the court immediately sentenced Banson to defraud the aristocrats and slandered him, it was undoubtedly a slap in the face of the elders and let the public know that the members of the elders were idiotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to conceal the embarrassment, the Senate proposes not to be guilty of convicting a liar, to stabilize for a while, and to wait for the public’s attention to be reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not prosecuted. The liar will sway and sway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s funny." Viscount Kate laughed. "For the sake of face, it’s better to be cheated and not snoring. It’s indeed the style of the old-fashioned lawmakers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran touched the edge of the glass with his fingers. He thought for a while and suddenly said, "Maybe I should go and ask her to dance and let the beautiful lady worry. But the shame of men."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How could it be that the lady never accepted the dance of others. If it was not a marriage contract.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe she will not jump today." The Finance Minister was surprised to advise, "In Tantin, even the most romantic Prince. Will not touch this mold."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And out of respect, there is a saying that he did not say - even the beautiful young man can not succeed, let alone your ugly appearance? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to try it, miss it." Fran smiled, put down the glass, and walked over. He understood the character of Peggy and knew where it was. Start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get rid of this boundless enemy, you must first approach her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Knight is crazy." Kate whispered, "Maybe this is the adventurer's madness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenge the most dangerous travel, dissolve the ice of the most stubborn woman The outer shell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large group of justice departments are surrounded by Peggy. With a gentle smile, Julius sat on the side listening to their conversation, because he couldn't insert his mouth, he looked boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, can you dance?" A beautiful lady with a roll of hair and long eyelashes, like a doll, is crowded with the crowd. Invited, she looked at Peggy with provocative attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the upper class of Tantin. Julius is the meditation of all aristocratic girls in the boudoir, the prominent identity, the appearance of a beautiful young boy, and Peggy, who is about to become his wife, undoubtedly plays the image of a witch who took the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to traditional etiquette, a gentleman can't refuse a woman's little invitation, otherwise it is a kind of behavior that is not elegant and polite. Julius looked at his fiancee uneasy, for fear that she would be upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go." Peggy didn't care, the expression on her face seemed to be a happy relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be jealous of stupid women who socialize and seduce men as charismatic? This funny mood never appeared in Peggy's mindset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, she doesn't love this little husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Julius was excited to pull the girl to the dance floor, the crown prince’s face was sullen and without a smile. “If you show a little bit of it, it’s fine. "He thought depressed." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The boring person has finally left, and now we can seriously discuss the case." Peggy said, "What good is it for the guy?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several prosecutors wiping sweat and calling the Crown Prince the boring person, indeed meet the consistent style and spicy tongue of the judicial tyrant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The current evidence is conclusive, the only difficulty is the face of the elders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to be stupid for the elders." Peggy shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't anyone find out that he had committed a crime before?" A prosecutor said, "We only prosecuted those cases and related to the elders." Ignore it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't take away the liar's nobility title, according to the aristocratic code, he only needs to pay for the previous crime." Ji said, "Then you can sell the property that you deceived and sneak out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the delay?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much time? Six months or one year?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cut him up and shut it off first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Banson has invited a number of well-known lawyers, and this road will not work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is the union exerting pressure?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s a stupid way. Many newspapers are concerned about this matter. How much is the scandal of the Justice Department not enough?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy is not willing to let this Impunity, we believe that this is not how the law impartially eldest, but she thinks he suffered a humiliating defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's actually very simple." The man's voice came over, and Peggy saw a tall and weird ugly man coming towards himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Miss is not looking at the ugly, "Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cassy "The Knight of Modo Bo, from Ingmar." Fran said, "I am very interested in the laws of various countries, only to hear about your distress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hah, it is a bad thing to pass thousands of miles. Maybe the entire Tantin, are waiting to see the jokes of the Justice Department."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you play with a little wrist, This case is not difficult to solve. It’s just that you didn’t expect it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Do we have to rely on the help of an amateur?” A prosecutor answered angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, listen to him." Peggy was very interested. "It makes everyone headaches, and a layman, but he said it is a good solution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The difficulty of the current case is that the elders are concerned about the public because they are not willing to admit their mistakes. Therefore, the crime of fraudulent aristocracy is not established in the official. Although you have mastered his previous crimes, but because he cheated The aristocratic identity can not be judged and imprisoned. Even the Justice Department can not lock him up, only to see the liar succeed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is so." Ji nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That, let's let him go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy was successfully squished Curiosity, "Let him go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, end this prosecution. Announce to the outside world. The suspect Banson is not guilty."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then, let the elders replenish the old prince iron lion knight medal And this honor allows the scammers to inherit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this suggestion? Are you a lobbyist of Benson?" The previous prosecutor was almost Howl. "He cheated to the title and hundreds of thousands of Caesars, and took the initiative to give him honor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it makes sense." Peggy understands Fran. The meaning of "the Iron Lion Knight Medal is issued to the warrior with military power, and the dead old Viscount, is the officer's origin. Therefore, the liar who inherited the Iron Lion Knight Medal, must nominally go to the military for a few months." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If a liar accepts, he has to go to the army, and he only needs to speak with the military in advance. The fortress he serves is equivalent to a prison. When will the public take him?" If you forget it, you will cancel his service period; if you do not accept it, it is a contempt, and the elders have enough reason to immediately capture his title."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "So, the Iron Lion Knight Medal is equal to being given to him temporarily, and will be withdrawn sooner or later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran and Peggy said one word at a time, with a tacit understanding . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it is very troublesome. But in order to take care of the monkeys in the elders' home, this can only be the case." Peggy's mouth swayed out of the beautiful embarrassment, this ugly man's cleverness and way of doing things made her feel very interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, can I ask you to dance?" François, made an invitation gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl squinted and looked at Fran from head to toe and thought about it, "To thank you for your advice, okay."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan glared at Peggy's slender waist, accompanied by the rhythm of music, spinning on the dance floor, a strong, big man, and a beautiful woman, like a beautiful woman and a beast in the drama. Bridge section. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you ever been to the East? I have time to talk to me, I am very interested in the culture of the East."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, this is my honor." Fran looked at Miss White's long slender neck, and the charming collarbone, "The game has just begun." He sneered in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have a lot of arguments. "Who is that person? I also saw him talking to you just now." Someone asked Kate, "He can successfully invite the disgusting socialite Prince."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Casimodo Boss." Kate is still in shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran’s pseudonym immediately spoke from one mouth to the other, and in a few minutes, almost everyone knew this by Ingmar Come on, the adventurer and the rich man with the title of Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the Red Bird Theatre is a big star in the performing arts, Fran is a dazzling star in Tandan’s social world tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the relationship, Fran was not regarded as a rival by Julius, the Crown Prince also entrusted the Finance Minister to convey a message to Fran, "How do you do it?" I have to teach me, oh, my fiancee is not welcoming to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one o'clock in the morning, the banquet is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran riding a horse and walking on the way back to the Heihe Hotel. He looked up and saw the sly moon shrouded in a faint cloud. The dark dark clouds are like a crow that predicts fierce beliefs, hovering in the night, silently screaming toward the city of Constantine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
