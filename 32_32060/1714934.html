			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the most important thing for a nobleman? It is not a luxurious costume, a superior horse-drawn carriage, a learned butler, and an invitation to a private salon, but represents the family's coat of arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inheritance of blood and honor is reflected in this little gadget. From the above pattern, you can guess what is the origin of his ancestors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a knight’s coat of arms is usually represented by powerful animals such as lions and wild boars, while the family of the civil servants, most of them are birds. And flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bird on the coat of arms is a donkey or a swan, there is a **, this family once had a member of the church as a senior cleric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple shield has three yellow diagonal stripes on the bottom layer. The middle of the pattern is a black crow, which is the home of Lord Flair. Family crest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran’s grandfather, a secretary in charge of intelligence in the military, earned him a pretty good reputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the military, the intelligence officer, after receiving the title, will often use the crow as the most conspicuous place of the coat of arms, the alerter and the deceased, the crow in the eyes of the world Has such a meaning. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, on the emblem of Lord Freire, there are some small balances, and the old prosecutors in the judiciary love to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, in the eyes of others, Fran is indeed a veteran of the judiciary. Although he took the position of a formal prosecutor only two years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a hard-line prosecutor who is solemn and majestic and can make suspects and lawyers feel uneasy without the slightest angry face. He is always quiet. Sitting on the bench, the face was filled with a gentle and shy smile, as if it was a freshman, the first time to see the big scene recorder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the words spit from the recorder’s mouth are mean, terrible, aiming at the soft underbelly of the opponent, then the stubborn prisoner, and then the defending lawyer. He can't walk a few rounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the lightning-shattering lightning in the sky, the little flames burning silently next to the fire yao library are even more terrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a trial is like an opera, Fran is undoubtedly the most dazzling performer, he dominates the emotions of everyone in the court, his words are like Infected with magic, both the audience and the adversary, are drawn with his pace, anger, sorrow, and joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he stood in front of Nazhuangmu’s trial desk, he was the omnipotent prophet, and it was hard to beat him in complicated cases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Fran, this is the nickname given to him by the staff of the Noble First Court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has guessed that in a few years, Mr. Flair will be the youngest prosecutor in the history of Feidu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement is derived from Fran's outstanding ability, but also from Reinschmann's support for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that Fran Fryer is part of the genus of the gorse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two years, at least fifteen cases concerning the interests of the gorse family, Fran has made a judgment that tends to his own people," Rein The loyal dog of the Schman family, the unscrupulous people call him that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any case, people who like him and those who hate him admit or have to agree that this twenty-five-year-old has a different age. More mature wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having just enjoyed delicious food in the restaurant, the guests gathered in the big living room with satisfaction, the group of twos and threes talked about it, and the dozens of waiters shuttled back and forth between the crowds. Occasionally, the guest took a glass of stomach-salted wine from the tray held by the waiter's hand, and then re-invested the spirit in the topic under discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all parties that are attended by the judiciary, the topic is naturally inseparable from the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of judges and prosecutors are interested in talking about a rare case that has just happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old district of Fedu has an area of ​​about five square miles, surrounded by streaked iron railings, which belongs to the dead place. In the past century, at least tens of thousands of dead people have been buried in this city cemetery. The old and new tombstones are densely populated like mushrooms coming out of the wetlands after the rain. The place is not enough, so we have to layer by layer. Stack buried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exaggerated point, just dig down from the corner of the cemetery and dig into the ground for more than ten meters, you can still see the shin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the church’s cemetery is magnificent, it is only available to the wealthy believers who can afford the price, the ordinary citizens of the capital, who can provide it to the deceased relatives. Only the thick coffin and the cemetery as close as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three weeks ago, this place that provided a resting place for the citizens, like the big horses in the garden It was messy and broken, and countless bones were dug out from the ground and covered with all corners. No one knows whether this is a prank or a prelude to a disaster. The sad people can't identify the bones of the earth that belong to their own relatives. They have to work together, dig a big hole and bury them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter is not over yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And two weeks ago, the riots began again, this time the church’s sacred cemetery, when several nobles were seeing their father’s When he was hanged on the spire of the railing, the anger flocked to the patrol team that did not find any clues. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that Inam’s inspector, after not sleeping for a few nights, glared at all the bloodshot eyes and yelled at the big man who came to exert pressure, “Also let I slept; either buried me alive in the graveyard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s terrible, I think there’s a pervert."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, fortunately, our family's family cemetery was not harassed. After this incident, I immediately asked ten night watchmen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;" After the investigation by the patrol team, a strange theory was put forward: from the postures of the cheekbones and the traces of the soil in the tomb, the bones seemed to wake up from their dreams and climbed out from the ground several meters deep. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, the inspector is addicted. Since the famous midnight butcher murder case a few years ago, he declared that it was the devil, and now I have to admit that there is a dead soul, but I have to admit that this is a good speech, pushing everything to supernatural factors without any responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next time I will open the court, I will confidently say to the suspect: 'Although there is no evidence, the saints of the trial came to my dream the night before, and told you about the crimes you committed, so We are going to burn you'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecutors sneered at it. Anyway, the work of arresting the prisoners for evidence was done in front of the patrol hall. They were not too hurtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the prosecutors are also men, and the topic of men is of course inseparable from women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the big lady of the Golden Sparrows is often the focus of this topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the focus is sitting next to the Chief of the Court of the Aristocratic Court, Count Carmen, seemingly intimately talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s dress is very casual, the white ladies’ suits and trousers are no different from the usual courtroom, just put the ponytail always behind the head. It’s down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to see, Peggy. Don. Reinschmann is not a standard beauty, although the facial features are exquisite, but the lines of the face are too strong, the mouth is often Hanging with a mean smile, the action is also big and big, and the eyes are so fierce that people dare not look at it. But these shortcomings blend together, but it produces a wonderful beauty, as if she is born to be suitable for "free and easy" and "handsome" and other men's vocabulary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the circle, many people who think they are the right person to the door have once pursued an overwhelming pursuit for her, but there is no result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, people have not found Peggy with a close boyfriend, except for the two-year rumored actor: Fran Fryer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When talking about Peggy, inevitably, I have to involve Fulan, and I’m going to talk about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guy who climbed up by sexual ability." This is a vicious evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least a smart person." This is a neutral evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s still a handsome guy, it looks like a weak attack, and it seems to be a strong one." Hey, this is a kind of biological love evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan stayed alone in the smoking room next to the banquet hall, licking the delicate outer appearance of the corrugated cigarette clips, and wondering if it would come again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since his cigarette addiction has risen to the point of two packs a day, An Mei forced him to control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method is the cigarette clip in Fran's pocket, only seven cigarettes are allowed per day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Seven is a good number, the legendary day of light creates the number of days between heaven and earth." An Mei stressed with nothing to emphasize, "I don't want you." It becomes full of smog, so kissing will turn into a torture that is painful and suffocating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one cigarette left in the clip, Fran is uncertain The idea is to enjoy it immediately, or stay until you sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are guilty of smoking, you can't sleep for a good night. Like a small bug in his heart, it makes people feel restless and uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have been here for half an hour." I don't know when, Peggy found the smoking room, and looked at the smoke with a disgusting expression. The room protested, "I need to ask you for something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please say?" Fran frowned and it was not an interesting job to deal with Peggy. What the young lady appeared is usually the compromise of power and interests, and the compromise is self. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these made Fran feel helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushing open the window of the smoking room near the balcony, Peggy stretched her head and took a few deep breaths, letting the refreshing air dilute the smell of the room, she yelled Sitting on the border of the window, it is clear and concise, "The Chamber of Commerce hosted by the Viscounts of Ayres is facing a dispute between him and his partner about the ownership of a 100,000 gold Caesar. The hand is obviously farther away from the pile of gold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This should be the responsibility of the commercial court."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The identity of the nobles of Lord Ayres allowed the first court to take over the lawsuit, and the gorse has been grateful to the Viscounts for their kindness to the family, and hopes to pay for it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, I have to put a little bit of dirt on my reputation that is not innocent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't complain like a child, the monkeys will be close to the darkness of the night sky." Missy disdainfully glared at Fran, "seeing honor as life, observing virtue , Exist only in the story you will not be naive to believe that there really exists Saints it "<br <br /> & nbsp />;.. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Fran sighed slightly and finally made up his mind to ignite the last cigarette. "I will do it." He swelled like a long, snarling tooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a satisfactory promise, Peggy changed the atmosphere and changed the subject. "Why didn't you bring your playful little mistress?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is not suitable for this kind of entertainment. Also, she is not my mistress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, attend At the meeting of the upper class, An Mei always clamored to come and see, but after a few times, the little wild cat regarded this as a horrible experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I really don't know how to communicate with the noble people. They said that I can't plug in my mouth, I can only stand from start to finish. Aside, I want to be a smirk. I want to be in the eyes of others. I am a gimmick who has just come from the country." An Mei was crying, and the cumbersome etiquette, the latest fashion and taste, she could not learn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she carefully went to Fran and asked, "I won't lose face to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I can't adapt to the atmosphere, so every time I go to the smoking room to pass the time until the end." Fran comforted her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei was nodded with the same sympathy and then sympathetically announced, "If you go to the party later, you can bring two more cigarettes."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy looked at the big eyes like a joke, and looked up and down Fran in the top and bottom. "Hey, you don't really like the country girl." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please pay attention to your tone." Fran felt that it was time to end the conversation. He stood up and put out the cigarette butts in the glass jar. Ready to leave this objectionable room. "The country girl in your mouth is about to be my wife. I hope that you can attend my wedding in a friendly manner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This girl makes him feel all the time: he and she are not all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These big people always look at everything around them with a condescending look, mean and arrogant, as if they are the masters of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A fiancee who is a prosecutor is actually a prostitute who has worked in a pub. Please believe that you will become the most funny joke." Peggy sarcastically said, "especially, when you are a colleague, It was discovered that the bride in a wedding dress was actually a few years ago when he used a few copper pieces to buy chuang’s shackles.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran’s body seems stiff Then, breathing heavily, as if to breathe the burning heat in the chest, he slowly turned back, deliberately suppressing the emotions to make the voice hoarse, "Please do not interfere with my life, madam, although you Love this thing. Allow me to say one more thing. In my eyes, you are no more noble than others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guest in the big living room whispers, strangely watching The most promising prosecutor in the rumors was stunned and left without stopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran went fast, almost trot, and suddenly he felt very tired and just wanted to go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The home of a warm fireplace, warm atmosphere, warm people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third floor of No.37 Ram Street is lit with lights. Just climbed up the stairs, the keys have not been picked up, and the other side of the door is coming. "呜呜" spoiled like a low voice and the claws disturbed the sound of the wood on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened, and An Mei headed out her head. Only two months old little black dog Black Jack got out of the gap and shook his tail at the foot of Fran. Circled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today’s banquet is very early." An Mei’s charming green eyes have a question mark. "I knew that the bread and soup were put on the stove in advance." You must not have enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grandma?" Fran asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Asleep, the old man can't sleep." An Mei put her finger to the front of her lips and made a small gesture. Immediately, she understood the blessing. Why did Lan ask this question? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sofa, there was a storm, and the small living room was filled with thick spring se, but it was infiltrated from the throat. Jiao Yan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, you are crazy, don't wake up grandma, let's go back to the room." It was hard to break the tongue of Fran, and Anmei gasped and protested softly. But apparently the appeal was dismissed, and it was another stormy kiss in response to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Jack glared at his round eyes, and "Wang Wang" screamed twice, and then the eyes of the hostess screamed and scared the tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The damn little thing, go back to your nest, or you will stew it tomorrow." An Mei took a look at the little milk dog, helplessly in the bottom of my heart. Intimidating, she trembled, her body was covered with flushing, trying to resist the growing pleasure and not letting herself make a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the same damn big ball." Hold the lover tightly, Anmei bites him, and then looks forward to the storm. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leinschmann’s luxurious carriage slowly along the gravel road Going forward, Peggy's angry expression has faded from his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy has always remembered what she regarded as truth, and for the superiors, there are two ways to control others: whip and candy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whip lets them remember who is the master; the candy makes them, willing to kneel under her feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she has been unable to really control Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it too kind to him?" Peggy thought. The man actually insulted her with the kind of look of disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A district prosecutor, she has at least ten ways to make him fall to the bottom of the endless abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Fran, Peggy has always had a mood of ignorance, she appreciates his wisdom, appreciates his ability to be confident in court, step by step Introduce the opponent to the performance of the trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handling smart people and letting them dance as they wish is no doubt a more fun game than teasing stupid monkeys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fun toy, if you can’t obey it, is no different from the trash that was thrown away on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pei Ji had a dog when he was a child, and he was sensible and sensible. He only listened to her alone, and stuck with her all day, and did not separate for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
