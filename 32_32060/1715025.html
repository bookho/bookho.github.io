			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Tantin's upper-class circles know that Quasimodo Bo, the famous Ingma rich man is an elegant gentleman and savvy businessman It is also an adventurer with a legendary story, but at the same time, it is a strange and strange person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although at various parties, he is not very close in private. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time you see the Lord, you will feel that his manners are in line with the most perfect etiquette, but a deeper interaction will reveal his attitude towards you, Never be ignorant, neither will be particularly cold, nor will you be a confidant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord never hired a servant and a housekeeper, but occasionally asked several domestic helpers to clean the housekeeping company. Since the sympathetic sick daughter was sent to the nursing home, he was the only one in the big room. Every night, the lights of the house Qiu are always faint and gloomy. Only the black stenciled sashes faintly reveal a slight candlelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when the old friends of the Cardinal Troupe visited, the atmosphere of a luxurious mansion like a mausoleum was quite angry. For example, today, the table is full. With a steaming home-cooked dish, Nicole took the exquisite pastries and teased Cecilia with a bad taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Send my sister, I will give you food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mitida is the sister You are a few years older than her, it should be an aunt." Cecilia said innocently. The red-haired girl looked depressed and pulled the Lauren writer who was talking about the literature and art with Fran. "I am very old-fashioned? I want to know that a young girl in her early twenties is an aunt, but she is very hurtful." Hey. Hey, aunt..." She shouted at the stage full of accusations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cecily Asia Pacific is not sensible!" Lauren gently held Nicole's hand and said with indignation, "How could it be aunt? Appropriate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Fran saw that the girl screamed with sharp claws on the face of the man with a lot of mouth, leaving a few shallow blood marks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Casimodo, come to the kitchen to help me." Barry Silana gathered around her apron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orange flame leaps in the fireplace, and the tin cans are hanging on the fire. Inside is a milky white fish head seaweed soup. The head of the group sprinkled the roots of Hugen and the salt. After mixing evenly, add a small spoon, pour it at the bottom of the bowl and blow the heat with the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What can I do?" Fran asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Taste the taste, the taste is not light." Bally handed the bowl to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taste is very delicious, the fish head is burning. Let the soup have a wonderful taste of semi-colloid. Fran remembers that in the past, cooking was only ordinary. She is best at cooking white eggs and vegetable salads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great, your craft has improved." Fran said sincerely, "How do you practice?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When a woman reaches a certain age, she will become friends with the fire and the kitchen." Barry blinked proudly. "This is a magic that belongs only to women." The head of the team certainly would not say it. In her free time, she enrolled in a salon training course in Tantin's salon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Seduce a man, first seduce his stomach." This is a very cheesy advertising word, so that the money is very embarrassing. I did not hesitate to pay 60 yuan for each class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fish head seaweed soup is the first course taught by the training class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she belongs to the kind of woman with a slow taste. When other students began to challenge the Malkö Palace to stew the waist of the sheep, Barry was still practicing how to match the proportion of the seasoning in the fish soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Silana, you are too wasteful." The mentor of the training class. A famous chef and foodie, distressedly watching the expensive oriental spices, shamefully in the hands of Barry, became a "poison" that is difficult to describe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three lessons a week, Barry finally learned the practice of this fish soup after wasting a dozen ingredients. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic?" Fran is inexplicable. "The soup is already good. Would you like me to go out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You are really a piece of wood. I didn't see our big playwright and Xiao Nicole. Is something wrong?" Barrie said mysteriously. “Just like the common mantle relationship in drama, maybe the troupe will have a couple of stars.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I often see them quarreling about trivial things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the mood, the wood won't understand." Lan glanced at the aroma and white smoke in the kitchen, waving the spoon in his hand. "Give them a little more space, so you are honest and I stay here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"暧昧!" Nicole looked at the small diamond watch on his wrist, and his face smiled silently. "The head and the big man have been in the kitchen for half an hour and have not seen it yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Lily", Lauren shouted very seriously Nicole’s surname, “Are we supposed to give them space to be alone?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nic immediately understood the meaning of Lauren’s words, she scraped Body, whispered, "But I am still hungry, really slipped away now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Silver Street has a restaurant, is launching the Tulanka style Package."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You treat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms., you earn more money than me More."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not a gentleman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compared to being a rigorous and boring The gentleman, I am more than happy to slaughter you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cecilia put a strawberry jam biscuit in his mouth and looked at the strangely Faces are getting closer and closer, and they whisper each other in the ear. "Do you want to kiss?" she asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolutely not!" Lauren and Nicole turned their heads immediately, pulling away far enough, and replied in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still some flesh, what should I do?" Barry confuses the meat on the plate and makes a rotten meat? Day, until now she still can't tell, how different from peppercorns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am coming." Fran said that he looked at the sauce on the kitchen counter and skillfully sliced ​​the meat into slices and put it on the bread. Roll a few rolls in the crumbs and throw them into the pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meat flakes turned golden in the boiling oil, he picked it up with a colander, forced the remaining oil, and sprinkled with diced green onion, ginger and indispensable orange peel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The craft has not been lost." Fran smelled the fragrance and thought with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't find out, your cooking is so good." Barry screwed a small piece with her fingers and threw it into her mouth, praising the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I only have fried meat strips."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A craft has been quite good. "Barui has a real experience, she is the fish head soup," maybe, one day to give up the troupe, can go to the street to open a small shop, the signature dishes are fish head soup and fried meat. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran was silent for a few seconds and smiled unnaturally. "It's time to open the meal, they shouldn't wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one in the hall, on the table, the teapot is pressed with a note, and the plate is pressed. Put it aside, rub the hand on the apron, and pick it up and read it. "The Knight. We took Cecilia to eat the Tulanca. You can eat it for dinner." The signature is Lauren. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the note is also written in a small line, from the handwriting is Nicole added, "Head, you don't have to go back to the Heihe Hotel at night. Oh, yes. Go and prepare a few candles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Where did they go?" Fran carefully placed the jar full of soup and saw Barry blushes, smashing her hands and throwing them into the trash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are starving. Going out to eat." She replied calmly. At the same time, I thought, "What are the candles?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if answering her doubts, the chandelier on the zenith. It began to turn dim, and after a few flashes, it went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restaurant is dark, only the faint silver glow that the moonlight penetrates through the window roots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably the magic crystal energy is running out." Fran looked up. "There is no spare at home, I went out and bought a few pieces back."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't have to be that trouble." Barrie smiled and vowed to repay Nicole tomorrow. "Where is the candle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pleasant candlelight dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what I am thinking?" Nicole Julie angrily took the napkin off and looked at Lauren. "I’m hungry for three more days. I I won’t eat Tulanka, and the coffee is so hot that it’s awkward.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The taste of the pork simmered cake is not bad.” Lauren argues, “Dining is like living, you have to know how to find fun.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey, did you spend dozens of Caesars... Cecilia?” Nicole suddenly What I thought of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cecilla is not going to the bathroom... days, it’s too long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp A quarter of an hour ago, the little orc girl was soaked in tears by the spicy curry and ran to the bathroom to wash her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this point, she has slipped out of the restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia misses the taste of Ma Dida’s sister Bai Yan. There is nothing better in the world than pure energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Matidda was sent to recuperate because of illness, she was like a pouting child who used to eat a big meal, dismissive of cheap food. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hungry, and the appetite was ruined by curry, the girl was restless. Since the owners - well, our small Cecilia has always been a pet - and do not have the best responsibility, then only to go for food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tracks the previous goal, a middle-aged man who has just left the restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person’s body has the taste of dragon veins, and is more delicious than a hundred cream puffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man watched the vigilantly. Of course, he did not notice Cecilia, who was lurking in the darkness. The man touched his chest and turned into the execution ground of Tantin. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The execution ground is the famous monumental building of Tantin. The Judicial Office is traditionally, and at the end of each autumn, it will always be here to execute a group of sinful death row prisoners. But most of the time, the execution ground is open to visitors to watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hammering, twisting, guillotine, countless horrible punishment laws always let the Tandin people boil, worship violence, and always be the dark side of the human mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of years, thousands of prisoners were executed here, and the square was full of dark red marks that could not be cleaned. Blood, struggling souls, and this ancient building dissolves into one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark square, the empty building, the jungle of cement and steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night is the forest of Cecilia seed hunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it early?" The middle-aged man sat in the step-by-step auditorium. He belonged to the contact person of the most mysterious organization of Tantin. , get in touch with agents in the underground world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the big night, staying alone in the execution ground, the wind passing through the gap between the bricks and the tiles, making a strange sound, as if the ear is also echoing the tragic whine . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man frowned, he was not used to the atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there is a faint footstep in the distance. He looks down the sound and sees a petite figure in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pretty little girl, wearing a lace princess dress, the white skin is covered with a faint rose blush, with a small head and a yellow-brown I looked at myself with my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man walked over, was about to ask, heard the angel-like girl, lovely and very smiling, she showed white teeth, wet tongue licking her lips, "You smell so good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that any uncle, without any mental preparation, heard a lovely little loli When you say this, you will have wonderful thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle painted male perfume, is it really good?" The man sniffed on the back of his hand, waiting for him to notice, in the gloomy In the group of buildings, the little girl who appears strangely, this is worthy of vigilance itself, it is already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city at night, the noisy streets, no one heard, in the empty execution ground, when someone’s flesh and blood was plundered, a heartbreaking Screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
