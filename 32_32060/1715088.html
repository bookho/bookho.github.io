			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The giant boxing contraction forces, temporarily disbanding the ordinary sailors involved in smuggling, these men who are greeted by the sea, although they dare to despise the authority of the law, do not mean that they dare Faced with the full-scale sweeping of the authorities, the key moments will only be self-defeating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan brought together the remaining small heads that did not fall into the French Open, a total of 19 people and five speedboats with various types of passes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total value of 2 million bonds, jewellery and cash is loaded with dozens of large boxes and shipped to the dark ships in the boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Man, I don’t care about everyone, the organization is now suffering a lot, the police and the maritime patrol, looking for us like a mad dog, to avoid the limelight. Let's go together and organize a place in Portugal and Holland for up to a year. When things are no longer urgent, let's turn around. As long as there are people, it belongs to me and still belongs to me!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has caused a riot, and each head has a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you give up the interests of the organization in the Golden Horn? If we go, there will be other gangs occupying this blank, and then I want to get it back, but It’s hard to add.” Little Biss believes that he is deeply trusted, and he boldly suggests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to stay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the head gives me this opportunity, I will lead the leftover The next brother, keep the site, will not let any outsiders get touched, only to come back to you." Xiao Bisi seems to be loyal to say, but my heart is thinking about ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan sweet grinned, his face full of relief, he patted Little Biss’s shoulder and grabbed him with one hand, shouting loudly, “瞧Oh, this is my good buddy, the pillar of the organization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of bone cracking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small neck of the small Biss was cruelly broken, and the neck bones shattered into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You fucking want me to be a bait to attract the attention of the police? Do you secretly take over the channel?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When the wind is calm, do you come to be the boss? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every question, Kregan slammed hard on the body that was still wide-eyed, with an incredible expression, the iron horseshoe at the bottom of the boot Stepping on the bones and making everyone faceless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who else wants to stay? "Kregan's fierce screams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heads are silent, they are mostly locals. For years, the benefits and dividends brought by smuggling have made them There are a lot of industries in the bay.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandon everything, follow the big man to the unfamiliar Portuguese, and this boss does not talk about feelings, Even the brothers who brought out from the west in the past did not let go.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody wants to end up as miserable as Little Biss.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as he dies, the police's clues are broken and we are safe. "Every head thinks so. But no one wants to say it first.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan clenched his fist angrily, pointing his gun to his hitter. Threats, and the confidants brought by the heads, also raised the weapons in a reflexive manner. This move brings an ominous chain reaction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, ten guns Pointing at each other's key points.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people have their own sweat on their foreheads.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Kregan discovered that it is very stupid to use violence unless it has an absolute advantage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night falls, the cold moonlight Let the rippling waves shimmer with a pale gleam of light. Look at the sky. The heavens and the earth are wrapped in a faint black and blue.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty private The ship hangs half of the sails, keeps moving at a constant speed, and the people on the deck are stunned. In the boat, the commander stares at a device that is "beep...beep...". There are two small spots on the ground screen that flash in tandem, red represents the current position of the wearer, and green is the tracker on the ship.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"From the target six nautical miles, thirty nautical miles away from the island of Zieg. There is no abnormality, the signal is normal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still twenty-five nautical miles, be vigilant." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goal is still six nautical miles, and so on, the goal gradually deviates from the trip to Zig Island." "What does this mean?" The maritime patrol Lieutenant asked, personally instructing the inspector of Lime. Touching the chin inexplicably. He meditates, wants to speed up to catch up, and is afraid that the target vessel is a small problem that is temporarily lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten minutes passed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half hour passed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tracked ship is getting more and more off the expected course, and then the red dot on the screen stops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oops, is it another place, he is going to meet directly at sea?" The inspector slammed the table with regret, "all ships are full of sails, to the maximum Speed ​​forward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly gathering clouds. Blocking the moon, let the gloomy atmosphere more quiet, east of Haide City, in a hidden arc of the island, quietly moored several boats, on the simple dock, there are mixed footsteps. Two gangs with various guns on their shoulders were carrying heavy boxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a raised wooden board at the pier, and it was unreasonably stumbled over a gunman who was carrying it. He lost his balance and even took people. The boxes fell together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰", a large box weighing dozens of kilograms squatted on the slide, almost rolling into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, can't you be careful?" Another companion who acted as a porter, snarled annoyedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God knows how so heavy!" The gunman argued, "Don't blame, there are a lot of boxes, don't delay the time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his head and wanted to lift the box again, but the movements solidified. The slamming slammed the lock on the mouth of the box, revealing a small gap, like a smile in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few stacks of bundled large banknotes slipped out, and there were more inside. The gunmen knew what they were carrying, but they witnessed this huge wealth and brought him a strong impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Light this box ticket is enough to make a comfortable life for a lifetime." He whispered, feeling that his throat was like a fire, so he kept swallowing his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the boss's money." The companion groaned, but his eyes stayed on the money and he was reluctant to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be honest, the boss has lost power, saying that he is preparing for a comeback, but we have gone to Portugal, and we don't know if we can come back."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, really can't come back, what should I do with Xiao Anna I met in the city bar? I and her are good."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, now the ship is in front of you, no one is paying attention to this side, it is not as good as..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are all sweaty, right Look, slowly nodded. He lifted the box in a hurry and ran towards the nearest boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the speedboat sailed quietly. When heading for the future without knowing the future, several figures appeared slowly at the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just let them go?" In the gray eyes of Lauvita, the light of coconut blossoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Greed, people will become crazy, what future is waiting for these two thieves and betrayers, who knows." Fran answered, he Wearing a black lapels trench coat and white gloves. The sound calmed down, "Go, go see our old friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia holds the neck of Lauvita with both hands, half asleep and half asleep She yawned and was dissatisfied. "Let's fix it, so that I can go back to the bed. I don't have enough sleep, it will make the children grow up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private ship will enclose the target layer. Inspector Lyme looked at the dark ship with no light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart passed a shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suspect ship deviated far from the normal waterway and entered a water filled with reefs, hitting the sulphur. A lot of sea water was poured in, and it was sinking a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea police rowed a boat and boarded the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one was found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The tracker is still on, indicating that the other party is still on board."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, We were teased, and he found out that he had just changed out of Hong Kong and changed another boat.” Inspector Lyme answered, he stood in the driving, on the steering wheel fixed in the direction of the iron bars. I saw the ring worth 430,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a piece of paper under the ring. He picked it up and read it. "With this little gift, I will give all the heroes of the patrol hall." A firm and honest agent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end is covered with a crow-shaped seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frenzy gunshots, but then subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Fryer stepped into the nest and felt that he had seen hell. Blood, broken meat, bitterness, mourning and despair, he snorted, not for the scene of this disaster, but for the invisible. Helium and dark cruelty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugliest side of the person is presented to him, without trust, without temperature, without dependence, and at the last moment, the brothers and sisters of the brothers and brothers, but when they are in distress, they hate each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is too much blood, on the corridor, on the wall, along the window, and in a row, like the sewage flowing through the city's underground waterway, giving off a stinking smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save...Save me." In the aisle, a man grabbed Fran’s trousers, he was hit by a shotgun, and his chest was broken. Sponge, squirting blood from the bullet hole, "I don't want to shoot... everyone just wants to live and enjoy..." His voice became weaker and weaker, and then his hands were soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With Cecilia out, I have no need for her strength." Fran whispered, "The unpredictable justice of the world, just tried It’s over.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actually, I don't mind, nothing great, the little scene is gone. When I was with my uncle, I saw much more." Orc Loli showed off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't mind, but you should learn to stay awed by life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swings his hand Pushing open the bullets and smashing the holes, swaying the swaying door, crossing the corpse of the cross, and many faces he has seen several times, all the gangs standing on the side of Kregan . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint breathing sounds, the pain is unbearably coughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran stopped and saw Kregan squatting against the wall, bloody, with a gunman’s body at his feet, in a critical situation, a big fist He pushed him in front of him, blocking the death of the gun, but there were still a few fish that slipped through the net, biting into his flesh and smashing his lungs and stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crow...you are still here." Kregan spit blood, and the bleak eyes suddenly screamed, "...you won The rules are like this, the winner enjoys wealth, and the loser is buried in the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran walks over, kneels beside him, pulls out from his pocket The silver cigarette holder, ignited, forced a few mouthfuls to make the cigarette light brighter, and he put the cigarette on the lips of Kregan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fake, if you dig out your heart, I guess I can see it squirming." Kregan raised his hand and gripped it. The smoke, the cigarette butt quickly turned red. He coughed and smog. "When I met from the west, I knew you would look down on us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just look down on myself." Fran answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As you say, the right to speak is in the mouth of the winner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran I opened his clothes and checked the injury. "You can live for up to an hour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What a cruel words, yes, you have a wonderful cure. Ability, do you want me to beg for mercy, pleading and satisfying your mood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I won't do this." Fran is blunt Say, "You know that I have many things, and now I am from a hostile position, and I am not a compassionate saint."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan smoked silently, which seemed to exhaust his last vitality. He struggled to control the gradually stiff fingers and throw away the burning cigarette butt. "Give me a good time, I don't want to suffer in this kind of pain." The lieutenant lasted an hour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was full of regrets smelling in the air, mixed with bloody tobacco scent, eyes turned up, dead Dead staring at Fran, "You will have this end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, no one can escape." Fran said he took the gun Topped in Kregan's eyebrows, the trigger was pulled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames swallowed the building of the lair, and the heat turned everything into dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea under the night, the island of the sky is like a shining beacon, especially conspicuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dock, neatly placed a dozen boxes of wealth, it originally belonged to Kregan, Fran also did not intend to take away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran’s black windbreaker was stained with blood. He stood on the Black King who had already left the island. He looked back to Lauvita and said, The hidden channels that you can control slowly rise to the surface."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is estimated that tomorrow, the entire Golden Horn Bay gang will receive news, they look after a while , will rush to grab the site."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let them grab, do not conflict. Only need to occupy the top of the entire smuggling trade, the unlicensed private Goods, only our businesses can circulate; the money that is unknown, only our money laundering company can bleach. Numerous large and small gangs come together, each occupying some small sites, we only hide in low-key Behind them. In this way, no matter which channel is blocked and which gang is annihilated, it will not affect us. As long as there are gangs in the Golden Horn Bay and there are smugglers, the energy source will continue to provide nourishment."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understood."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, go to Feidu, pretend props and identity documents, all ready."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Um."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Missy wants to revisit the place, then, as a native, he would not give a small gift, It is too unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
