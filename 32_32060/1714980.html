			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The night is getting thicker, the moon seems to be clouded, and it is looming in the far night sky, and even the radiance of milky white becomes unpredictable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyder is sleeping in the midsummer night lazy time, looking far away, the whole city is like a huge, lazy animal, the wall is it The body, the city gate is a closed mouth, the subtle lights of the tall buildings in the city are half covered with confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Fryer saw the wanted order of his own people at the entrance to the city gate. This is the fifth day of his flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, five hundred Caesars, it’s just a small one." The giant punch Kregan seems to have some complaints, and even more so that he is unbalanced, Fran’s reward The amount is two thousand caesar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fraud, royal family, murder..." Kregan licked his lips. "Hey, man, your case is worse than me, maybe with you." Escape is a wrong choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't mind if I separate." Fran replied tiredly, the transformation has been maintained for too long, plus the small policeman Healing the Holy Power consumed, he suspects he can hold on for a few more days? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s all on the road. If you drop your companion, you can ruin the reputation that I made with my fist.” Kregan waved his hand, he didn’t want to give up. This rare mysterious helper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five days ago, he witnessed that this person, from the hands of death, rescued the police who were fatally injured, the knife on the neck, with the naked eye The speed of seeing healed into a reddish scar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;龙脉者! Although it is the head of a small gang in a small place, the giant boxing has heard of such incredible human beings, and the ability is more practical. He has not heard of the characters in the Dragon's veins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the underground world, this means that he can fight unscrupulously, as long as he does not die on the spot, it is equal to having unlimited life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the way to evacuate, who can expect what happened? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Kreigan immediately put down his body and invited Fran to flee together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come into the city?" Fran asked without expression. "The guards will recognize us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, even if my mother came, I couldn't recognize the wanted person on the wanted order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan laughed with the two hands, and the clumsy image on the notice was simply a graffiti after the third-rate painter drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s because the painting is too bad." Fran said, "Psychological warfare commonly used by the police, let the wanted people relax and be alert, but actually. They The wanted order sent to each city, and Zhang only circulated inside, the Master will take this trick, extract the physical characteristics of the criminal directly from the eyewitness memory, and then form an image on the paper, at least eight images."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan admired admirably, "Fortunately, there is you. Then you can enter the city in another way, the way, the natural way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran followed the head of the gang and walked to the left along the wall. He does not believe that Kregan will not know the wrists of the police. This seems to be only a big man who speaks by fist. The heart is amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still remembers that when Kregan was in the prison car, he said to the prisoner of the same car. "I am going to the north to avoid the limelight." In fact, from the beginning of the flight, they set off toward the Golden Bay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the gang knows that the little punks in the same car are not hiding, and sooner or later they will be caught, and the confession they provide will interfere with the police’s judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and he are wary, hiding strength, and relying on each other to cope with the pursuit of the authorities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hed City is an important transit point for the Golden Bay and the Mainland. Numerous large shops have established a semicolon here. A large number of expensive goods shipped by Feidu are collected here and sent to all parts of the country. The food and wool that are lacking in the large and small towns of the Gulf are also transported by Haide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the fees are all wholesale markets for the original products, then Hyde is a trademarked, well-packed wholesale market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the price of Haide is amazing. In the city that never sleeps, it is worth 10,000 tea bricks, wrapped in gold foil here. After loading into a small jar, it can sell for twenty-five thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night became thicker, and at first the faintly seen lights were extinguished, and the black charms that moved quickly along the corners became more and more sneaky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large discharge in the section of the Western Wall. The thick iron fence, like the sentinel, refuses to enter and exit the human race, but the sentinel apparently has been passive. The three fences from right to left have been loosened and simply placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Biss, one of the big men’s men, bent over and carefully pulled the fence out of the stone, leaving a gap that was just one person wide. When everyone came in, he reverted and applied mud to the junction of the iron bars and the stone walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sewage pipe is not long, and soon came to the end, Kregan prevented Fran from climbing out of the sewer leading to the street. "There is a square above, there may be Patrolman," he said, and then carefully scraped the end of the knives with a knife. (11) He saw the mark on a stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smuggling traffickers to the old road, to go to the city to advance the city is to pay goods tax, but as far as the people from the tax bureau, the merchants without shops are not allowed After selling the goods, and the tax payment was paid by the store, the road was abandoned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan touched the raised iron ring on the stone. Touching the prepared rope, several people joined forces to pull the half-meter-long stone out of the stone, which was a curved tunnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a mine tunnel, the tunnel air is turbid, and the rows of wooden frames supporting the walls are rotted. "Now, I wish the opposite person good luck." The roots giggled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" Fran asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The opposite of a house leading to the old district, the most street, the smuggling head bought the entire alley to keep secrets, but a few years ago, After the smugglers gave up the stronghold in the city, God knows what the house is doing now. Maybe it’s deserted and uninhabited, or it may be sold to someone’s house.” Kregan said, “Everything waits until the opposite, you know "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran asked, "If you live, what are you going to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "We have a knife, and the other party will not be prepared." Kregan replied, but after remembering the pity of this new accomplice, he was busy adding, "Probably don't hurt people, tie them up and control until we leave ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably crawling for a few hundred meters, without an exit, Kregan patted the wall and listened carefully to the echo. "It was blocked, but not thick."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Return?" asked Little Biss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, we can't get into the city, it's not a good idea to wander in the wilderness." Kregan frowned and took a deep breath of air. Put an iron ring on your finger and then slam into the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three times, only three times, the soil is attached to the other side of the cement, was crushed, and the dust dissipated. After Krygan jumped out, he discovered I went to the storage room in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Outside the storage room, someone squats again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guys, get ready." Kregan slammed the door open, outside the door, standing in front of four people yawning and staring at the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not waste the power of the ash, the giant boxing will let them honestly no longer squat, and his two men, dragged out from the bed in the second floor bedroom Old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are the gangsters, do you know who you offended?" the old man yelled, not at all as a prisoner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan and Fran also found that this home is a special, not a normal old, except for the old man, the other are strong young men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doubts soon got the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Bies looked at a book taken out of the old man’s bedroom. He looked more and more trembling, looked up, and whispered to Kregan with fear. Said, "Head, the Hummer is a honeycomb, and it seems to be the largest squad of the Golden Bay: an intelligence stronghold of Igo Andech."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kregan’s face was ugly, but when he saw it, the old man’s expression of arrogance squeezed out of his teeth. “It’s already offended anyway. I’ll review this old thing and see if I haven’t returned to the nest. People, one piece to clean up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rest, clothes, supplies, news, etc. Get the information about the search and arrest immediately. Even if Igo Andech is more powerful, it will take ten days to estimate what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time they had disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Man, you see, don't solve these few people, we will have trouble." Krigan stressed to Fran, "It is a big trouble." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is still indifferent, but the emotions that appear in his eyes for a moment make Creigan feel scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hate, joy, anger, doubt, Kregan is sure that he has an illusion, a human being, there can be no such contradictory and intense eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be free, before that, let them say the news of Igo Andech," said Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Igo Andech’s source of information is more informed than Kregen’s imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also benefits from several Dragons who can deliver messages over long distances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underworld is now on an island in the Golden Bay, and this is one of his places to stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The information base of Haide City seems to have gone wrong, and the secret number was not transmitted in two days." Igo said that the small position was not important and was not arranged. What is the manpower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not mean that any gang or police station can trample on it at will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he doesn't handle it, he will have no face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since that trial, the ass incident has spread in the underground world, he has become sensitive, for fear of falling into the ridiculous words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joe, you go to Hyde City to deal with it, it’s a mix, it’s solved. If it’s a policeman, you have to give it a bit of color.” Igo commanded "The manpower near Haide is temporarily commanded by you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe Corleone nodded, and his obedience made Igo very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
