			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The wholesaler of Golden Horn Bay is sweating. "This is impossible. I used my warehouse to steal military goods. It was all over when I was found by the authorities." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He regrets why he is stupid enough to arrange several security guards outside the warehouse outside the city. As a result, when he visited the inventory of the warehouse, he was invited by the three gangsters to the carriage. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are some things to ask for help, don't be afraid." They swear by the good intentions. Then Tosso saw a local smuggling head, Kreigan, in a room in the town of Sara. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our goods are always sold better and faster," said the giant boxing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this about me? Tosso thought in his heart and did not dare to speak out. He is a profitable person. He buys Craiggen's smuggled goods at a low price, and then obtains a sales license by bribery, and sells it as a high-priced tax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it does not mean that he dared to touch the authorities to find the most severe arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Silence is tantamount to rejection." Kregan stood up and took out the stick wrapped in iron. "Which?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which?" Tosso repeated this, he did not know what it meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Left or right hand." Kregan looked at the hog to be slaughtered. "You have to leave one."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Day, I can help you sell a lot of things in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Similarly, you have earned a lot." Kregan put down the stick. "Choose to be friends, or be a disability, think about it." Then Lauvita Whiteman walked with a stack of paperwork. Come over, Tosso had seen this beautiful girl when he was working with the gang. He looked at her like a help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl frowned her eyebrows, "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let an old friend Know our friendship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not the western countryside. The rude means are not suitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan laughed, "Miss Whiteman, are you teaching me how to do things?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the agent of the head in the Gulf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The right to you I have a lot of thoughts, but as a woman, the only value is to wash the bed and wait for the man." Kregan used iron bars across his trousers and touched the genitals of the lower tosso. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the wholesaler tremble with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it's something else, Lauvita can't care, but this wholesaler is very helpful in giving her a task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautita sneered and said, "Oh, you think so." She took out her pistol and opened the wheel to pour the bullet inside. . Only one was left, and then in the face of Kregan, the magazine was quickly dialed a few times, and then the guns were combined. "Well, maybe this can be solved with the stupidity of your man." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roulette?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dare to play, if I win, put Tosso."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't I be afraid of a woman who is as big as a hen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Luo Weita lowered his head, his eyes scattered a bit of green, "... within three seconds. The chance of hitting the bullet was reduced to 1.32%." She has done many experiments in private. To analyze the value of your mysterious ability. However, this ability can be used up to five times a day, and it is possible to raise or lower the possibility of encountering an accident in a person who has touched the left hand or a small object that is very light in weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but very limited. She can make the pot boiling water on the stove rupture because it can't withstand the high temperature. At the moment of the licensing, there is an 80% chance of getting the trump card, but it is impossible to create an accident out of thin air, such as making a healthy enemy. Because of the absence of a heart attack, it is dead and upturned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the time of control is limited to three seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It works well in certain environments, but in most cases, this ability is just a display. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the muzzle on his head, Lauvita quickly pulled the trigger twice. Then throw the gun to Kregan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn, this girl really dares to play! The big fist is thinking, but his men are watching himself. He can't escape the challenge of a woman. Kregan took the gun, and the skin smiled and bite his teeth, and pulled the trigger. After the air rang, he was safe and sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I advise you to forget, in case you die in this boring gambling. I am not good enough to explain to the leader of the Van Gle."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another answer to his voice is a loud air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan felt that sweat was flowing down his armpit, and his hands were twisted together. Keep playing, there is a 50% chance that he will be like a broken tomato. Finally, he muttered wickedly, "Mad, you won!" and then slammed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can go." The girl looked at the wholesaler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torso thanked him gratefully, but the words below Lauetta made him look pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember that you have a 200,000 bond issued by the Double Eagle Fee branch, um, all sold out in a week."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the Double Eagle bond has risen very well, and it is very uneconomical to sell now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or I will take you Then hand it over to Kregan?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“...well, madam.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send Taking the ropes, Lauvita sat down on the sofa exhaustedly, and continuously used the ability to control the fate to make the girl physically exhausted. She lay half-lying, silently calculating all the double-eagle debts in her hands, and the number of people who had the money they were convinced by various methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simultaneous sale of millions of bonds, coupled with the rumors of the collapse of the collapse, will lead to a shortage of cash chains in the Double Eagle branch, if this will lead to a storm It is sure to spread to the head office of the capital. Then, the head plan can be smoother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work 16k novel network exclusive text version of the first release, without permission can not be reproduced, excerpts, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grand banquet featuring Peggy and Julius is held in the magnificent Red Pavilion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the respect of the royal family, all the carriages are parked on the square 100 meters away from the main entrance of the Red Pavilion. The dense wheels will be inlaid with colorful mosaics on the ground. The paintings were also concealed, so that some guests with low official positions and titles were inconvenient to grab a parking space with the Grand Dukes and had to park the car farther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance from the carriage to the gate of the palace, the shorter, the more able to reflect the honor of human identity, this is invisible, but also a kind of show-off . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silver Avenue leading to the palace, the bustling road, the road that can accommodate six horses, the carriages with various badges and the palace guards along the way Occupy, the people in the car, while secretly complaining that the road is more spacious, just look at the envy of many people who did not take the carriage, but the guests who came to ride, walk freely between the gaps of the vehicle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is wearing a black-purple-lined formal dress with a lilac-like crow on his cuffs. This crow pattern is also the emblem of the Lord Ingmar Knights who have no heirs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the earliest bought, fell to the troupe of the old Marlow Southwest, from the Heihe Hotel to the Dafna Palace built in the city of Tantin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Nantes also knows him, animals are always more loyal than humans. This Klezdale Hummer took a small step and was full of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sir David Knight." Viscount Kate rode on the moon and came over from behind. "You don't want to spend half an hour to park?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I guess it will be very lively, I didn't expect people to be so much." Fran said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, as long as it is a celebrity of Tantin, there is no way to try to get the stickers, officials of the etiquette department. In recent days, but the most hottest A group of people." Kate smiled and whispered, "Your horse is not suitable for identity, if you ride the wind, it will be more appropriate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"This horse has been with me for a long time, and the relationship is more important than the value."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you are a compassionate person."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They talked and sent the mount to the stables, then walked up the marble steps with brocade carpets, after showing the stickers and passing the necessary security checks. Walked into the arch tunnel leading to the hall of the Red Hall. There are many silver headlights hanging from the gold chain above the tunnel, which is emitting soft and just light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glitz of glamorous and colorful clothes and gold and silver jewels is the theme of the Red Pavilion at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of Tantin. The diplomatic ambassadors of various countries, the well-known rich man, the face that seems ordinary people must look up, is pretending to be either a gentle or rigorous and trustworthy expression, and spits a false compliment in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people in the crowd who do not have obvious signs, and they are wary of people. They should be secret secret police who secretly protect the venue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you iron the door with iron bars and put the fire on it, the whole Byron will collapse tomorrow." Fran thought a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don Enrique Finance Minister has come, he is the chairman of the Pegasus Club." Kate looked at the far corner. Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you introduce me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." Kate replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the world, nothing is absolute. If a farmer who loves alcoholism will be regarded as a beggar who is destined to be a poor man for a lifetime, but for the artist, the act of indulging in the wine country all day, is the elegance, shortcomings and advantages of seeking inspiration in the drunken town, forever because of identity , the background does not need to convert each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is in the eyes of the president of the Pegasus Club, which should be sent to the monastery bell tower. The appearance that you don’t let out in your life, because of the millions of nets in your pockets, the titles of foreign nobles, and the adventures of the priests of Kate’s paintings, especially the ones that have met the Eastern Emperor, become different. The finance minister has a strong interest in the strange-looking gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the East, the financial officer is called Shangshu and has the title of Zhengzhi Shangqing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I heard that you are in Shangri-La, called Zheng Zhiqing, I don’t know what is different from Shangqing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As the name suggests, it is equivalent to the Duke’s.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Commend that system, finance, but the blood of a country's prosperity, taken by the Duke for granted." Tang Enke Lifu said loudly, this ingenious compliment made him very useful. Tang En was only a small baron at first. Because of the grace of the emperor, he got the status of the count, but it is not worth mentioning for the Duke’s family who passed down for centuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in the payment of private letters, Clifford often writes only the position of his own minister, not his own title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if the Emperor's Majesty will come to visit." Fran asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As everyone knows, your body has not always been good, I have news that today will not come." Kelly replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately." Fran said, and then turned the topic to the field of the Earl’s profession. "I heard that the Finance Department has a major project, and you know that I am Investing in money, the money in the pocket, will only be moldy and stinking, only the circulation can reproduce its own value."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your information is well-informed, However, the investment in this project has been jointly undertaken by the official and the Double Eagle Bank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a shame." Fran shrugged and continued to talk about some in the capital. The most fashionable topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boring communication, but must adapt." He thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The boring banquet, like a monkey kidnapped to the stage, was arbitrarily discussed by others." Peggy said she was wearing a white trim. Low-cut dress skirt, white chest hanging with a faint red diamond necklace, wearing a craftful crown like a head tube, looks very luxurious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today is a good day for us to make a joint appearance with the public for the first time." Crown Prince Julius said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is a bad day. Peggy thought, she sent Jules, who was stuck to her side, to leave the single dressing room. After confirming no one, she said to the window, "How is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of the gap between the stone and the decoration gradually shows the outline. It is a short man. "Master, the emperor is guarded by the strict. Many places, we can't go"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it impossible for the King of Shadows to talk about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are two masters in the court, and we also found A secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Secret?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the identity of the Shadow King organization, There are also mysterious attendants in the court. If they are not expected, they should also be dragons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a good reminder." Peggy thought , ask, "If you are fighting ahead, what is your chance of winning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the hierarchy of the organization, the most powerful in the palace is only At the Guild level, those who wear the Red Knight Medal are not opponents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the Crown Prince came from outside the door," Miss Peggy, the banquet began. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She told, "Now don't stun the snake. The most hidden piece, you have to play at the most critical moment." Then walked toward the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the marriage contract with the royal family, Peggy feels a conspiracy, the emperor has been physically weak, and he is not allowed to deal with government affairs in a few years. To Julius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, His Majesty took the risk to make the woman of the gorse a queen in the future. Although in the eyes of the public, this is a symbol of the emperor and aristocratic forces, but it is really so simple? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to be a victim and hostage in the cracks between the family and the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To build your own power, talent, I need more people." Peggy thought in his heart, and then tried to hang a smile on his face. Go to the damn banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
