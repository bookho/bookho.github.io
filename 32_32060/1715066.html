			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Fullan placed the glass on the stone railing of the balcony, and the two arms stretched forward, stretching the joints of the bones and muscles like a small firecracker. The sound of friction. At nine o'clock in the evening, the sky was already dark, and the soft snow flakes were rolled up by the cold wind of the hustle and bustle, flying over the sky. The moon was hung in the air, the light was pale, and the night was shining. The sparse pedestrians on the road rushed to the warm home. Staying in the cold street is not a good idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a quaint and secluded two-storey villa located on the border of the city of Tantin and the suburbs. The snow is full of flower beds with evergreen shrubs on both sides of the villa door. A smooth, private street light is emitting orange light, making the snow falling into the light range like a haze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villa is holding a meeting of senior officials of the Justice Department. The table is filled with cheese and fresh fruit, and the fireplace is full of charcoal. Fran is able to participate, out of his honorary position, the private consultant of His Royal Highness, and the private adviser of the ordinary judge, the value is very different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Knights of the Knights, wine and snow, are elegant enjoyment." Another person came to the balcony, his body was thin, wearing gold glasses, I like to talk and take the tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ross Prosecutor." Fran nodded to him. This person is the confidant of the Missy in the Justice Department. In fact, the Justice Department has two Send people, each person adds an extra name outside the position. Upholding neutrality, it is estimated that only cleaners and handymen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The results of the decree have almost come out. For the sake of balance, the two candidates on the two sides are each half." Rose is obviously not looking for a blessing. Lan chat snow scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the major national celebrations, it was an ancient tradition to issue defamation orders to let the lucky ones in the prison leave the cold cage and reintegrate into society. The order was issued jointly by the Emperor and the House of Representatives, but the specific candidate was decided by the Justice Department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A family wants to save his child who is not competing; the big man intends to pull his mistress’s distant relatives out of the prison; the rich have spent a lot of money For the pen, I just want to add a name to the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average prisoner who meets the terms is less than 40%. The remaining places often become gifts for the judges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a problem now. There is Sir Viba on the list. The second officer of the Finance Department was sentenced to 20 years in prison for four years ago. The man has mastered some gorse, although the Reinschmann family I don’t want to put this former middle-level bureaucrat in my eyes, but I don’t want him to bring unnecessary troubles.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The jazz knows how to protect themselves. Closed mouth, this is why he can enjoy his old age in prison. But no one can tell, if he comes out, he will be induced to say something that should not appear in the social field. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list will be reviewed and announced at the official meeting of the Judicial Office three days later, but the candidate has been finalized tonight.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran thought for a moment, "Does the secret he knows is heavy? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is already a past tense, it doesn't matter. But how much will bring embarrassment to the face of the gorse. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" More importantly, the political tendency, the enemy of the gorse." It was released by the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not addressed, it will be considered weak. "Fran said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is correct. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What the director thinks. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The attitude is very determined. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, the director is not out of personal friendship with the jazz?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Purely want to create a little trouble for the gorse. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, then agree. Not only agree, but also very happy. "Fran's eyes are black and black, and there is almost no barley.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ross Prosecutor stunned and looked at Fran very strangely.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are not aware of the importance of Fran in the Justice Department’s Peggy faction, thinking that he is only a speculator among the forces. But Ross knows that this The Knight Advisor and the Earl of Honor, is deeply trusted by His Royal Highness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is good at layout, proficient in law, and always reverses the situation from an unexpected angle. In the time when Peggy was unable to personally direct the judicial department's space period because of the wedding ceremony and the honeymoon, the Knights of the Knights had become a half-management commander, and arranged the important affairs in private. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sir Vibe should have a family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has a son, two Daughter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life is embarrassing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the crime of corruption, almost all Property was confiscated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, just find a top-ranking company affiliated with the gorse, arrange for them to have a high salary, and let the hall Long know before the announcement of the list. Time is best chosen on the day of the meeting. So he did not have time to analyze it carefully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose understood the intention, he walked back to the hall, Laughing and saying to everyone, "I don't have any objections."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief of the Justice Department’s Colonel Crowe thought suspiciously, "There is no fierce rebuttal, this is not Like the style of the golden bird."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow outside the balcony is even more angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As if to re-present the past life again." Fran thought, he played such a role in the first court of Feidu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once hated the land and was helpless, but now he accepted it for the purpose of revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is really a burlesque. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, there was no name for Sir Viba on the special list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cello Hall headed his forehead, "Fortunately, I found it in time, and the eldest son of Viba is preparing to go to Tianjian Ocean Office as a deputy manager. Everyone knows." The firm is a family business of gorse, and Viba must have reached an agreement with them to use security for security. If he is released, it will lie with the heart of Reinschmann."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like His Royal Highness, Long live Byron!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal news is always the hottest topic of the public, and Peggy’s honeymoon trip is every, praying Cinderella, who can be a prince, is also difficult to describe in the most daring nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They spent a month in the southern part of the most comfortable and warm winter, living in the fairyland-like Rose Palace in the valley, with warm water irrigation and insulation The flower gardens make the palace Changchun unfortunately all year round, colorful. The Hunting Court is nearby, and Julius is happy to discover that he is finally better than his wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a gunshot, I woke up a hibernating bear. Of course, when it was awkwardly drilled out of the snow cave, the guards began to volley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The most deadly shot was opened by me." His Royal Highness said glaringly at the bullet hole of the brown bear's forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, it seems that I am practicing the guns." Peggy shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, they went to the casino, Pena, to seek out those exciting games, the mayor’s ceremonial guards set the way for them, and all the heads of the gaming industry dreamed of the royal family. When I came to my own casino, Peggy only chose the largest one, and she was a big one. Missy especially loved playing cards. She enjoyed the feeling of calculating at the poker table. Next is the bullfighting. Whenever the cow squirts blood and falls down, or the bullfighter is turned over and trampled, it always makes her excited and flushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really want to try it myself," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrified Julius wiped his sweat and thanked his wife for just laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final stage of the winter is a shuttle between cities, which is a journey that makes the royal family and the public more intimate. Everywhere, the atmosphere is boiling like the oil that is boiling on the flames. The prince of the Junjun couple sits in the open carriage and slowly passes through the square. Every time Peggy waved, the crowd cheered, colored confetti, accompanied by The most solemn salute was overwhelming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sleep in the most luxurious restaurants, with skilled chefs to create delicious dishes, black caviar, chop meat pie, golden chestnut wine And Peggy has always been keen on stewing sheep eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
