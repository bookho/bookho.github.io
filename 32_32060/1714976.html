			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The wheel is flying, the window is a leisurely country landscape painting, the extended type of compartment can sit twelve, people, the door is not in the middle of the ordinary style Instead, two doors were designed, one near the driver's seat and the other at the end of the car for easy access. The plush wood benches are lined up against the inner wall, with a wide aisle in the middle, a red carpet on the bottom, but dirty, black and black footprints everywhere. Everyone is shrinking their feet, because if they don't pay attention, they will kick in another passenger sitting opposite you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This car seems to be more comfortable, only eight passengers, very spacious, Fran put the suitcase across the space on the side of the body, with the corner of the eye Light hits other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on his left is a small staff member of a bank or futures bank. The shirt collar is worn by the futures staff, and the small bow tie is bright. The box, which was holding the black-skinned notepad, looked at it, but the dim light and the shaking of the car made him give up quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite of Fran is an old man with a little outer character, wearing breeches, and a lot of patches on the crotch. You should always ride horses. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two miners in the Western Gold Mine who can be inferred from the dirty dust and strong shoulders in their skin gaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other three people in the carriage are like ordinary small traders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sao Paulo public carriage is divided into four trains a day, starting at 4:1 in the afternoon, arriving at the first transfer station after three hours, the car is going to change horses. Passengers who want to go to the next place have to make up the ticket. Fran is ready to raise his eyes. He is safe now, but only for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Paris has a sigh of relief, the person who pretends to be the prosecutor is associated with the big man of the troupe, which will cause trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the swaying bumps, it was dark, and the little staff seemed to feel stuffy. Stand up, walk to the opposite side and pull the curtains up, bursting with the breeze of the fields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the car, the magic crystal light hanging from the top is also lit, the light is very dark, but it can keep the guests from getting into the dark environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s about seven o'clock to get to the station, lift the body and wipe off the make-up. Then no one can find me again.” Fran's eyebrows were scratched with nails, and he accidentally saw the passenger at the rear of the car. To the forefront, the person who stayed at the front door of the scorpion made a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not good!" Fran thought, the two men clearly knew, but did not sit together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the car has slowly dropped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gentlemen, I want to get off the bus and get off the bus. I only stop once in the middle." The driver said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage is parked on the side of the road. Not far away is a small shrub. I want to have a miner and an old man opposite, and Fran follows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And three people he considers to be small traders. It is also coming down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked into the bushes, one of them chased in, stood not far away, and untied the belt if nothing had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miners are also humming a little song, and soon the haystack underneath his voice slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, friend, is there a fire?" Fran took out the cigar from the pocket and went to ask him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spy was clearly stunned and took out the lighter from his pocket. Light for Tefran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you going?" The spy asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, businessman, ready to buy some goods." Fran took a cigarette and spit out the smog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One person? This world can't be too flat." The spy smiled and thought to himself. "You can pretend, wait until no one is there, some are ways to let You speak the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spies are very cautious, they are, after all, private intelligence personnel who can’t see the light. It is necessary to avoid public occasions and to be careful whether the other party has an associate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unscrupulous spy can't live long distances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran also thought, "It is not an official secret police. Otherwise, as long as you get an arrest warrant, you can catch yourself without getting on the bus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dal A private spy of Mark or Gorse? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that his disguised identity has been violent in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are also a businessman?" Fran looked at the spy, the plain coat, and the edges were also burrs. "It’s not very well mixed."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Selling is difficult to do." The spy shrugged his shoulders. "Well, you have a good dress and made a lot of money?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Hah, this cigarette is worth a Caesar. "Fran answered with the tone of the nouveau riche. "I am buying and selling, like you can't do it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You made me interested. What is the sale? "The spy is flattering and wants to take advantage of the opportunity to get more information." You see the big man with a pocket in his pocket. This cigar is the authentic goods of the whole tobacco leaf. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still know the goods. Franhaha smiled and walked out of the bush, noting that the other two spies were guarding outside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver said, "Gentlemen, can be fast." Some? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, I didn't smoke." "Fran is screaming in nowhere. "You can't wait to get a tip." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden words, like to show off the nouveau riche, this is the conclusion of the spy, this kind of person is best to deal with, as long as a little compliment, they The secret will be like a bamboo tube.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intelligence worker can be different from the secret police with an official background. It is best not to use violence without violence. Moreover, the heads of the three of them have not come yet, and have not yet passed the new instructions to the superiors. "Stare at him, don't let him slip, and seize him if necessary." "This is their task.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you talk about it? "The spy asks, "If I can make a fortune, I will thank you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't learn, like my identity, you can have a big man care..." Fran's words suddenly stopped, his face showed The look of the mouth, "Nothing, it's time to get on the bus. He threw down half of the smoke.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver is still complaining, "I will be deducted when I get to the station."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think this can block your mouth." Lan took out his wallet and took out a ticket. He counted it slowly, and the driver showed his greedy expression and consciously stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawing a banknote, Fran handed the driver to the ground and accidentally dropped the wallet when he put it back in his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen tickets have floated to the ground, "Damn!" Fran squatted and picked, and the spy also asked for help, waiting for him. When I picked up one of them, I was stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a 50-piece vouchers, there is a gorse logo with ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come this guy?" The spy thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the gorse sign, there is a special symbol, which is given by a son of the Grand Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forged? Or, is this person assigned by a young master of the Reinschmann family? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must be more careful, family struggle is inevitable, a small spy in the district, don't get involved in it, or even the bones will not be left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan took the banknote and looked at the spy with suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, this ticket is a bit dirty." The spy replied quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, the family accidentally soiled." Fran said this, but the action was very careful to smooth the banknotes and put them in the wallet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the people got on the bus, they continued to move a distance, one of the three spies, shouted, "I am here, stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you arrive at the station, you will be away from my destination. Take a distance," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran's little tricks worked, and the spies communicated in some way and were ready to report up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
