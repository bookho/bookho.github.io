			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. "A very beautiful little thing." Ann bent his fingers casually, the action of the tit flying, immediately solidified, it was like an invisible rope She was tied up and dragged back to the window. The girl grabbed it in her hand and teased the bird with her finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call a few to listen." Ann smiled and said that the tits struggled in her palm, and the brown-red feathers with brown spots scattered. The hard bird squatted on the girl's finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really disobedient." The girl groaned boringly, spread her hand and released it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relieved tits, fluttering their wings in fear, flew away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet flying far away, a bullet wrapped in a green mantle, silently passing by, the poor bird, did not have time to send out The sorrows, the body burst into numerous pieces of flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The scenery of the brakes." An frowned, turned his eyes to an open space downstairs, she shouted, "Who? You hurt?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drow in the scorpion of Zolfa Longqi, he was thrilled with excitement, this new magical power, as if to let him see a new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are the mind, no matter how you shoot, the bullets can perfectly hit the target in sight. Even the best gunmen can't reach this level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has experimented countless times until the guns are hot, and the results achieved are all told to him that this is not a dream, but a real reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;龙脉者? Zall Law has just understood this term and has successfully become one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom, this is the gift of fate to me, the murderer, this time see how you run." He shouted in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's still a good long-range blocking ability." Someone said. Zolfa looked back and saw the beautiful god of death who saved him. I don’t know when, standing behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Corleone, bother you," Zall said reverently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without aiming, you can automatically attack the target, you can be a good killer." Ann commented. "But the energy composition is very strange. I actually feel that there is no energy in your body. Maybe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zolf is fascinated by the security The bright lips, I feel that my heart is fluttering, my chest is hot, a kind of special, strange feelings, make this old man feel embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen many beautiful women above the standard. For example, Ma Dida, Zall Law has only cared for her elders, and Peggy, he appreciates the kind of temperament, oppressive temperament, but in front of this little girl who is his age, Zall Law actually I realized the emotion I never felt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He vaguely remembers the warmth and feeling that he felt when he died. Mother's breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is nearly fifty years old. The stubborn and paranoid old man, loved for the first time in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling came so fast that he didn’t even know how to face it. He was like a clear-haired boy, and he was at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What are you doing?" Ann said for a long time, but saw Zolfa's strange look, alternating on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss, what are you talking about?" Zall Law tried to expel the girl's Yan Rong from the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, you come, let's do a small test." An Chao waved his hand, since it was boring, he helped the new Dragon's rookie. Completely evaluate the ability to pass the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the villa group, there is a weapons warehouse, although the dragons are more dependent on the talent battle, but the shadow king believes that if you can be familiar with various weapons, There is nothing wrong with Gabriel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, most of the Dragons, before waking up, are ordinary people without fighting skills. A warrior who lives in a dragon's pulse will definitely be more horrible than someone who only knows how to use talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came to the warehouse, he took out a pistol full of bullets in the room where the firearms were placed. She handed it to Zall Law and pointed to a bush of shrubs two hundred meters away from the window. "You try, can No hit. "Zall law, according to instructions, raised the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first shot is far-reaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second shot, even directly into the soil, stirred up a piece of dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cheered and cautiously opened a third shot, and the bullets slammed through the four meters from the bush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try again with your original gun." An unexpected expression, she nodded "as it was" and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three consecutive shots, the bullets are drawn perfectly in the orbit, like a bomb, the bushes are blown up and broken, leaving only a circle of dark mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drow law looks at Ann doubtfully, he does not know why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that it is not you who really mutate, but your gun. It is too rare, no, not rare, it is absolutely unique!" It’s sunny, “Please take care of your gun. It’s the source of your abilities, or it’s already an extra part of your body.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss is training new people again." 裴吉雷克斯 stood in front of the window on the third floor, looking at what happened in the distance, he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an extremely luxurious room with crystal chandeliers, couches, furniture and chairs wrapped in gold foil, and Joel Corleone, the leader of the King of Shadows Sitting behind a mahogany table, he wore comfortable dark blue silk pajamas and was concentrating on cutting four mature bloody beef with a knife and fork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take her to toss, she just can't sleep." Joe said, "The distinguished lady, through our branch in Tanding, What new instructions are passed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet, she still keeps us on the move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "So, another blood dragon in Byron's Dragon Blood Organization, can there be new trends?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
