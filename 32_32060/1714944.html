			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who grew up in Linhai City are generally half sailors and swimming experts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is very happy not to forget the rhythm of swimming, the sky is already half dark, the strong wind blows the blue and black night sky on the tulle, the fog is blurred Stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sea, the brightly lit fees are like a jewel containing a flame, and it is tempting to seduce Fran. It took him a long time to hold back, and he went back to the city and returned to the idea of ​​breaking the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this horrible look, even the city gates don't want to go in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where should I go?" Fran thought, he was eager to escape when he was in the waterway, and now he is free, but finds homeless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to find a way to integrate into society, otherwise, like a mouse hiding in the sewer, don't talk about revenge, even survival will become a problem." Fran and desperate, he sneaked into the sea with a fierce, calming his mind with cold water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking, please think, people can solve problems with thinking, don't rely on instinct like beasts." Fran thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the sky was completely black, William, the name jumped out of memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the supernatural power has changed the body, then those who seek to master the power of supernatural may be able to find ways to restore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the port is well recognizable, and the pier of the night shift is faintly bright, and under the night, the direction is pointed like a lighthouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the pier first, then swim to the left, Jiuhai, the Master lives on the small island there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hopes that Fran will be full of energy, he slaps the waves, carefully avoids the boats of the night flight, and when he passes the dock, he sees a lot of cargo piled up. At the port, the workers who unloaded the goods talked a lot:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There must be some disasters to happen, and more than a dozen roads leading to the city are in the ground." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The road has been blocked by the holy warriors, and the church's lords are not willing to stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The West City Silk Shop trucks also fell in, one The car was ruined, and the silk boss lost the money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, you didn't see the boss's expression, live like a dozen The virgin who was insulted by the great man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vulgar description immediately triggered a ridicule, but soon the old workers said, " I hope that I don’t want to affect tomorrow’s work. Nobody will pay for it when no one is shipping.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words make everyone silent, the crowds laughing and laughing After a while, they spread out. Everyone is calculating the surplus money in their pockets. Can you overcome the expected downturn? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fran fascinated for a long time under the wooden platform where the pier extended over the sea, until then, he felt that he really returned to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scent of several pubs in the port made Fran even smoke a few noses. Now it is estimated that it is 10 o'clock in the evening, and the dock workers usually eat again. Nightingale to make up for the physical strength of high-intensity work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aroma of hot meals, such as the legendary singer who confuses the seafarers with singers, tempted Fran’s sudden appetite for hunger, he hesitated and decided to take the spot risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearest pub off the coast was targeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan saw no one on the road, flying out of the hidden place, the burly body like a huge mountain leopard, agile, no sound on the ground. It must be said that this body removes ugliness, the strength and flexibility contained in the muscles, and will make every exercise and martial arts warrior deeply envious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kitchen of the bistro is generally built in the back room, bent over, squeezed in from the narrow gap between the houses, and the dock house can not afford glass. The windows are usually square-shaped holes on the half-brick and half-wood walls. Two small doors are made of wooden strips, and the small latches are placed on the inner side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kitchen fumes let the wooden windows open, the gray smoke in the white pops out, and Fran carefully looks inside, while part-time chef and entertaining The tavern owner was heading out for a plate of fried fish. The sizzling fish and mashed potatoes were cooked on the stove, and a few plates of noodles were just poured on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that can be eaten immediately is only a few pieces of smoked sausage. Flemish said sorry, stretched his arm and grabbed the smoked sausage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taste of the intestines makes the taste buds of the tongue tremble excitedly, the squeaky and sensitive hearing notes that the boss is coming back, he hastily swallowed the remaining food, along the original The road returns to the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short while, the pub owner screamed and rushed out, carefully squatting in the alleys between the houses for a long time, and finally said indignantly, "The squat hybrid, Don't let me catch it. I don't use my hands to steal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the future, I will double your compensation." Fran silently listened to the boss. Swearing, dive into the water, and the strong lung capacity allowed him to swim all over the water before he floated to the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiuhai’s night swimming, for the vitality of the body, almost no difference after eating and eating on the tree-lined road, no use for an hour, Master The coral island is just around the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope Mr. William is at home." Fran is nervous again, in case the master is also helpless? Excited and anxious, he did not control the strength of the filming, suffered from the sea breeze and never enjoyed the maintenance of the door, broke free from the frame and nails, and flew directly into the living room on the first floor, hitting the wood with the same illness. On the stairs, this immediately led to the accumulation of dust and noisy noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, I almost dropped the fire crystal into the heater, who would dare to disturb a mage for alchemy experiments." William's violent voice passed from the third floor. Come, immediately, violently turned into curiosity, "outside creatures? No, maybe a servant of a colleague."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously the Master has the observation of the first floor of the observation The device, he was surprised by the appearance of the visitor. The small staircase quickly sent a "beep" sound, and the Master rushed down. "Are you old Bury, or Klein's servant? Damn, humanoid wisdom." Did the magic servant and the summoner make a breakthrough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. William, I haven’t seen it for a long time, I should explain it in detail..." Fran’s words did not After that, let the mage frown and put on the look of deputy vigilance. "I actually call my husband, who is your master, want to find me to borrow magic materials?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"You misunderstood..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I use the title of 'you'. Those who only know the experiment squandering and don't know the savings, only when the magic material is exhausted, will they whisper and please, telling your master, William is not a big head." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the wizards of the arcane circles do not believe in the purpose of borrowing and returning, watching William gestures to leave, Fran has to say long words, "I It’s Fran Fryer.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William’s body is stiff, and the vigilance of his face is more intense, unlike previous seditions with goodwill. This is completely a heap of anger. "Who are you? My poor friend is ruined, are you a member of the murderer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell of Arcane It started to sound, and the stitching grotesquely said, "Have you forgotten the mouse, herbal medicine, and mosquito repellent? I am indeed Fran, anything that only the two of us know, I can answer it if I ask it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master’s spell has stopped, joy and doubt The confusion alternates in his face, and the emotion is uncertain. "If you are not an enemy, stand still." The wizard's finger moved slightly, and sprinkled a fine sand-like powder, "reading the heart." He shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran felt a huge force coming into his mind, his consciousness became blank in an instant, I don’t know how long it took, he slowly woke up and found himself Lying on the second floor bed, William's bed was short and could only accommodate half of the body, causing Fran to sit up and turn the bed down on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage sat next to the oak table not far away, looking at Fran, sighing sadly, "Poor Flair, I just read it." Your memory, sad experience makes me angry, it is hard to imagine, there will be such ugly and despicable activities in the world, I used magic in the first court, interrogated dozens of prisoners, but their crimes are better than One percent applied to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you let me recover?" Fran smiled bitterly. "For revenge, I There have been countless ideas and ideas, but they are based on the appearance of ordinary people. This body can only bury all wishes in the heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Master Shen Shen, "I have done the test just now. Your body is very repulsive to the Austrian law. On the contrary, it is full of the energy of the magic. Perhaps it is your memory. The sacred object called the Eternal Cabinet transforms the body. Structure. This is a good thing, at least making ** extremely powerful, it is also a bad thing, I can't change your appearance with easy-to-use spells."<b r /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
