			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Barry hesitated for a while, nodded. She picked up her handbag and shouted. "Pow the pot into the water after eating it, go to bed early, I will come to wash it tomorrow morning..." As she said, she suddenly turned her side and seemed to hear something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Knight, are you at home?" Outside the house, someone was slamming the hoop on the fence door and shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s him again!" Barry whispered, she was obviously familiar with the voice. "This person has been in the six days in two days. You can't."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to see me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is your building line soon The head of the former hired worker, but the urgent matter can not be compared with the health of the boss. What's more, you were still in a coma."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fran finally remembered a crucial thing, and at the same time, he heard the voice of that person. Moore, the head of the Construction Bank Bay Branch Construction Team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let him come in," said Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The head entrusted us to you because of his friendship and trust, and hey, anything can be discussed with you, but I Waiting for two days outside the door, I got the chance to see you.” Moore’s words were filled with complaints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He has been physically for a few days..." Barry wanted to defend, but Fran waved to stop, "What is the emergency situation." He did not care. Dissatisfaction in the discourse, inquiring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An injured help..." Moore glanced at Barry. He didn't understand the identity of the woman, and he did not warn the gang gunman. "...helper, came back and reported that the limestone mountain range had an accident, Miss Whitemane, and the nine members she led, the whereabouts are unknown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no news yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore nodded. "According to the agreement, Miss Whitemane should have a new message six days and two days ago. But until today, there is still no audio."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Whitemane? Barry immediately raised her ears. She first heard the name and was the name of a woman. The head of the team secretly squinted at Fran and found that his face was extremely rare and showed a trace of tension and uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a woman’s sensitive psychology, Barrie actually had a faint hostility towards a woman who had just heard of her name and had never met her. "Please allow me to interrupt. Who is Whiteman, and what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is my assistant at the Golden Bay branch, you I haven't seen it. She went to the limestone mountains to inspect the local stone. It seems to be an accident.” Fran simply replied that he felt that Barry should not know more, so he said to her, “You are not going back to the troupe. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Barrie walked out of the door helplessly, she was still thinking. Whiteman? The woman who came out from where. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are on the third day of entering the limestone mountain range. We found the trail of Zolfa Longch.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, before, Gary and I had an accident because of climbing the slope. I was hit and vomited, and Gary’s leg was broken. In order not to affect the speed of advance, Whitemane Miss decided to let us stay in the cave for a while, with the remaining eight people to pursue." Weaver, one of the survivors, said, "I waited for two days with Gary, and the water and food left was eaten up. But they never came back. We had to venture down the mountain. Gary's legs were not treated on the mountain. I just got infected at the foot of the mountain and started a high fever. I had to send him to the hospital in the local town and report back alone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, you don't catch up to see what happened, actually dropped the lady, and escaped." Moore blamed angrily. He walked up and down anxiously in the house. The whole, gang, except the crow boss, he was the most convinced. Is Laowei Ta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waver lost his face. Head down, uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran looked at Waff’s bloodless face, and coughed on the towel, with bloodshot sputum, "He tried his best, if the road is true There was a great danger. No one of the nine people, including Lavetta, could come back. Then the two injured people rushed over and did not help. Instead, they were all buried there, and no one could come back to ask for support." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weaver glanced at Fran with gratitude. Although he chose to withdraw, he had certain weaknesses in it, but more importantly, he was afraid that he would not even be able to report back to the gang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, what other information do you have to report?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"gunshot, miss After about six hours of leaving, I vaguely heard a very dense gunshot that lasted about an hour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure?" Moore doubtfully ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"OK." Weaver answered affirmatively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mountain road is rugged, in terms of pure geography, it is much closer than the flat, and the mountain is very quiet, you can hear the six-hour field shootout, also "It's very possible," Fran thought. "That's where you can find the position of the enemy in the Lauetta."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still a lot of gunshots. Emitted, and the enemy is only one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore does not believe, "You didn't participate at all, it can be judged by sound."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, our guns are accessories that have been smuggled from the Portuguese, assembled themselves, and the sound of the fire is a little tremble, and I only hear one different from this. The sound is louder and dignified. It is the official ash who are equipped with guns.” Seeing Moore’s expression of doubt, Weaver explained desperately. “My shooting is very common, but my ears are very spiritual. This is why the lady will bring it. My reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If he is telling the truth, then the enemy is the drow law. "Lonchi is one person?" Fran frowned. "This is impossible. He is not brave enough to deal with nine fully armed gunmen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked carefully at Weaver The look is not like a fake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, what did Lauttata and her team lead to? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light imagination, does not play any role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must go there," said Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
