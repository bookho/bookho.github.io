			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The night color like ink is generally dyed on the afterglow picture of the dusk, the lights of the Huanhua light up, the whole city is shrouded in gold, silver and red. The nightlife of Tantin City officially kicked off in Suizhong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bluestone Avenue near the Bull Plaza is one of the most prosperous night market streets in the capital. During the daytime, the streets are wide and clean, and when there are faint stars in the sky, Like the woodland that wets after the rain, a mushroom-like simple pavilion made of canvas and iron sheets fills the sides of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style conforms to the current fashion, but the workmanship is not very refined, some looks are gratifying, the crafts that look good in craftsmanship, the thin carpet made of linen, Known as the 100% calf leather shoes, everything is available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary citizens who are ashamed of the slogan, young people who are pursuing the trend but can’t get more pocket money, compared to the boutique shops that have many zeros on the label. More eager to hang around the cheap night market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most attractive is a small food stall with a variety of aromas, fish chopped soup, meatballs, honey-fried chestnuts, raisins, cheese ham, nothing more than the end With a box of snacks, the purchases on the night winds of the street are more expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark purple carriage slowly walks around the night market, the well-trained thoroughbred horse, gracefully and quietly squatting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy will sneak out of the window slightly, staring at the crowd, listening to the noise of the buzzing, fingers stroking the bag on the window sill Soft fur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some kind of strange negative emotions commotion in Missy’s heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a sense of powerlessness, purely spiritual and not ** burnout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With only one month left, she has to become a beautifully wrapped gift, lying on the bed, accepting a little man and becoming a husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will get off the bus." She told the driver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, here is a place where civilians gather, not suitable for your identity." The royal knight and bodyguard driving the car, disgusted to disappoint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy raised her eyebrows. Swallowing back the words of sipping, she suddenly did not blame the Cavaliers for offending, pushed the door open and jumped directly from the slow-moving carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way the driver was shocked for a while, he hurriedly came down from the squat, suggesting that the plainclothes followers followed closely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a stockpile, protecting her safety is a top priority. And this member of the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwilling to stay in the guarded house, insisting on continuing the work of the Justice Department before the wedding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Peggy hates the feeling of being surrounded by more than a dozen fully armed knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they had to take off their armor and wear casual clothes, simplifying the number to five people, a few meters away, and guarding them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the night, the place where the three religions and the nine people have everything is the most troublesome and dangerous. And it is the owner’s temporary intention. The Cavaliers have no way to clear the field and check the suspicious elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big lady of the gorse family, aimlessly shuttles between the crowds, and occasionally stops at the stalls where the goods are sold. Feel free to look at the goods, the night market's cheap jewelry and clothes, naturally can not enter her eyes, and no appetite to taste less hygienic, but the taste is quite good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sounds not far away attracted the attention of Peggy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before selling the blueberry steamed cake stalls, a simple middle-aged man dressed in a few bags of Chinese copper plates, those who are probably tomorrow’s food The man crouched down and whispered his daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not saying that you don't want to buy anything, just come out and browse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He The old daughter, looking at the steamed cake steaming, swallowed and reluctantly removed her eyes. "Dad, then I don't eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Pulling the daughter's hand, the man just took a few steps and decided to go. Turned back again, pulled out the majority of the copper in his pocket and bought a whole piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy looked at this ordinary scene with ecstasy. The little girl was like a small animal, holding her father's neck, gently biting a small mouth, and handing the steamed cake to his mouth. "You also eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"乖 Daughter, Dad is not hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She follows her father and daughter until they Disappeared in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of simple family, have you ever experienced it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that in the distant childhood, she once worshipped her father and felt that he was the greatest god between heaven and earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This child has a sense of instinct for his father, and he has passed away when his childhood is not over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the elite education of the gorse, the affection is weak and naive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you need is to owe allegiance to the whole family, and to dedicate everything to it under its command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining the button between family members is a common interest. After all, this thing is emotional, cheap and easy to betray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Peggy still remembers one thing, that was when she was nine years old, her mother died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is a pale personality, not a lot of minds, only women who are interested in the communication between women, buying costume jewelry, born in another prominent Duke family Marrying to a father is also simply a political marriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her memory, her face is blurred, and every time she recalls, it is a more luxurious dress with different colors and bright jewels on her neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Peggy is still very sad, kneeling on the bed, crying and tired to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle, she felt that someone sat down on the bed and gently rubbed her hair with her hand. The heat from the palm of her hand made her feel at ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That should be the father’s hand, the girl was confused and gradually stopped sobbing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Autumn is a season of damp and watery, low mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm always comes when it’s not the time, the raindrops in the hustle and bustle, the sudden wind that suddenly rushes, let the passers-by avoid the eaves of the roadside buildings, the vendors are dissatisfied Blaming the ghost weather that hinders the making of money, he hurriedly covered the thick canvas onto the pavement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peiji lifted the silk shawl that slipped to the elbow, turned back, and walked to the carriage hundreds of steps in the usual pace of pace. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is ashamed of the weakness that has emerged. Whether it is education or tempering in reality, she is unmistakably telling her that people are allowed to occasionally Low tide, but never sink into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come on, a man who panicked and shunned the rain, and she almost fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pei Ji saw, squatting on the plainclothes guards not far away, the scared expression on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They open their mouths as if they are trying to call and rush towards themselves. It may be that the wind is too loud and the environment is noisy. Peggy did not hear what he was saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Breaking." She impatiently wanted to move on. However, he suddenly found a soft cotton pad on his legs, and there was a sharp pain in his waist. His eyes began to blur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was puzzled and touched, a warm, melted liquid, splashing clothes, and dyed the palms red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Assassin?" Peggy gasped and fell to the ground, and the cold rain fell on her face. Let her feel very cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Control the square... Don't be too nervous...to avoid causing public uneasiness...live catching..." She was weak and calm and reached several orders, then Consciousness sank into the dark, whirlpool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many major events that shocked the country were often facilitated by unknown little people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Busta is a martial art gangster. Everyday work is to follow the big glory of the road. At night, go to the small bar to find a good fool, or to gamble. The museum has a few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't owe a gambling debt, you will have a beautiful piece of jewelry, and you will be entangled in him every day. Busta will never come to Tiltin from Tirole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a task on the top, you have to go to Tantin to get rid of four people in a small theater. The reward is a thousand Caesar." That night. A familiar man finds him. "Do you accept this sale?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a big deal, but also to the capital. Too dangerous." Booth The tower is reluctant. "After the road, one thousand is not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case, one thousand six hundred and six hundred, and there is no need to completely follow it. "The guy smirked, "Slightly make something happen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Busta understands, it must be a certain rich, but with the underworld The boss who did not have much deep relationship found a big brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If murder. It is the true assassin's vocation, then the abduction is a good thing for the gangsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idiot, who doesn’t know the insider, confuses the Assassin’s organization with the ordinary gangsters who receive protection fees for a living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top wants to get the ticket, and is not willing to help the unrelated outsiders to make a big case that can cause the authorities to pay special attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking like this, one thousand and four hundred pieces are completely drawn, as long as he arrives in Tantin and finds the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of accidents such as car accidents, there is reason to say to the boss who sent the money, "I have tried my best, hey, that person is suffering, that is, we Dry land, but he is lucky enough. If you are not satisfied, then take the money, I will send someone to try again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try again, of course It is the last time to re-play it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the arrival of Tantin, after investigation, Busta discovered Some are not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is the target of a small troupe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the Red Bird Theatre, Sylvia, the actress, the Lauren playwright, and the Lord of the Knights, are all famous local celebrities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom, Laozi has been deceived, this thousand dollars can not be earned." Busta is difficult to ride the tiger, prepaid money, before he left Tyrolean It will be clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heihe Hotel is located in a prosperous way, people come and go, he has no chance to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Busta had to cast his gaze on the private suburb of Lord David, and he thought that he would put a fire at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as planned, avoiding the eye lines of the ashes, when preparing to start, the carriage coming out of the yard caught his attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the distance, Busta only saw a woman’s face and flashed at the window of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Silana or Julie?" He was thinking, and found the other side of the street, two police officers patrolling, and quickly dressed as if nothing had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrolman looked at his back in disbelief and snaked his eyes to cool Busta’s back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the corner, Busta was relieved. "There is no chance tonight." He thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, when he was frustrated shopping at the night market, he saw the very ordinary carriage on the surface. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mix of course is not eye-catching, the body of the carriage is inlaid from the most expensive purple pine, the axle is authentic, only for the military alloy steel pipe, In the corner of the outer compartment, the cleverly concealed in the decorative pattern, the red-yellow flower of the pinnate compound leaves, the meaning behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman who came out of the Lord’s house just jumped out of the car and headed for the night market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a pretty girl, probably the lover of the Lord, and the rich will enjoy it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Busta whispered softly, and in his inner pocket, he was putting a poisoned dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A confession that has used up the rewards, but it is not a big deal to explain the task, can not expect him to understand the pity and jade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take it, this is also the person associated with the goal, give her a knife, get out of the city immediately, no one can find me. Wait back to Tirole There is also a head-to-head difference. "Busta decided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably God is also helping him, the sudden rainstorm, gave a part-time killing mobile phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Busta did not find a plain-clothed plainclothes guard, and the Cavaliers were not, in a crowded crowd of people hiding from the rain, immediately alerted to a stranger The killing of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time killer hides the dagger in his sleeve, and Peggy, who is immersed in memories, walks away...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This works 16k novel network exclusive text version of the first release, without permission can not be reproduced, excerpts, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran on the second day, got the news that his prince was assassinated and his life was dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the serious injury, unable to withstand the bumps of the carriage, Peggy was sent to a small private hospital nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Guard blocked the entire street where the hospital was located and cleared all residents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Crown Prince who was awakened from his sleep, the royal doctor who was enshrined in the court, was too nervous to think that this was a high-ranking official who was involved in political murder. The most advanced medical equipment and medicines in the car, as well as the news reporters who were blocked by the news, were whispering farther away, and the curious citizens gathered here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sir, please stop." Fran arrived at the scene and was stopped by the guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a private consultant to His Royal Highness, what is her current status?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No comment, please leave." After checking Fran's documents, the guard's tone eased a bit, but still insisted on his duties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franland returned to the carriage, confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
