Tied up to the boat to Mamuk, the chiefs of the East will be happy to have a free slave. Second, you will leave a letter to the authorities stating that you want to go abroad to find a new life, willing to give up the current title, will be all Money and real estate, donated to charity, then I will give you a enough two-person living expenses to send you abroad, in this life, you don't come back to Byron."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris almost collapsed. Every time she heard a word, she trembled and shouted repeatedly. "Forgive me, forgive me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan Ironstone replied heartily, "You must choose a path."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl desperately fell to the ground, "...I don't want to go When I was a slave, I was willing to go abroad and start living again." She saw the other side thinking for a while and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a one-way ticket to the Principality of Portugal, the port is in the town of forty miles nearby. There are also four hundred baht debts. Volume.” Fran handed a small wallet and paper pen to Paris. “Write a donation letter, remember to put a private seal at the end, oh, the badge on your finger is still there.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the day was bright, Paris was released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a small, small road appeared in front of her, she couldn’t see the camp full of nightmares, and she was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Want to drive me out of the country? No way." She used her sleeves to wipe away the tear marks that had already dried up on her face. "Banui’s nephew does have me Well, at least from her, I learned realistic acting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still early, there’s no car on the road, and Paris is licking the painful ankle. Thinking maliciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dark shadow appeared in the distance, and it was getting closer and closer. Paris was delighted to see that it was black and had a police station mark. Light patrol police car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police car stopped at her side soon, "Miss. What happened to you?" The patrolman in the car poked his head and looked at the girl in confusion. Crumpled clothes, and muddy pants and shoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to call the police!" she exclaimed excitedly. "I am a nobleman with a baron status. I just escaped from a group of robbers and took me to the city. The robbers also seized my property. I have to immediately Go to the city government to re-write the statement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police immediately got nervous. "Kid a nobleman? This is a big case, you are on the train!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s finally safe." In the car, Paris sighed and hated. Hate biting his teeth. "You wait and see, the scammer pretends to be a prosecutor, and is wanted. I must tell this out, let the scorpions become accomplices, and eat more than a dozen. Year of the baby."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inadvertently. Paris found out. The route of the patrol police car is getting more and more off the avenue. There are wilderness and hills outside the window, and no other passers-by and car shelter can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are we going? Why haven't you been in town yet?" she asked inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A hidden port opened by smugglers. Ms." The gang member disguised as a patrolman is looking at her and laughing. "He told me to tell you." , opportunity, will only give people who really repent, Mamlok's slave field is waiting for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the end, she still has no regrets, He chose not to return."

If it wasn't for your anger in my chest, maybe now, I have already committed suicide and become a decaying body in the sea." Moore put his hand on his chest and said loudly, "I If you owe you, you will be unable to pay for it in your life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This person is trustworthy and grateful to you, so I recruited him." I also mentioned him in the letterhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's alright." Fran stood up and patted Moore's shoulder. "I can't stay for a long time. After you arrive in Tantin, you will see me." Friend Kasimodo Bo, you don't have to hide anything from him, and any of his orders are equivalent to my instructions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mour respect Bend down, picking Fran's left hand and kissing his back. "As you wish, my godfather."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray Shadow Valley is located in limestone Between the mountains, there is no depth of detail in the foothills on the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even this name is known to a small group of people, even the old-fashioned climbing family, it is impossible to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a flat land overgrown with clover and vines, surrounded by lush jungles and peaks. A manor with a mysterious veil is built on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout of the manor is not too large, covering an area of ​​about four acres, a few rows of thick pointed wooden fences are neatly placed on the grass, but these fences They are not connected in a circle, but in the image, they outline the periphery of the villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A villa-style building built of fine wood, a large warehouse with a long overall look, and a stable, stove, laundry room, and a robe in the manor around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to look around, the deserted mountains are quiet, the sun shines through the mottled clouds, and occasionally a few birds pass by in the air. In the early morning of the autumn, with the wind of grass and earthy taste, gently blew the curtain on the window railing of a villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Coleon lie on her soft bed, thinking about how to make a new day, books and magazines on the bedside coffee table, Already finished, the calm life is not suitable for her.
