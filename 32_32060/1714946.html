			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weeds are full of white flowers, and the public cemetery in the old area in the morning is very quiet. The damp air on the night makes the stone road hidden in the grass wet. The tombstone representing the deceased, and the vigorous calamus in the spring, constructed the pure land of the rest of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very early person came to the grave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grave sweeper is of medium build, and from the pace of walking through the moss through the ramp, he is at the golden age of energeticity, and the black woolen coat collar is facing up. Turning over, on the inside of the inconspicuous neckline, embroidered a small crow-like emblem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trousers of the lavender trousers are wrapped in long boots, and the soles of the boots are obviously nailed with metal sheets to prevent abrasion. The men seem to be afraid of the accident. The sleeping of the deceased, deliberately slow down, so as not to make a slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a small road, in the corner on the left, there are three new monuments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When life is stopped, eternity begins." The man stood in front of the black and white marble tombstone, put down the bouquet in his hand, and gently read the tomb. He took out his handkerchief and slowly, as in the solemn ceremony, wiped the tombstone and the dust on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the dead, it is indeed living in an eternal paradise, not tired, not knowing the pain," he murmured. "But for the living, even if It’s a dead and alive corpse, and you still have to experience the sadness and sorrow of feelings.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smog remaining in the morning fades away,喧嘈The vocals broke the silence of the cemetery. The man put the handkerchief on the bouquet and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since destruction and persecution began at the expense of money, then I will start the trial from the sinners who remain in the city." He thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual carnival festival is coming again, this time of the previous year, The church’s closure of the city has made the people of Feidu suffocate. Last year, the economy had not fully recovered, and there was no energy to increase investment in the festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So compared with the carnival of the previous two years, this year's grand scale can tell everyone: the prosperity of the city never comes back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A carriage pulled out from the street where the patrol hall is located, slowly moving through the crowd of people who celebrated in advance, usually only takes a quarter of an hour, and the carriage is honed For more than an hour, the coachman was relieved until he turned into Xiangshu Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now there are so many people, two days after the carnival, we can't do business." The coachman complained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the atmosphere of the carnival, the place to remain quiet, except for the square of the first court and the cathedral, only the Avenue of the Fragrant Trees known as the Golden Road . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the financial center of Feidu, and almost all bankers are here to start a business. This is also a symbol of identity. If a person in the financial circle can't get a room in Xiangshu Street and hang up a sign with his own name, in the eyes of customers, at least half of the reputation will be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those are wild." The bankers in Feidu always despise any credit station outside the Golden Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lifeline that can maintain the trading activities of Feidu, only Xiangshu Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are tens of millions of money circulating here every day. In order to ensure safety, the patrol hall specially arranged a team of patrolmen to patrol day and night. The guards of each firm and warehouse are long-tested and absolutely loyal people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can get half a dime from the sturdy guard of Xiangshu Street, and the bankers are all savvy, many fraudsters just If they want to slap on the door, they will be seen by them and sent to a single room without spending money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embedded between the major offices, the elegant coffee restaurant, at noon, is always crowded with the top financial masters, they enjoy The superb calf is squashed, and with a sigh of indifference, spit out a bunch of zero numbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone proudly said, "The horn ship last month wanted to find a loan of 100,000 yuan. The slowest person knows that this ship is going bankrupt. Of course, I refused. Fortunately, there was a foresight. The previous loan was recovered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, I politely complimented a few words, turned and showed off with other peers. "Good news can make a lot of money, the horn ship is quickly turning over, and its last ship got the best spices in the Far East." At present, I have safely returned to the airport. It is estimated that I will arrive in Feidu Port two days later. I have just loaned 200,000 Jin Caesar to the boat and 10% interest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In gold Road, the most prestigious office is the branch of the Imperial City Double Eagle Bank in Feidu, the double eagle is the first big bank of Byron, the financial network is full of the country, it issued the check, even the most cautious businessman There is no doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage stopped at the Double Eagle Feidu branch, the guard and waiter in front of the door, using the impeccable action, pulling the door open, a young man walking Come down and hand in a ticket to the guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard respectfully expressed his gratitude, waiting for him to sneak a sneak peek at the ticket in his hand, could not help but take a breath, it was a gold coin with a face value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff in the bank lobby watched the man who had just stepped in and dressed up, and the girl’s staff cheered in the heart. "Hey, this is the prince of which country, even if No, it should be the son of a duke's family. Only with this identity can he be worthy of his face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need a hosting service. The man smiled and said to a female salesperson behind the counter that the smile immediately made the salesperson blush a little dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh... Of course, I am going..." The saleswoman was stuttering, but she immediately remembered the bank’s system. "Sorry, can you inquire, you What kind of items and what kind of service to store."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A painting, I need the most advanced safe." The man raised a tarpaulin Rectangular clips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most advanced? Please wait a moment, I will inform you of President Deborah." The female salesperson realized that this was a big deal, "no wonder, Look at his appearance, not the small staff we can receive." She thought resentfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the bank's business, the rental safe is divided into three grades, the highest level, which is equivalent to renting a small vault with a guard, the daily rent is up to Three hundred gold Caesars are generally filled with precious art and treasures that rich people do not care about at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Deborah walked out of the office and personally received the young rich man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rent is not a big deal for the bank, but only the most expensive luxury customers will choose this business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can satisfy them, you will not be allowed to deposit large sums of money next time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the office, the man gracefully picked up the coffee and sipped his mouth. He seemed to be dissatisfied with the taste of the coffee. He quickly put the cup down and looked at the president. Waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deborah immediately realized that this is a common arrogance of noble people, and they never introduce themselves when dealing with strangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am May Deborah, the president of the Bank." He smiled awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Van Gly." The man nodded and replied, he said the Byron language, the voice was clear, with a slightly different accent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a very surprising name. Deborah has never heard of a rich man named this, it is probably a pseudonym, but this man can’t get rid of it. The aristocratic habits still reveal the inside story, Fan, only in the name of the prince of the Portuguese-Portuguese kingdom in the west, the name is only qualified to add the word "fan". <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some princes, like to engage in micro-service travel, so it is more convenient for them to act without jealousy, seduce some poor-born, and growable farmer girls. When the time went away, the girls who were ruined could not be traced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by these reasons, Deborah is not sure whether he thinks correctly. He looks at the man, is elegant, has received a good education, and is strong but Not a muscular horror, indicating that he often performs aristocratic sports such as fencing hunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark clothes are not arrogant, even ordinary. Only those who have frequent exposure to the upper social circle can see its value.瞧 Fabric and hand-made, the button of the light cuffs, the governor knows, at least six hundred gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the ring on the finger is unpretentious, and the president can’t see anything famous, but the person dressed in it may not be expensive. The president can only think that his knowledge is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as a man, Deborah must also admit that this young man is really handsome, especially the black eyelids and the slightly light brown chestnut hair, which makes him full of exotic mysterious taste, the mouth is always inadvertently revealing a little mean The vortex, the noble son of a big family. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "this guy, do not even have to spend money, just hook the little finger, there will be a girl gestures." Deborah jealous to think. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "I just bought a painting, but can not feel at ease in the hotel, I need to rent ......" Grameen man claiming to gently clasp the chair with your fingers along, "ten days until I return home." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;? "picture if I may take the liberty, just a picture, does not seem to be worth the most advanced ... ..." The president said half, was interrupted by Gry with a smirk, and he proudly said, "Dach's work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deborah In other words, Daqi, the most famous master of painting in history, his famous masterpieces can make every collector who loves art go crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the master’s well-known paintings are usually collected in the palaces or national exhibition halls of various countries. Deborah suddenly understood that this is a black market transaction. Products, masters have a lot of famous paintings have been stolen, those thieves want to shoot, can only be circulated from the underground market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that this gentleman bought one of the dirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the president will not offend a potential big client for this trivial matter, he did not ask interestingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This painting cost me 150,000. Actually, I don't know how to paint, just to fight with people at the auction." Gly said, it seems Showing off 150,000 for him is nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150,000! Thanks to the achievements of the ancestors, the brother-in-law who is drunk and dreaming of death can spend 150,000 for the sake of fighting! Deborah is even more embarrassed, the position of the bank president, the annual salary is 20,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although every banker in Golden Road meets him, he will say hello respectfully, but he knows that he is just a wage earner, and the bank’s earnings belong to the head office of Tantin. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of millions of money flowed out of his hand and entered the account, but except for the annuity, there was no dime to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Deborah did not show his dark mind. "I immediately arranged the best treasury."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray nodded and placed the clip on the desk On, "Draw here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please wait a moment, I will let the senior appraiser of the bank come over. Please apologize, this is the system, not that I have Even if he doesn't believe it, Deborah said that he is still very cautious. According to the rules, if the deposit is damaged, the bank will pay the original price. In case the man deliberately saves a fake painting, he will take a bite after receiving it in 10 days. Accused the bank to adjust the package, it can be a big loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Greg doesn't mind, "The strict rules have made me more trust in your business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appraiser carefully opened the outer tarpaulin, and the extremely beautiful frame was inlaid with a sketch of only half the color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used a long time to appreciate the painting, "Hey, sir, this is the master of the early days, the painting skills are not mature, and still Semi-finished products, which are worth only 10,000 pieces in the market."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ten thousand pieces?" Glye jumped up from the chair in surprise. "This is Dach." Works! I spent 150,000!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, sir, I actually count the value of the frame." The answer, "The master's famous painting is measured by money. It is an insult to art, but it does not mean that even the master's essays are worth the price. If there is no signature on the canvas, this semi-finished product is worthless. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray is a little angry, "Damn, I am fooled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deborah gloating I thought, "Look, this kind of ignorant who doesn't know how to do it, and who likes to spend money, should be deceived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president’s eyes seem to be To their own loss of grace, he sat down again, "Is not it one hundred and fifty thousand, little money is nothing, I still choose the highest deposit and other services." He pretended not care, but Deborah know, the black sheep in a fit of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With three thousand pieces to save only 10,000 pieces, only this kind of son can get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
