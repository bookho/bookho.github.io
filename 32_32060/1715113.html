			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.We already know that before the Royal Emperor of Byron, there was a special action department called Blood Knight, whose duty was to protect the royal family and fight against the country. It involves the uneasy factors of mysterious power and the supernatural madmen who have seriously affected law and order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince Cooper is currently taking over the command of the Special Operations Team, and has assembled the police, navy, and land fire rifle forces, laying down the nets, and the entire Golden Horn Bay surface. The calm was restored, but the trend was surging. The whereabouts of the imperial prince did not have any reliable news. The prince’s face was gone, which was not only related to personal honor, but also implicated in the face of the whole country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two months passed, the prince felt like a snail crawling only in the fog. He was slow and could not recognize the direction. Countermeasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only a handful of powerful powers in the mainland, but there is no way for a sly kidnapper in the district? The envoys of the other countries' Byron embassy visited and expressed their condolences, but the prince could feel the sneer of those people hiding behind their expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the emperor’s letter, the letter of urging one is more urgent than the one, in the latest secret letter, even angrily shouted, "I want people, give You have the right, you don’t want to be arrogant, but what about the result? Is it necessary to have a chance to rescue the Prince of the Union, the heir to the Empire?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince has not had much time. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows the art of commanding subordinates. If the boss is panicked, then the subordinates are even more helpless, so the prince’s face is well-prepared, and he will be anxiously concealed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he is also extremely suspicious. How can a gangster who can escape such a search be a simple character, and will never be an ordinary gangster or a madman, if The enemy did not control the great power and should have fallen into the French Open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it ...... gorse?" Prince Cooper came up with this idea more than once, and the whereabouts of the prince were unknown, according to the biggest beneficiary. Inferred that there was any accident in the throne. The object that can get the most benefit from politics can only be the family that has the power to fight against the heavens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, unlike the gorse, the gorse has been slowly and steadily holding the power in its hands. The seats in the parliament, the political marriage, and the bureaucratic squads of all levels are inserted and drawn. They always do nothing in the ritual law and act on terror. It can be said that it is a strange move, and the risk is too great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violence, assassination, kidnapping. Only the weaker side will take the risk when trying to make a comeback. Even if it is a success, the reputation and reputation will be finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politics is always a hypocrite who wears a mask and looks like a demeanor. When you have to take off your mask and reveal the filth of the naked, you will also be yourself. Excluded from the political system, become a public enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sinister and sophisticated Duke of the Reinschmann family does not need to use this wrist, the gorse is strong. It is dependent on the contradiction between the royal family and the aristocratic class. If they are so naive to use the rebellious way to achieve the highest authority, no one in Byron will stand on the side of the monarch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor who can now suppress the ambitions of the great aristocracy is old and weak, and the heirs recognized by the heirs are weak. The reservoir is a woman from the home of the gorse, at least on the surface, and Reinschmann has stepped closer to the top of the right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is impossible for them, this is equivalent to having built a safe bridge above the rapids, but the climbers have to swim past, which is not common sense." Prince Cooper shrugged, to be honest, he could not wait to find clues, and the ironclad proof of the chaos in these months was a conspiracy of the gorse family. The royal family can take the opportunity to clean the thorns in the nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his thoughts around, and instead of thinking about unrealistic things, it’s better to put your energy in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the corridor of the office slammed, and a curtain hurried into the office, holding a letter in his hand, "Lord You should look at this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince took care of it casually, probably the new information that the secret agent had released. He had seen too much during this time. The spies in the security hall are all group of pigs, and there are always some gossips that are catching the wind and catching the wind. They are both incompetent and frustrating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have clues about the whereabouts of Chu Jun and the black hands behind the scenes, and are loyal to the royal family. The situation is urgent, I only believe in the commitment of the highest responsible person.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are willing to cooperate, please change the curtain on the far right of the third floor of the city government building to yellow. I will contact you further after seeing the reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please remember that for reasons of self-security, if this matter is disclosed, I will unilaterally cancel the follow-up contact. Pay tribute. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content is all pieced together by the typeface cut in the newspaper, and the writing on the envelope is skewed and seems to be written in the left hand.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payment is Jack (jad). In Byron, the word also has the meaning of "豺狼". As a person's name is very common, obviously a pseudonym.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince knocked on the table without expression, and read this mysterious letter several times. He asked, "Do you know who sent it?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have inquired about the department dealing with daily letterheads and documents, which was sent in a bunch of ordinary letters. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, how many people have read this letter? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to you and me, there is a clerical staff in the clerical department." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warning the clerk, you must not reveal half a word to the outside world." "The Prince ordered, "And, change the curtain of the office on the third floor, we have to give this gentleman a friendly reply. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may also be a clown joke. "The curtain reminds, "We can't believe one, the one who hides the tail. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince is also clear, but he can't let his subordinates know that he is in trouble now, and now he has the roots of straw floating in front of him, even if his origin is unknown, he I have to try it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feidu’s climate in the early autumn has always been criticized, and the rain has often caused the citizens to linger in less than a week, the wheels are splashing out. Mud, dressed in tarpaulin raincoats, hurrying crowds, and cold weather like winter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Wolf sits at a table in a cafe leaning against the window With a steaming black coffee, he squinted and wiped the glass window with his hands covered with fog due to the temperature in the room, looking out into the distance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;A large building separated by a main road and a square is the political core of the city government building and Feidu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He caught sight of the right side of the third floor of the building, hung with a touch of yellow, nodded lightly, called the waiter, and left the checkout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince expected that the mysterious sender would appear nearby. More than a dozen plainclothes spies have been dispatched, and they are vigilantly scanning around to try to identify any suspicious person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a secret agent who saw the door of the coffee shop not far away, a man with a silver foil crutches and a white-haired old gentleman standing under the canopy in the foyer. I am trying to open the umbrella. "Oh, this bad weather. I also want to have a cup of hot." The agent groaned in his heart and continued to search for objects that did not know if they existed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A arrogant and intelligent woman always thinks that she can see through everything, her character defects make her proud, but she has left behind the truth behind the falsehood. Fran Flair thought when he walked into the gate. The cold rain is connected to the fine silk thread, which is falling from the gloomy night. The flowers on both sides of the path tremble like timid, and the rainwater accumulated on the shrub leaves is more and more, and the whole branch is often pressed downwards, then immediately There are countless drops of water splashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullen took off the gloves. Take off your wet hat and coat. Throw it to Julian who is greeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clothes filled with water are as heavy as a piece of iron, but Julian is caught lightly, as if it was a soft satin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This girl is really trained in physical fitness." Fran's dark village walked in the direction. From the body to the ground water, ticking the red blankets in the foyer to wet, leaving a row of water on the smooth floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he had to secretly arrange his wife and Zolfa Longch, he returned to Black Swan Castle three days later than the reserve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little maid Juan Lidi hangs innocently on her face and greets warmly, "Master, because I don’t know if you will return today, no extra preparation Dinner, I will let the kitchen do it right away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't need to be so troublesome. If there are any leftovers, it's just a hot spot." Fran replied, he was cold and hungry. It was not a comfortable experience to ride a horse for hours in heavy rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wreckage is just a nominal rhetoric. In fact, after 10 minutes, the straw mushroom in front of Fran is stewed with fresh fish, omelettes, and steaming. The soup is very delicious. Julian is standing on the side of the man, holding a knife and buttering the bread. The girl is careful. "The hot water is already hot. My Highness will let me tell the owner. She wants to see you. After you have finished the grooming, you can go directly to the study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran nod After he had used the meal, he spent a quarter of an hour in the bath, warming from the inside out, sweeping away the fatigue caused by cold and humidity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already clean clothes on the hangers at the entrance of the bath. The underwear is baked on the stove and will not let the cold cloth directly stimulate the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her character is weird." Fran frowned, he couldn’t see Julian, and by the way, this girl was absolutely first-rate. The maid, careful and thoughtful, only the princely family trained, but Fran believes that she is not only a servant and ordinary in the eyes of Peggy. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the time of the storage and his departure from the Black Swan Castle, all the secret affairs were arranged by Julian, to control the overall situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This black-haired lace maid suit, the girl who always has a sewing kit in her pocket, is simply the head of Peggy’s intelligence, at least in the private sector. A very important part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lilian seems to be very keen on housekeeping, the demeanor of the model maid, and the usual impression of being hidden in the dark, insidious spies, these two images Overlapping, giving Fran a strange feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sorted out his clothes, put on his boots, picked up his umbrella, and left the suspicion of Julian’s suspicion for a moment, and walked along the road toward the main building. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy likes to place his home in a more private atmosphere, and the safe firearms camps are all stationed on the outskirts of the castle, presenting a pattern of tight outer pines. Fran only saw a few busy servants in the house. He asked a few words and determined that the coffin was still in the study room and walked up the second floor with the winding staircase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tapped on the door of the room, and did not respond. The store was not a girl who was also cumbersome in private, so Fran directly pushed the door inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner here curled up on the sofa in front of the fireplace, facing away from the porch, only showing his hair, as if he didn’t hear anyone coming in, "His Royal Highness?" Fran doubts Asked, after waiting a few seconds, he shrugged and Peggy seemed to fall asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowed down and walked slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missy is wearing a plain loose shirt with her feet folded over the sofa that is deep in the print cover, her hands clasped around her chest, slightly curled The hair was loosely scattered on the narrow shoulders, and a book spread out lying quietly on the elbow. The fire in the fireplace was burning, and the light of the red plum blossoms on the face of the girl's white face. Because of the warmth of the warmth, there was a faint blush on the cheeks. Eyelashes are eye-catching, and the thick eyelashes seem to be shaking gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran quietly sat on the side of the sofa, squinting his head, a hand column on the side of the face, staring at the girl with a look of gaze. Looking at the lingering shackles in this life, he wants to sin from her face to the ugly ugly ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peiji is alive and well. There is a force and iron between the eyebrows. When she sleeps quietly, the lines of her face are softer, even with a half-unexpected docile, the skin is white and transparent, almost seeing the blood vessels of the blue, "Hey, look at it." This body is nothing more than a small woman, which looks harmless to humans and animals. But the things in the skull are vicious. When the sinful brain is active, she is just a cold and deadly devil." Fran thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You ruined me, I will repay it." His dark eyes had a turbulent current. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gloomy WISP. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his life, this woman occupies an extremely important position, just like his wife, but Anmei is beautiful and warm, but she is Evil and cold shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burst of silence in the room, only the "squeaky" muffled sound from time to time in the fireplace, the man leaned forward, subconsciously reaching out and sticking the girl to the buccal side The hair of the hair was gently picked up and I wanted to make this face clearer and more thorough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" Fran looked at Missy and squinted. I happened to return from my dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two face each other, Fran has no time to recover their own hands, the girl has felt the temperature brought by the touch of the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He realized that his actions were inevitably rash and reckless, and he was caught. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of action makes people look very embarrassed, especially the object status is honorable, and with this, it can make him suffer big trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long have you not been with a woman?" Peggy pouted, yawning lazily, still leaning against the mat. The eyelids looked at it with interest. "Do you have a ** on me?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I still don't wake up, you will continue, lips, Neck, chest..." She used her fingers to caress the outline of her figure. The content of the words was teasing, but the tone was faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please forgive me for taking the liberty." Fran answered indifferently, "You can understand that the gentleman should love the lady."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forgiveness? If you violate the laws of the East and offend the female lord, at least it is also a palace punishment, it is a kind of ingenious castration, letting people live while taking away his male self-esteem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not the East, you are not my master, please don't confuse friendship with slavery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bold, you sneak like a chicken, but don't admit the fox after drying your mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please don't say I seem to have stolen your feelings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, the two people’s conversations are moving in an outrageous direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy put her elbows on the armrests, staring at Fran, her eyes suddenly leaping from the sofa, standing in front of the man With the finger on the chin, it seems to think about something, and then the girl snapped a finger. "Well, then let's examine the correct meaning of the word cheating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;; Fran is an imaginative man, but he did not expect that this scene will be entangled between himself and Peggy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byron's storeman was sitting on his knees at the moment, ringing his neck, pressing his head hard, pressing his lips against him, and the warm, moist tongue tipped the man's lips and licked it. Open his teeth, and gradually deepen like a muddy, blowing the man's neck and ears, and the air trembles with the trembled breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a hint of mint on her body, her tongue is clumsy and curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kiss lasted less than ten seconds, and Peggy slid the palm of his hand against the man’s chest and calmly described it, “ The exchange between saliva is quite disgusting. The monkeys like to play this trick. According to the book, the kiss can make the heart beat unnaturally, can make the legs soft, and can produce a feverish sputum. I thought it should be More pleasant, but I didn't think it was boring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also asked Fran, "You think so, because I didn't feel your strength." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran has recovered from the initial shock, and he is not sure why the girl is doing this unreasonable thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he spoke, Missy waved her hand. "Don’t worry, it’s a joke." She pointed at the door with arrogance. "Okay, Bo Lord Knight, you are a lucky one, you kissed Wang Hao without paying any punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Julian sneaked into the study, Peggy was stroking herself The red lips, slightly swollen, her organ that was licking her lips was really delicate, and asked the intelligence leader, "What reaction does the man have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking at the face, tightening the brow." Yan Lian replied, "Please excuse me, you should have a better choice for your Highness, at least find a handsome point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Strong, smart, enough, and this is just a backup plan, the current situation has not yet reached this step, I just rehearsed the process in advance." Peggy said, "everything has to press the most The bad direction is that if Julius is really surprised, I have to have a child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worrying your hair with trouble, "Cucumber or fingers can solve the identity of the **, but can't make a child. In the end, you can only rely on a man who can grasp it and won't cause me too much resentment."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
