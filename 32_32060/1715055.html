			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. "You are scared to death! I have slept for five days!" Barry gasped aloud as if she was going to pour out all the depression in her chest. She sat. On the bedside, take a towel on Fran's forehead and whisper, "Would you like water?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I feel much better." Fran He said that he looked at the head of the head, deep dark circles, and said with apologies, "You have been taking care of me these days, it’s really hard for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, anyway, Nicole and Lauren hosted the overall situation of the troupe in this period, I am free." Baru patted the chest and put on a very spirited look, she then said sadly. "What is this about you? I have never heard of it. There will be such a sickness for a few days. Are you too tired recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Possible Well, it seems that at the right time, I really have to take a good rest for a while." Fran answered, he looked at the room, "Where is William Master?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" you It’s a saying, Mr. Shi, it’s amazing, the mysterious instruments that he moved to the house, I have never seen it.” As soon as he mentioned William, Barry immediately got excited and she saw Fran’s thoughts. Climb down from the bed and stop immediately. "You continue to lie down, I will call him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My body is gone."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not up to you, the patient must lie down." Barry issued a command, quite a bit of the hostess's posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five minutes later, William walked in with a large stack of drawings, his beard with his face, his eyes smashed into a seam, and he walked and struggled, obviously 熬A few nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's talk, I'm downstairs, if you need anything, just scream." Barry gently closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," said Fran. "I remember that compared with the last time, the time spent sleeping is getting longer and longer, which affects my plan too. If you attack at the most critical moment as follows, it will push me to the path of failure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard will open the drawings in his hand, which is full of different colors. The wavy lines are next to each line. Densely annotated with various values. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For five days, I have been using magic instruments to track the various energy sources in your body." William stroked the wavy lines with his fingers. "I must say that you are the most exotic human in this world. You are the reason Being alive is entirely because of the sacred object of the Eternal Cabinet, the energy left in the body. It is the source of your fresh life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know all of this." Fran nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you say that if you use the most popular explanation, you are a big water bottle." The Master painted with his hand. "And those energies are loaded." The liquid in the bottle. If you don't have this carrier, the Holy Spirit will disappear like the water in the sun, and you will survive by the Holy Power. But the water in the bottle is limited. Think about it, before you stun every time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have you done? Do you have anything in common?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Fran recalled, "The first time, it was in the city of São Paulo. The second time, it was wanted, and the west fled to the Golden Horn Bay. As for the common point, if this time..." he sighed. To breathe, "I think I already knew it, but I didn't pay attention to it. Every time before I went to sleep, I used the Holy Power to save people who are dying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Balance. Yes, this is what I want to say." William shouted. "You have a heavy object called death on your water bottle, only by the bottle. The amount of water can only maintain balance. After all, you are not a steady stream of eternal cabinets. Every time you use the Holy Power, you will consume a part of the water in the bottle. Holy force must find the balance point again to continue to maintain your Life, this is why you go to sleep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you continue this way, when the water is wasted, or only a little bit left, you, again An empty bottle that cannot be balanced will be overwhelmed by the weight of death, and it will be broken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although I don't think saving lives is a waste, But I have to admit that it is indeed a bit of a splurge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fran, my friend, I am just a lame mage, can't create a good and holy The same strength to supplement your consumption." William is very serious, "If you don't want to become a cold body again, I have only one suggestion, don't use your little remaining power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promise that I will never die before the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William smiled. "Well, I am still waiting for your revenge, come to me." The lab, you know, there is no assistant in the world like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, by the time, we will transform your ultimate The technique was completely completed." Fran also smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all said the promise that might not be possible, so that the smile was bitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My coma, no one should know it outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I keep confidential Very good, except for the pretty lady downstairs, everyone thought we were studying...” The mage thought for a moment, “Magic amplitude medicine. The result was that the old liar Berry, who also found me specifically, wanted to get one. Bottle, to complete his powerful summoning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There must be a reason to explain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The reason is already ready." William pulled out a small bottle of blue liquid with bubbles from his pocket. "This is the result we have achieved in five days."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A small lizard tail powder, three ounces of purified sputum pus, plus A spoonful of bitter flower oil." William laughed with a beard and laughed. "The liar is always cheap for me. This time it is my turn to retaliate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What will happen if you drink this strange thing?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William made a funny face, "God knows, anyway, no poison, let the old things pull for a few days. Then announced again, after the court The Master’s personal experiment, the study of the magic amplitude medicine ended in failure.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between William and Bury is indeed very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of friendship formed by mutual mischief and taking advantage of money is the most difficult to destroy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan shook his head with a funny smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
