The torturer finally stopped his movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl sobbed and looked very scared. "I... I am a subordinate of the Western Bulls..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Bulls Boss?" Ann Corleone was a little funny and thought of the name that sounded rustic and lame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you come to the limestone mountains for what purpose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because..." The tower lowered her head and her eyes flashed through a ray of conspiracy. She jerked up the gun that had been held in her hand and fired three shots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Coleon was struck by the impact and retreated a few steps. She looked puzzled at the bullet hole on her clothes. "Isn't there any bullets?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what the strength of the Dragon Maiden is, but powerful people tend to be superstitious about their own abilities, thinking that everything is in their own hands. In fact, you don’t know how many shots the other party has made to judge whether the ammunition is exhausted.” Lauvita said that she just used her talent to make the pistol temporarily malfunction and to confuse the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't lie, and I didn't hide other weapons." Lauvita smiled smugly, but soon, the smile solidified on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't lie, the rank of the lord, there is no way to challenge the king. And before, I was hurt by a nasty samurai gun, so "I am very concerned about my own defense." Ann Corleone replied that the three bullets had not been able to get into the skin before, and they were wrapped in strange black air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of black gas, like the most corrosive acid cloud in hell, biting and melting the bullet into a broken residue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I don't know what tricks you have played." Her voice is full of anger. "But it doesn't matter, the organization has several dragons who can hypnotize the brain." The fox that is licking again will swear the truth. Even when he and his husband have been there four times, they will all speak out... Husband?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four times? What does it mean? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troublesome headaches and confusing scene fragments are always uncomfortable to disturb Ann Coleon.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautita no longer hesitates, staring at the female devil inexplicably stunned. Turned and ran.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night finally came down <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl didn’t know how long she ran until she couldn’t see the road between the mountains.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She I don't dare to use the streetlights, for fear that the light will lead to the soldiers. But in the head, I am so scared. "I don't know if it was a sudden drop in temperature at night, or if I was deeply planted in my heart, Loretta trembled violently and squeaked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has only one Thoughts, leave here quickly. Go to Tantin and tell the Fran about the enemy's intelligence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her estimation, the strength of the movie king is beyond the power of common sense, even if only The devil alone is enough to sweep the entire gang.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very good, still able to keep a clear head and make the most reasonable choices in times of crisis. If you change someone else, it is estimated that you will die in your hands. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita shuddered back, in the dark, the female demon figure. Like a nightmare.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Let's say the last time. Dragonmaids are always compassionate to the same kind, if you are willing to stop the resistance, after receiving the necessary checks. Will arrange according to your own wishes. If you are willing to stay, I can choose a good location for you. If you want to live an ordinary life, you only need to stay in the base for a period of time, so as not to disclose the organization during the current critical period. Secret and existence. "The voice is in the dark, faintly coming. "If you have to stand on my hostile side, then I will only send you a ride." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautita knows how to choose. In the face of enemies beyond imagination, choosing to yield is not too weak.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the girl is not confident, and can hide the secrets in her mind before the magical power of the other.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are told that someone is chasing the shadow king, it will lead to a huge danger to the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled grinningly and leaned back. Then I slammed into the air and fell off a cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Paris Dalmark, has been taken to the place of appointment. It is up to you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; As for Zall Law Lung, I am sure that he has fled to the limestone mountain range. Now I am leading the team to stay in the town at the foot of the mountain. After preparing for a little replenishment, I immediately enter the mountain. He wants to return to Tan. Ding, I will retaliate against you. Even if I die, I will not let him complete his plan.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the task is completed, don’t forget to promise me, let I came to Tantin and came back to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan read this letter five days ago, he closed the letter paper, folded it, put it Go to the lighter and watch the yellow and blue flames devour it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lautita carries ten people, and she is flexible. I don't worry about what Dagger can play anymore, just worry, there will be any accidents. For example, the bad weather in the mountains, such as all kinds of unpredictable accidents..." He shook his head and stunned his uneasiness from his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wind that blows in from the window, will leave the paper ash left after burning, full of room, those black ashes, as if gloomy Spiritual spirit, dancing in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! In the early morning, Fran went to the Heihe Hotel and came to the top floor that was chartered by the troupe. He was yawning and glanced at the small Cecilia. When he saw him, he screamed and flung into Fran's arms, and he refused to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big man, you are here, I haven't seen Metta's sister for a long time, I miss her very much." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She and Matida's feelings are really good, just like the sisters." Barrie came over with a cup of fragrant coffee, laughing, and she looked enviously at the orc girl with her hands. Lan's neck, treat him as a big toy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I am younger, I can be like Cecilia..." She ate an inexplicable flying vinegar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter with you." Fran licked his head and didn't comb it, messed up into a group of hair, and strangely looked at the head of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, nothing. I just want to think that I have time to bring Matilda out of the sanatorium and go out in the wild together." Barry tried to make her face The slightest heat subsided, and she noticed at this time that Fran had a small suitcase in her hand. "Where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a commercial contract for the construction line to be dealt with, I will get a trip to the city."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Day, after three days, you will accept the martial arts ceremony, can you get it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The road is not long, I am riding a cut wind, but it is a great fast horse. It is estimated that I will be back in less than two days.” Fran answered, he saw that Barry was still not at ease, so he smiled and comforted, “Although I don’t value the so-called The title of the Earl, but there is no reason to ignore the royal shrine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just worried, you will disappear again..." Barry's face suddenly emerged A few worries, "The last time, you said, you will return after two years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran hasn’t had time to say anything, just listen to Nicole. The screams came from the rehearsal room next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lauren, killing me, I don’t wear this damn costume, and these sparkling color films are really tasteless."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the script, such clothing is in line with the mentality of the early stage of the drama."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren argued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you are a big man, my reputation will be completely destroyed by this dress." "Okay, my dear lady, actually you wear everything." Look good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
