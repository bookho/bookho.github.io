Listening to the habitual bickering of the two, Fran smiled, the atmosphere of the troupe was the only place where he could feel warm and peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to go, but promise, come back two days later." He put Cecilia down from his arms and promised to Barry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking down from the corridor window, the head of the team saw him hanging his suitcase on the saddle, riding the horse, and soon disappeared into the bustling crowd on the street. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the distance with ecstasy, looking at the people who were no longer in sight, until the skirt was pulled a few times before they came back. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aunt Barrie, it’s time to have breakfast, I called you several times, and didn’t answer people." Cecilia complained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh my mind, let's go, what do you want to eat today?" said Barry, then leaned down and warned seriously, "said several times." I want to call my sister! Sister!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Little girl nodded. "Sister Barrie, where the big uncle is going, when will I come back?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He went to talk about business... Wait, your name is Uncle Casimodo?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I am small, I still know how to be polite, Ma Tida is my sister, then her father, of course, should call his uncle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You still call me an aunt." Barry turned his neck unnaturally, seeing no one noticed their conversation, so he was a little shy and sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia touched his nose and was completely confused by the change of the head of the group and the messy names. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-eight hours later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightfall in the mountains is burning a pile of bonfires, and the amphibious horse-drawn carriages are surrounded by a large circle, forming a simple camp. . Several tents covered with ordinary plastic sheets were placed side by side in the back half of the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris Dalmark felt that she was going crazy. Her hair cut by a famous teacher was like a chicken coop. She hadn’t taken a bath for five days. The clothes were full of stench. It was very itchy. It made me accustomed to neatness. She is unbearable.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am willing to pay a ransom, as much as you can, as long as you let me go." "Paris didn't know how many times she said it, but nobody cares. Even the valuable jewelry on her body has not been taken away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris remembered the rescue I passed her, but she abandoned herself to the secretary of the Longchi in the wild. "You have offended people who are very big. I think they are not for money, but want to retaliate against you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary has said this to her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kidnappers are guarded and strict. Throwed into the car, a wooden board and decorations are cleverly blocked. From the outside, the narrow, dark room is seamless. In the evening, it is bundled and sturdy. It is held in a tent alone. Every half hour, someone will come in and check it out. Even the food and drink will not untie the ropes. The kidnappers also gave her a calming drug that made her weak and several times.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;帕Lisming Ming heard that the team was entering the town. There was a patrolman coming over for routine inspection, but she was not able to make a cry for help.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tandinger Knight Building The Bay Branch..." The patrolman read the name of the company on the pass.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we are going to the capital. Help the boss to do a big project. Someone answered with a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Confirmation is correct, gentlemen, you can go, I wish you all the best." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time, the idiot police did not find that there was a poor meat ticket in the car.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I must escape, this group of slag is broken, I dare to treat me like this, treat a distinguished Baroness!" She swears that as long as she can return to the city of Tyrol, she must use all the relationships, send the kidnappers to the death penalty, and the police on duty along the way, and also have to pursue the crime of negligence.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts roll over, Paris heard a noisy outside the tent, and then the messy voice turned into a shout of respect. "Hey, you are coming." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about people?" asked the mysterious head. The voice is low and the pure Byron accent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason, the female baron felt as if she had heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just here, please follow me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris is looking forward uneasily Finally, I have to meet the leader of the kidnappers. Maybe she can negotiate and take out more than 100,000 tickets. Maybe it will be more, as long as they can let go of themselves...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cloth that blocks the eyes is taken away. "Please, please, how much you need to open your mouth..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the open The tents were everywhere, and the fire came in, so that Paris could not adapt to the light for a while. After her vision gradually returned to normal, the pleading turned into a shocking cry. "You... you are posing in the west as Karl Tidy." Text, help me win the lawsuit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I haven’t seen you for a long time, madam." Fran waved the gang members out of the tent. Then he sat on a wooden bench and looked at Paris, who had worked with the troupe, deceived him, and used his girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indifference to the eyes of the serpent allowed Paris to move his ass in fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., I think... there must be a misunderstanding between us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Misunderstanding? Miss Lis, please don't hide in front of me, the crime you committed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I don't know what you are talking about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let me remind you, a month ago, you commissioned Tyrol’s gang leader Fitch, what did you do?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris suddenly realized that she finally remembered that she wanted to buy a murderous member of the Cardinals Troupe. It must be that the gang had leaked the wind, Casimodo, or Barry. The old woman wants to avenge her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! The ugly rotten meat! And the scorpion!" Paris thought bitterly, but the situation in front of her made her have to grieve The tone of voice asked, "I... I was only indignant. In fact, I regretted it afterwards. Fortunately, nothing happened... I spared it. I took 50,000 pieces to make up for the loss of the troupe..." The girl looked around. The man’s eyes whispered in a wink, “100,000 is also.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
