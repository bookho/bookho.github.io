			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.This is a must-have lawsuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan has been arguing for a long time, and he thinks so for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, it’s the enemy who wins the battle, behind it, is a temporary ally with no sincerity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From last night, he felt a little uncomfortable. When he got up today, his limbs were tied with lead, such as patients with rheumatism, taking a few steps. They are quite strenuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe it is the reason for staying up late, hold on." Fran thought, he only slept for three hours, and the documents at the table cost him a lot of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At breakfast, Fran’s exception was to drink a pot full of ground coffee to make the spirit more refreshing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palis ate his bread in a listless manner, he could see the fear from the girl’s eyes and...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hungry, "Sir, when will I go to court?" she asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Depending on the situation." Fran answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small actors who are behind the troupe of the troupe are disdainful in the eyes of the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will change your destiny." Fran continued to pour coffee into the cup, and the light smoke was steamed from the brownish black liquid with irritating The special scent of sex is lazy in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the trial, the lawyers group received a notice from the court, and the other party changed the candidate for the prosecutor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer’s representative taunted, “There is a poor person to be fooled! Bai Tutai wants to protect his fame, then he has to have a lamb. To bear the failure for him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the lawyers laugh aloud, "solve within an hour", they think with confidence, and then they can With generous rewards, add a bunch of seemingly beautiful numbers to your bank account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, they said: "Wait for a court session, don't give him a color to see if you can't. But I hope that the new prosecution function will resist more. Without a suspenseful defense, I can't afford it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragons are concentrated, and the ten fingers project lines that are unrecognizable to the naked eye, such as operating puppets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the old baron's corpse walk and talk with his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Puppet Master" is his nickname in the underground world. In many fraud cases, his ability played a vital role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time he is also a confidant of Igo Andech, Igo has been showing good to the big lady of the gorse, but the result is a cold reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really don't know, that kid is her old lover." The gangster complained more than once, "Although our master is the Grand Duke of Leinschmann Your Excellency. But it is not a good thing to offend his most valued daughter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this success will make the relationship better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Baron’s body has a slight smell, the internal organs begin to spoil, and the perfume must be covered with a nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of contemporary doctors have proposed that hygiene and bathing have no harm to the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But some old people still follow the old tradition and only take three baths in their lifetime: birth, marriage and death. Even if you can't do it, you can only bathe at the doctor's advice. Think of this as a prescription for treating a disease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old man like a carrion." The young man whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bath is a degenerate act. It will drain energy from the pores." Old-fashioned old people can't understand the popularity of morning baths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So using strong perfume to cover up the dirty smell will not make others suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The puppet teacher helped the old baron, the closer it was. His ability is stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am free to declare that Paris Dahlmark is my legal heir." Immediately, he will dominate the body and announce it to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final trial begins in the bright bells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran, who appeared on the bench, surprised Heber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Karl Tiven? This shards deceived me and cast it on the side of the royal family." The viscount glared at Fran, "if it was in the second instance, I am still afraid that you will tell the secret, but now, even if Saint Mutu is reincarnation, it cannot reverse the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peji immediately got a report from his subordinates, out of Avoiding suspicion, she did not go to the hall in a bright and bright way, and at any time someone told her about everything that happened in the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment she bit her lip and wondering what is going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one will be stupid to take over the case at this time to influence his future, unless he is confident to help the royal family win the lawsuit?" Peggy smiled. Laugh, "If you really have this ability. Then I want to get you more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least in the eyes of Missy, extraordinary wisdom is more important than the ten golden veins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, the situation was very unfavorable to Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old baron, as soon as he went to court, announced that he had regarded Martida as his blood relative and had legal inheritance rights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The prosecutor, I think it is over." The judge suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a small detail caught the attention of Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true Paris has said that even her mother does not know whether the child is the flesh of the old baron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the old baron, to a certain extent, also drives the mother and daughter away for this reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous "I really don't like this child, but the family business, not passed on to my own descendants, is it confiscation to enter the national treasury?" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not hesitate to hand over the inheritance to a person who is only 50% likely to be a descendant of his own generation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't say that this is a miser who has a terrible life for his own son. Even ordinary people will not be so sloppy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan thought about two possibilities: being coerced by the nephew, or his spirit was abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Tutai also thought of the former, but was denied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of mental abnormality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon is still very strange to Fran. So he did not expect the old baron to be a dead body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your, according to the terms of the law, it must be proved whether the person has the conditions for giving evidence. We all know that the old baron has just recovered from a serious illness, and it is inevitable..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have four doctors' certificates, including Thorpe, the most famous surgeon in São Paulo, who has performed surgery for several officials, is it a prosecutor? Want to deny Mr. Thorpe's expertise?" The lawyer immediately protested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am also respectful of Mr. Thorpe’s professional ethics, but I suspect that the old baron will be affected by the illness and the brain will be A regretful thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brain? That is the field given by God, what method do you have to verify?" The judge was very suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The puppeteer manipulated the old baron and screamed in a hoarse voice, "Do you actually say that I am a mental patient? I will certainly complain to the aristocratic court and actually have a prosecution." The official insulted the party in court!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very angry, but his face does not show any expression." Fran said, " Rheumatism can cause facial paralysis and also affect the brain. Any doctor will agree with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formerly, the wild cat's condition, let blessing Lan has done some research on rheumatism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medical profession, there are hundreds of disease files that can agree with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not a doctor, and the words you say won't get legal support." The lawyer retorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, the prosecutor has the right to raise any doubts, and the lawyer must answer. We can temporarily adjourn the court and wait for the emperor's doctor to check again." Lan proposed that the thing he lacks most is time. "Either we wait a few days; or, let me do a small test now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puppet teacher Sorry nodded, he couldn't let a dead person have a look of joy and sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procrastination tactics? Damn, in a few days, your body will rot. Viscount Heber signaled that the lawyer should not be fooled and agreed to be tested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small prosecutor who is not a professional doctor, in this respect, there are not many tricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, you must end this lawsuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecution lacks time to reorganize the case, and the Viscount and the gorse, also in the early summer when the temperature is getting higher, allows the body to be preserved A longer way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge said to Fran, "You are not a doctor, unless the results can make everyone convinced, otherwise, it will not be used as evidence."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, I said, a little side test." Fran thanked the judge and walked to the old baron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood and looked down at the old man who was aging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inexplicable feeling suddenly appeared again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart was squeezed uncomfortable, and the ears seemed to be knocking on the bell of the bell tower, screaming. The energy of the sacred object flows uncontrollably in the body, looking for a passage for venting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran strangely gasped a few breaths, held his mind and began to ask questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
