			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Wednesday, October 3, at 7 pm, in the city of Tyrolean south of the bay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the Dalmac mansion, the housekeeper Tani, who is wearing a yellow uniform, is complaining about the sweltering ghost weather, so that his vest is soaked, but whether it is Out of etiquette, or the owner's extremely picky taste, Tani can not take off the tight dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Wednesday of the beginning of the month, the female baron Parish Dalmark will hold a grand ball in the mansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mansion is arranged to have a festive and festive taste. The sea of ​​seafood from all over the country is full of tables, the kitchen is working, and the servants are coming in and out. Keep delicious grilled meat, grouse and squid on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Tirol, a medium-sized city at the junction of the South and the Gulf, the Baroness is the most iconic figure in the social world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to imagine that there will be women who are so addicted to socializing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A successful ball, the owner must take at least 3,000 Caesars to hire famous singers, delicious food from all over the country, and skilled chefs. Sometimes, fashion designers and models who are currently popular are invited to hold a salon-style new product launch in the middle of the banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of businessmen, banquets are a shortcut to good business. In the hearts of politicians, they are close to friendship and privately reach an alliance, but the baron There is neither the idea of ​​doing business nor the thought of gaining political benefits. She is purely for the limelight and lavishly throwing a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you know the history of Paris, you can't help but wonder how much the gorse promised her. Someone who has secretly counted the account, this step-by-step young lady, last month, just procured jewelry and clothing, it took 40,000 Caesar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Tani, the ice in the underground storage room is not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry up Going to a nearby hotel, regardless of the price, Darmack can't let guests drink red wine without ice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housekeeper must not only receive an endless stream of visitors, but also deal with various emergencies. I am too busy to pay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he saw a middle-aged man in a black box and walked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequent attendance of the ball, the housekeeper can remember, but this man is very strange to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tani greeted him with a smile, "Sir, your post."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Hey, is the banquet? I am sorry, I am the Dall Law Lonchi of the Department of Justice in Tantin.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask Miss Baron some things."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it urgent?" The housekeeper looked very embarrassed. "I asked if the owner would meet you, I can't be the master."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris is standing on the balcony on the second floor. This girl, who is just seventeen years old, is no longer young, her chest and hips are as mature as women, and cosmetics are covered up. The skin that is not white enough to modify the too tall bones. Let her look a bit more beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monthly today. Her mansion will be the most lively place in the whole of Tyrol, with the mayor, parliamentarians, government bureaucrats, and prestigious locals packed with luxurious halls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only at this time can she feel. I am no longer the shabby gimmick who relied on the breath of others, but the real class of the real class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She kept holding banquets, constantly spending a lot of money, using this way to satisfy her distorted vanity and to bury her innermost feeling of inferiority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My sweetheart, can't you have a drink?" Lamy holding a glass of wine went into the balcony. This man is a man of the Lord's family in the city who does not have the right to inherit. The poorly-run lord's house can only give him two hundred baht per month, and he is still handsome, but his clothes are popular styles six months ago. Although the boots are waxed. There are still signs of damage at the edges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris and Lamy have been on the bed several times and often pay for him. She knows that this man is only for money. If one day, she goes bankrupt, and the man will abandon himself like a dog. But the girl couldn't help it. When Lamy piled up with a false smile and got a thousand pieces from her hand, Paris would produce a kind of ** that was stronger than **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I used to look up to the nobility. Now I am shaking my tail in front of me, waiting for me to throw out a few bones." She thought about it, she felt the following is not wet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe before the official dance, we can have fun." Lamy puts on the sexiest smile, whispering in her ear, slowly reaching out Under the clothes, stroke it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler’s voice interrupted the ** in the bedroom. “Master, there is a Mr. Longqi who came to the Justice Hall of Tantin and wants to meet you privately. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris got rid of the tongue that Lamy had just reached into his mouth. "Longchi? I haven't heard of this person. What is he doing?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to what I said, he is investigating a case and would like to ask you for a clue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The case?" Paris was confused, but the officials of the Justice Hall of Justice also asked her for help. This undoubtedly improved her status. "Well, please go to the hall, I will come right away." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl did not expect that this meeting was the beginning of a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the hall against the wall, there is a row of round sofas without armrests, many guests are sitting there, whispering, Paris Smiling and greeted them, please ask Zall Law to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What position do you hold in the Judiciary? Peggy cousin has a good relationship with me, and her colleagues, of course, will take good care of them." The girl shows off, though The real Missy only occasionally wrote a few short letters to her, but in Tyrol, all the big guys would look at her differently because of the name of the gorse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary female baron and the distant relatives of the Reinschmann family can be greatly different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am her secretary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too smart!" Parry Sis deliberately used other people to hear the voice shouting, "Please say hello to the Emperor of the Emperor on my behalf." Around the eyes of concern, let the girl feel comfortable in the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, it's all right." Zall's method took out his notebook. "Lord Baron, what is your origin?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Born? I am of course the heir to the Dahlmak family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to ask, what do you do before you inherit the title?" I never knew what was called euphemism. "I found your cousin has passed away, and the Western Court has not recorded your past. I would like to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;帕Lisi’s expression sank. The most intolerable thing she was was someone trying to dig into her past, a social star, a former part-time prostitute who was a ruined troupe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. She can't allow anyone to know about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I used to be a nurse in a clinic, and I have been a nun in the nursery. When people are lonely, aren’t they?" Parisis is cold. Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, in the famous dispute over inheritance rights in the Western Court, the prosecutor who defended you, of course, we all know. The identity is fake, that Who is the liar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl regrets why she will meet the catastrophe in a large audience. "Maybe the court has a loophole in the system. Who knows that he is Who.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A stranger who will help you and inherit a great legacy?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Listen to your tone, it seems to be interrogating me?" Paris couldn't stand it anymore, stood up. "I am very busy right now. What else do you have. Maybe another time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't dare to drive Zall Law out on the spot. This man is a subordinate of Peggy, but that arrogantly Missy. Not suddenly interested in your past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That will come back to you tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no extra free time this week. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I live in the city's flashing hotel, on specific days, I will wait for your notice." Zall Law regretfully took the notes, toward Going outside the door, "She is lying." The former secret police secretly pondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This woman is lying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita Whitemane sat on the sofa not far away and witnessed the whole process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructed by the head, she came directly to the city of Tyrol, and it was not difficult to get a ball at the ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Paris Darmack knows the head?" Lauvita thought, "Yes. As far as I know, the head and Kregan are fleeing from the west." To the Golden Horn Bay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought, "This man named Zall Law Lonchi is investigating privately, and there is no official force to intervene, so It’s too easy to let him disappear from the world. But at the moment, he is worth using.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautetta wants to know all the time, his beloved man What kind of person is there, what secrets he hides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love always makes the most savvy people stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She decided to secretly help Zolfa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris locked himself in the room with frustration, his teeth kept biting Holding nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not easy to get rid of the shadows of the past, but now, it is back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to close my mouth." The girl thought, "No, although the cheap cousin died in a fire, but some people know that noble Baroness Dalmark, a prostitute who had previously squatted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barry, Lauren, Nicole, yes, and the big man, Quasimodo, They won't keep a secret for me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris once saw from the newspaper that the Cardinals Theatre has developed, but she still looks down on her companions in the past. How to be famous is just a play. How can it be compared with the nobility? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her status and reputation cannot be shaken by these humble dramas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as they die, there will never be anyone who knows, my past." Paris’s nails were bitten with blood, but she didn’t feel it at all. Pain, there is some kind of fanatical light shining in my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
