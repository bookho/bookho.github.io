			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. The Dark Police Department and the Western Police Headquarters have set up heavy troops in all major roads to the Golden Bay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran also learned the name of Zall Law Lonchi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very impressed when he met Zall Law at the station. Especially the eyes and the tough face like steel cones, the secrets of such dark police halls are not easy to deal with, unless they are eliminated from the **, otherwise they will be like the bones of the bones, and they will be like the rotted beasts of the dying animals. , hold on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was fortunate to have a big punch in the van, otherwise his escape plan has failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he hesitated at the same time, like the gangster of Kregan, this is the person who wants to accept the law. And he who believes in the just saints is now in the same league. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shawei went out all day, and hasn't returned yet." Kregan put down half of the cow's bones and wiped the oil on his palms. He was a little uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the kid ran to find a girl." Xiaobis said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this level of Shawei knows the importance." Kregan knows the strengths and weaknesses of his cronies, and he sees Fran a little absent-minded, "Man Don't worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran said his name, "Toposo." Kregan knows that this is a pseudonym, but he did not ask, and inquiring about the past of others is a taboo on the Tao, so Daxie is always the name of "buddy" to "buddy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Browsing his eyes, Fran lets the vision of where he did not know where to fly again. He stood up and pushed open the window. The night wind was mixed with the summer heat that had not yet subsided. Come on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stayed in Haid for four days, procured the necessary field supplies, and had some information deployed by the authorities. In any case, Kregan has decided that the most Leave here late tomorrow night. Compared with the police, Daxie is more worried about the person who is in the underground world, and then revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe Corleone played with the dagger and applied a layer of pale blue poison to the black, dull blade. He rushed to the city this morning. Joe did not inform Igo boss about the manpower near Haide. He is used to performing tasks on his own, which is due to the nature of being an assassin master, but also to trust in his own ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Joe found out from the confession that it was not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"龙脉者?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Longmai, the head said so, my eyes He came to save the dead man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shavi said slyly, from the outside. He has no scars, only the hair is messy, his pupils are bloodshot, but the spirit has collapsed. Joe had a good idea of ​​getting intelligence from the mouth of the tough guy. He was good at torture and called it an elegant art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe just performed a recording of the skin in front of Shawei. He made a hole in the rabbit, poured it into mercury, and then he was not afraid of it. Gangsters. Humming. Seeing how an animal struggles bitterly, it takes a red ** out of the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawei didn't have the courage to be the rabbit, so he honestly explained everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the history of the Dragon's vein. No one has ever been born." Joe stared at the eyes of the prey and wanted to find traces of lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand what the dragon is, but I said the goods are genuine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The evidence witnessed is more reliable than the 10,000 words." Joe walked lightly behind Shawei, and the pace was not proportional to the tall body. He used the dagger to cut the rope that tied Shawei to the chair. It seemed to be too big, dagger. While scratching the rope, he opened the small wound on the back of Javert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In recognition of your cooperation," he generously announced. "Now, you can go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gangster sat in the chair for a while, even when the Assassin Master left, he did not know, he Struggling straight up, the numb legs made him almost fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawei just wants to go back to the boss to report the news, Kregan fist power, may be able to deal with this mysterious assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it’s coming to a temporary stop, Shawei feels that the eyelids are getting heavier and heavier, and the back is not a small pain. Like the flames of the savannah, it makes him feel difficult to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed with anger, and refused to let the black blood flowing out of his nose flow into his mouth. He finally went to the door. He wanted to knock on the door. He couldn’t lift his arm, he couldn’t lift it, his legs were soft, and he tried it several times without success. The unconscious body completed the mission. Shawei fell on the door panel and then rolled down from the two-step step, causing a loud noise that alerted the people in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is poison." Kregan stopped Xiaobis from rubbing his face with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" Xiaobis screamed, "I am going to find a doctor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;巨拳大佬 iron clear face, looking at Fran, "Man, please, I know you have a way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran did not answer He has speculated that the Holy Power is limited, and perhaps he will return to the land of the Lord in the moment of use. If it is a loved one, he will not hesitate; if he is a good person who suffers from sin, he can pay unreservedly after hesitation, but for the criminals in the underground world...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What are you doing? Please beg you." Kregan looked at Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me a reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reason?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason to save him." Fran said, "The criminal, the prison or the hell is the home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Reason!" Kregan screamed wildly. "What the hell are you fucking, criminals? You are now a member of the criminals. Your avatar is now hanging in the gate. We fled together for ten days. I provided the route. I took your rookie to avoid the ashes. Sawyer also helped you. It wasn't him. We were all trapped in the house and couldn't get any supplies. Well, maybe it's used, we use each other, But at least, you owe me a feeling, now, you should have gone even after you have gone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe Corleone in the shadows In the middle, I saw a scene that made him feel uncomfortable, the prey that was corroded by poison, and under the power of the man, recovered consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of Dragonmaids, according to the value of ability, it is divided into three levels: King, Monarch, and Ride. His shadow summoning can only be regarded as a monarch, but since he has an obedient, cheap sister who has mastery of the king's ability, his position has been firm since then, and he even has the opportunity to sit on the side of the underground world round table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the resurrection ability of this man, even in the dragon of the king level, is also inferior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can have two kings, who can say "no" to him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe is the person who wants to be a big man, the top of the food chain, his ideas are no longer simply killers. And think about things from the perspective of the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get him." Joe screamed silently. "If you can't get it, kill him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This works 16k novel network exclusive text version of the first release, without permission can not be reproduced, excerpts, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the team was sullenly counting the purse, and the previous profits were killed in rent and food. No more work, the Cardinals Troupe has to face the crisis of bankruptcy, but the important actor Casimodo, has not returned, and the kind prosecutor. There is no more news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that Casimodo and the little Matida and the daughters and daughters will be fine." The head thought distressed, she sighed and began to pile up A large pile of luggage in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, a small suitcase caught her attention, and the box and clothes were packed in a bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Nicole, don't let things go, don't worry about hanging clothes." The head shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, don't swear, this is not mine, it must have been thrown in by our big writers." Nicole ran over and looked at the box. Wronged to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren is biting his pen and thinking about the next story. Hearing this, he said, "I don't have a box. You know, all my luggage, except for two pieces of changed clothes, only pen, ink and paper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is this?" Barrie was strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is shaking their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open 瞧瞧." Nicole took the suitcase and started to play with it, but the password lock on it was very strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me come. This damn thing broke my skirt!" Barry just found that two pieces of clothes in the bag were hung in the corner of the box, and she screamed to find the scissors, began to lock, password The lock still stays still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole’s eyes turned and ran to the back of the house. When she came back, she slammed the firewood with a big axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The password lock is indeed responsible for its own shackles before being smashed. Well, at least it is more reliable than some bureaucrats on the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a stack of banknotes in the box, and a golden plaque wrapped in a small bag, so that for a while, there is only a rush of breathing in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole began to screw up Lauren, whose pain proved that this is not a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should we not be involved in any terrorist plot?" Nicole played the imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." The head of the team was fascinated by the ripples in the autumn wind. "This is the grace of heaven. Oh, it may be the lure of the devil, but whether it is favor or temptation, I will have it. With this money, the Cardinals can immediately change from a small group to a hunger for everyone.
