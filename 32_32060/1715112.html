			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. "Have it been... my home?" Anmei Freire whispered, looking at the tattered building in front of the back alley. Eyes are confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Fran answered, he touched the sign of "this room for rent" standing in front of the door. "I don't know if your husband and wife are missing, the landlord." How many people have been subletted, the furnishings in it have probably changed, except for memories, there is nothing left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait at the door," said the girl. Walking inward, the excitement of the heart, let her unscrupulously twist the door handle that wrapped the iron when she opened the door lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a deep shadow in the house and a secluded moonlight coming in through the louver of the blinds. An Mei squinted around, old and rough, and the walls were big. The peeling of the powder peeled out, revealing the blackened wooden board, filled with a rotten smell. She climbed up the stairs along the narrow stairs. The steps were like cats with a mat on the soles of the feet, and they did not make any noise on the wooden pedals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short corridor, three rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stands in front of a hidden door, takes a deep breath, gently pushes it open, and meditates in her heart, "Bedroom?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really is a living room that has been vacated. There are large pieces of gray soil on the floor. There are several places where furniture should be placed. The dust is slightly thinner, leaving a square trace of the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home, is a dreamy word, family, is a warm word, lively kitchen, fragrant meals, love her and her loved ones "I have had such a simple and stable life?" An Mei, she can hardly imagine wearing a home service, holding a rag, and fighting the dust on the floor wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels funny and...worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei suddenly thought that if there was no murder by the new allies, there would be no turning point in that fate, and no talent was given by Joe Coleon. She may still be like the average woman in the world. She considers the expenses of the family every day, goes to the market to bargain, and may have to take care of the unreasonable children, and gradually grow old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment. The girl finally realized the truth of her heart. She has been deceiving herself. She said, “Stopping taking medicine will temporarily lose strength. It is very dangerous.” She has many ways to get rid of the sinister palm of the drug, such as finding a remote place. It takes only one month, maybe two months, to hide, and you can fully recover. This is not difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she is afraid of change, afraid that she will become a little woman who is boring and boring and will only deal with trivial matters. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; She would not dependent on a man, the family was tied ropes involuntarily ordinary and sink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is an assassin master who walks in the dark and makes all the gangster godfathers feel sorrowful. It is a dragon with unlimited potential. She is used to determining the life and death of her prey and falls in love with it. Bloody phantom, where she wants to go. No one can stop what you want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since she already has the power to control her own destiny. Why bother to go back? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of gender, regardless of age, probably everyone has a similar idea: not bound by anything. Freedom and self are alive as you like. But love, morality, affection, and all kinds of good things hold the wings of our thoughts and want to fly, annihilating the instinctive nature, let us choose to be secure and embrace ordinary happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for An Mei, those invisible reins are no longer there. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; so she sighed, no longer lingering glanced empty room, whisper whisper, "Sorry Otto Flier. I used to be a man, from the mouth of Mr. Knight, I know that you are a person worthy of love. We have a strong love flame between us, but I can’t remember it, even your name looks like that. Unfamiliar. I will revenge for you, grandma, and my experience. But I don't want to be entangled in the past." Her tone is calm, "My past life is completely different from my current life." The two experiences, even the secular emperors and the gods of heaven, cannot ask that one person denies the present because of the past. Maybe when I pick up memories and rekindle those cool emotions, I will cry and regret. Wake up in the cold night, why is there such a feeling of anger, but at least at this moment, I am very proud of myself. It was my choice to be with you before, and now I decided to abandon it and it is my choice."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dole Act's face hung nasty smile, eyes looking at the Otto cold Speranskia. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Otto felt hearts Thatcher law is barely pressed hate, each other's eyes a kind of attempt to dig out the flaws of the pile cunning, reminded him of wilderness Hungry wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ignored it, smoking a cigarette, and there was a pile of burnt cigarette butts at his feet. From time to time, he looked at the house that had dreams and happiness in the past. The past with An Mei was a memorable memory. He wanted to re-own, no longer. lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the words you portrayed in An Mei, I feel that she is a good girl, once was." The quirky old man suddenly said, "Unimaginable, one Depending on human life and the law as a killer of nothing, it was once a weak and kind woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran did not expect that Zall was suddenly talking to himself about this topic, he Wrinkled eyebrows, I feel that there is a nameless fire, this is a private matter between him and his wife, why let an outsider dictate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pretends to be nothing, "This is the unfairness of fate, she will always find the right way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hah, your eager performance is like her husband, not a friend." Zallfa snarled, the idea of ​​genius was also limited by common sense, so that he did not realize that he was casual The words are completely in line with the facts, "I am constantly analyzing you, from your planning and acting style, you are deeply human, and like to start from the fallen character of humanity, but the words just now seem naive."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Childish?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zor's law laughs without a smile, the voice is like only the vulture Hey, "When I was a policeman, I personally arrested hundreds of criminals who had been examined. Many of them were just honest people, but once they sinned and felt the sweetness of sin, they could not help themselves. After sinking into the prison, even after entering the prison, the possibility of committing another crime is quite high after serving the sentence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;"People are not incurable creatures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have seen a thief, just to steal the votes, you will rather be Knife killing? You have seen a serial killer, lucky to escape the guillotine, stayed in the cell for forty years, old and declining, after being released from prison, the madman seems to have forgotten the hard labor and the threat of death. With a hand that has begun to tremble, a child is killed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin, just like the lid of a ditch, once it is uncovered, the rotten smell is full The rest of the life.” Zall Law shouted. Fortunately, there are very few passers-by in this street. No one noticed these two strange men. “You are now looking forward to a dark assassin. Because I remembered the past. Can you change back to a good person with a noble and innocent character?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is an ancient visit to the East: Humanity is evil, you are its supporter." Fran's face was frosty, his fists were pinched, his nails smashed into the flesh. "I believe another word: human nature is good. People can't be forever No mistakes, those who are off track, lost, need help and guidance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds like a religious redemption, but these words are sloppy. Can only lie to stupid fools." Zall is tit for tat. Salvation? If there is redemption, why is there no one to save his mother? He is filled with a kind of gloom and fanaticism. "Even as an opponent. I also admit that you are a smart person who will use his brain. Do you really believe what you said in your mouth? Don't be kidding!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zol's law wants to expose the hypocrisy of the man in front of him, and wants to laugh at him in different forms, but he only hears like a low-pitched answer, which contains incomparable words. The sturdy force made his remaining ridicule, to the tip of his tongue, but stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are wrong, I believe." Fran said extremely slowly and categorically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Black King. In the sea prison in the eyes of Chu Jun, the gray-eyed girl thoughtfully walked back and forth on the brown-yellow carpet and looked up at the pattern spreading on the rosewood wall. She and the head agreed on several hidden communication channels. Let her know the progress of things and plans happening on land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just received a secret letter from the head, which explained the remaining steps. Fran described his alliance with the revenge duo, "...they It is a very beneficial support arm, and it is still in control. Because of the previous experience, we have a lot of friction and hatred with them, but it has not caused irreparable situation, so you have to appease Cecilia’s hoe. Collaborate with each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter also mentions the identity of An Mei, "Mr. Ann Corleone, formerly known as An Mei Fryer, is my wife. It is also one of the blood debts owed to me by the gorse family, my good friend Fran Fryer..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita angered the letter He threw it on the ground and trampled it with his boots. Her big eyes were full of tears, her chest was so depressed that she wanted to scream, but she was so happy to sing. The two contradictory emotions made the girl feel suffocated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is clear, the head is the prosecutor she once secretly loved, he is not dead, still alive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Fran’s rhetoric is more in line with common sense, there is no loophole, but he did not expect that Lauetta would start to love himself when he was in Feidu. He won't win the outsider, but he won't know Lautta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This beautiful stalker, who has followed him dozens of times in the past, hides his love in his heart and looks at his little family enviously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The old man? How can I, I don't remember, Mr. Flair has this friend of yours." Lauvita pouted sadly. "No wonder you are right." The devil looked at her eyes and said that her tone and look were not right. I imagined countless possibilities, but I didn’t expect that she was not the same. It was really his wife, and you, Fran Fryer, I The first love object, and the person who is now in love, is actually the same man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is happy, she has never been biased, but she is depressed and Uneasy, the head still concealed the past and tried to lie to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to get all of Fran, from body to soul, not a shell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s bonfire is like a dry straw with oil, burning, "damn woman, I don’t care if you are because of amnesia or something, since you let go I shouldn't take it back again, he is mine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luovita looks like a lioness protecting the territory, strong eroticism and hatred Let her lose her reason, she can't imagine that her lover is about to leave, she can't allow it, and in the heart of her lover, she still lives other women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"锵..." A loud bang, the glass of the living room was thrown out of the table lamp, and Lauvita felt his love, just like This fragile glass is not guaranteed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Laughetta sister, what happened?" Cecilia at the tip of her ear yelled across the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Lori’s voice calmed the girl down. She sat on the bed and gasped and replied, “I accidentally broke the window, oh, don’t Worried, go back to the room to sleep, the recent naval search is very frequent, you need your ability to cover up the trail during the day, to raise the spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
