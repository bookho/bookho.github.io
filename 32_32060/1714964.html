			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Idle, it’s boring." Nicole slammed her head out of the iron bar of the carriage, feeling that she was comfortable with the wind of the sun. ,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the third day after leaving Dawn Fort. The more you go west, the rarer the smoke is, and the surrounding areas are all looking at the horizon, and you have to follow the road again. It took four days to reach the edge of the prosperous zone west of Byron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sevea, São Paulo... There are many places in the west that can make a fortune." The head of the team is full of confidence, "previously at Dawn Fort The circus is a pity, and if we can merge, our people will be full."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't you talk about the price?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, they have to split in half, we will pay more, if there are small scums, they will all buy instead of merging." Baru patted the cash box, which contained Full of change and bank deposit receipts, the eyes were shining with golden light, and I forgot all about it. Not long ago, the cardinals belonged to one of the lonely scorpions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, the car should also be replaced with a new one." Nicole interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal’s caravan was converted from a large trailer, wrapped in iron at the bottom of the trailer, with a pair of wheels in the middle, and the carriage was only half a person high. On the wooden board, a rectangular frame made of iron bars is welded, and the top of the frame is covered with canvas-made soft shed. When the weather is good, nothing happens, but the temperature is low, the wind is cold, and it stays in the car for a few minutes. It is enough to make people stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The caravan is too expensive, so I can say it later." Barry looked up at the small trailer at the rear of the car, and she had to check if the rope was secure at any time. The parts used in the tents of the drama group can be fully loaded on top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida yawned in the head of the head, and in a few days, she was not afraid of being born, and she was very familiar with several girls, even It is considered that the most annoying Paris, under the gift of a few candy, also abandoned resentment and has become a good friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world of children is really simple." Barrie lamented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world of adults is not that complicated." Nicole looked at the head and thought secretly. "On the road, why are you dressed so beautiful every day?" And from time to time to make up the makeup, to whom to see it." She squatted forward to drive the carriage of Fran, "the big man is very difficult to go back all day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Traveling people, it is common to miss a trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All roads through the city", this is a lot of sayings on the Byron road, but there is no guarantee that every road is so comfortable and wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road that the caravan entered now is in disrepair and is particularly damaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a half-day bump, the screaming voice made people worry that the car would fall apart in the next moment, everyone showed a painful expression, half of the caravan The space is full of sundries, and the other half is loaded with members. The five people are not afraid of the goods that have been broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big writer, don't press on me, you are dead, now it's not in a small tent." Nicole pushed Lauren, casual Talking about a cold, vulgar joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in the carriage, Lauren is still insisting on creation, he uses the box as a writing desk, and every time he bumps, the ink pen pulls a black line on the paper. When he finally gave up, the words on the piece of paper were distorted and no one knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren slouched and smiled at Nicole, sorry, just ready to talk, a burst of friction and something broke, from the bottom of the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the speed of driving was not fast, so did not let the car fall over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullan stayed in the horse, the caravan swayed and stopped at the side of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone jumped out of the car, and Barry did not forget to hold the money box for life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kind of old antiques should have been changed." Nicole complained, she just hurt her ass, sucking in the air and squatting, as if she was jumping Strange dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Spike up the raised stone, the shaft wheel broke." Lauren squatted on the floor, his hand slammed into the car, and after a while, Pick out two pieces of wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan took the axle and carefully identified the broken place for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris pushes him, "How are you in a daze?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Nothing?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t expect to find a vehicle repair line in the wilderness, “Where is the nearest residential area?” Fran asked the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barui thought carefully, "I haven’t been to the west for a long time, but looking at the distance, the nearest small village has a long way to go."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A total of six people, three horses, just went to the village." Fran said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do with the things in the car." Barry pampered the caravan. "Maybe we camp here, just send someone to the city to look for repairs." Workers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan vetoed her proposal, "Not safe at night, beware of wolves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The camping is troublesome, but it has not been done before. Just put on the fire, no beast dare to approach us." Barrie could not be separated from her family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can park the caravan in the nearby woods, cover it with weeds, carry valuable things, carry it with you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you really think so?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the car is broken, there is no horse, no one can get away, Other canvases and the like, even if they are lost, can be bought for a small amount of money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That...well."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren was surprised to see that the big star he wanted to win in the idea, one person dragged the whole caravan to the woods hundreds of meters away, "Hey, he is a myth "Hercules in the middle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get used to it," Nicole said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Covering the leaves of the forest with the dead branches of the forest, it is difficult to find when the passers-by passes, there is a caravan hidden in the trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's still a little unreliable, I will go back and add grass." Not far away, the head of Baru was crying and sulking, trying to turn the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand your mood, please listen to me." Fran said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to cause unnecessary panic, there is something he did not say, the break on the axle, there are traces of being cut by sharp weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before in the first court, he was slightly involved in the identification of evidence, wood that was simply broken by external force, there will not be a small smooth plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if there is no stone, the carriage can't go far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Dawn Fortress’s red fire show was stared at by the robbers? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not like, if it’s a robber, they should be on the first two nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone deliberately ruined and wanted to make the Cardinal Tour Troupe on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After rushing to the village before dark, it is safer to have more people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is slanting, and the sunset glows like the blood that is still rushing in the blood. The large clouds of fire make the sky seem to be burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people squeeze a horse, waiting to come to the small manor, people and horses are terribly tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very remote, not only the hotel, but also the signs of some shops. The unplanned houses make the roads between the villages mean, they are ordinary homes. On the chimney of every household, they are braving smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Caesar, let one of them, prepare a steaming meal, let out your own house, the dog raised by the head of the household is called to the stranger Not stopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., I will pull the dog away immediately." The head of the household kicked the dog, fearing that the golden Caesar flew away. "Don't call."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, you can leave the dog." Fran said. "Is there a woodwork here? We have a carriage to repair."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
