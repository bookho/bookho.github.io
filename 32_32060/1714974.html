Even a shallow trap can't be seen. It is okay to refuse directly. He can't use untenable evidence to force witnesses. "Check it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But refusal, it means equal recognition, I can't make the face of the family shame."<br /><br /> Hebrew argues that he believes in the ability of the lawyers team and wants to keep his reputation while also winning the lawsuit. "It is not over yet, we can agree to declare the doctor to go to court."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the testicle is no longer important..." Peggy felt sick for the word. "The prosecutor’s purpose has been achieved. Now, without detailed medical examination, the old man cannot. Then become a witness, but a zombie whose heart stops beating, want everyone to know that there is a living dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abandon, a few days later announced that the old baron passed away because of his temperament. At present you want The consideration is to pick a good coffin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heber is not reconciled, "Abandonment is one of the best golden veins in the West."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, then you can continue, the gorse is not accompanied." Peggy said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Although Leinschmann is said to be the head of the nobility, it does not mean that you can do whatever you want. Advise me to fight against the emperor and give up. I am also yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy looked at him with a funny smile, "Threaten? Hey, I really want to see, as a Viscount, and challenge the royal family and Dagong’s brave. Do you want to play a game? It’s a man who spends a month. If you can keep your current status after 30 days, let’s sit down and talk.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount gasped, grievously bowed his head, "How dare..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chess piece is the chess piece, it is useless. Throw it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alliance broke down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Heber was full of grievances. "Tomorrow, the chick that the prosecutor found was officially entitled to inheritance. Ha, the girl in the country, I have seen it again." In what world, I always have a way to control it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Peggy is thinking, "A woman without a background can still keep her status, she needs A backing, the gorse is a good choice for her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have their own ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Followers come in. Respectfully, "I just invited Mr. Carl Tiewen, but he is ill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get the best doctors in the city, and Assigning a man to investigate his background, I always think of him..." Missy thought about it and didn't go on. The style of this person in court is very similar to the way she handles a disobedient person in her memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun sets, the afterglow of the setting sun has not faded. A few rays of light spread into the clean room of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrap the carpet, table and chair, and the girl in the orange of the brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The human heart is like the glory of the setting sun. It seems to be brilliant, but the temperature is getting colder." She thought, she suddenly felt a little lonely. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Prepare the carriage, I don't want to be with the monkey again under the roof." Peggy ordered, "Find another hotel."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount did not come to see him off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gorse’s carriage just opened a street and stopped. A girl stretched her arm and blocked the car on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Dalmak Paris, requesting to be your master." She shouted at the guard who was in the alert position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy put his head out of the window. Looking at her strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris wore a plain long dress, wrapped her hair in a towel, and hurriedly lifted the skirts to the side of the skirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I secretly followed the carriage of Heber's cousin to find it here," she stammered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, please come up and sit down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking across from yourself, it looks slightly Uneasy Paris, Peggy said, "First of all, congratulations, there is a good prosecutor. A woman will soon be born in the west."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I am very grateful to Mr. Tiewen. However, I am not worthy of my current status.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What do you say?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, I am a weak woman who knows nothing. I have never had the experience of governing the territory.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The helper and knight in the manor I don't know one. And I believe that in the west, there are many families who are looking for cheaper from me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your warm heart Brother may help." Peggy speaks with puns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Missing lady, this is where I am most worried, maybe he is too enthusiastic." Paris obviously has his own plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk about your thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If, the Grand Duke will accept me as a foster daughter Then, as a daughter, the generals are handed over to the father’s guardianship, which is normal.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Interesting thoughts, is Mr. Tievin handing you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He doesn't know, and he can't stop me from doing this." Paris raised her head, and the scorpion shone with the familiar light of Peggy, the ambitious The little man is eager to gain a position and firmly look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The prostitute is a good name, and the distant relatives of the gorse are quite numerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then, I need the title of the count, the Countess of Reinschmann Donparis, it sounds very comfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too greedy, Baron. And The family name cannot be given to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That must ensure my annual income and salaries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Complete." Peggy took her hand, took the necklace from the jewelry box in the closet of the compartment, and put it on the neck of Paris. "You should dress up pretty, cousin."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris smiled and smacked the big diamond adorned at the bottom of the chain. "This is the first, sooner or later, all the jewellery and gorgeous clothes will be Belong to me." She thought with joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful transactions, real tickets and high society life, far more than in the western mining, take care of boring affairs, cope with others The black hand of the world must be more free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Cardinals, Paulis has long been left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, there is also a ugly big daughter, called Madida’s idiot, who has spent a lot of time on the way to please. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t at Dawn Fortress, she saw a few knights wearing walnut badges, thinking that the old baron was sent to deal with the family scandal’s killer. Looking for a substitute, send a shawl worth a few dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that she is definitely not the flesh of the old baron. When I was living with my mother, there was a frequent visitor to the hawker, and Paris remembered it. Every time she looks in the mirror, she can find the characteristics of the frequent visitor from the face and from the cheekbones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the turn of the peak, actually came to her to inherit the family business. God knows that when she is no one, she regrets to grab a blood mark from her arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, luck belongs to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of the annuity and the female baron, from this moment, she is no longer in the tour troupe, accompanied by a smile to serve the starring role with the customer. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally got rid of the hateful underclass and life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy looked at the happy "cousin" and chose a few outlets for her in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be obedient, take a pen to raise money; if you want to come up with a small rebellious little personality, then the puppeteer in the underground world can come in handy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscounts will vent their anger on Mathida. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whip pulled out the road in the girl, the blood beads like a little flower, dripping from the crack of the skin, she cried, but did not cause The mercy of the perpetrator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad, save me!" Matilda's little face twisted into pain in a painful manner. She held her head with her hand and cried weakly to Heber. "Don't call, Dad and good friends will teach you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let your dad and good friends come out." Heber laughed, The sick red blush was covered with cheeks, and the whip made the skirt on the girl a flying rag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white skin that is exposed to the outside, the scars are more red. Heber looked at the mature girl, swallowed, and suddenly came. "Maybe I can be gentle." He licked his dry lips and reached for the clothes left by the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden pale flames, shaking everything in the room, countless shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the severe pain, before the Viscount’s body melted, he only heard the girl crying and said, “I said, I have a very good friend. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the interior returned to calm, echoing Ma Dida crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl slowly wiped her tears, she looked around timidly, and looked at the half-window window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found out old clothes from the cupboard, climbed up the window, and jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The branches and leaves of the shrubs swayed, and the guards of the hotel were surrounded by vigilance. Matilda looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
