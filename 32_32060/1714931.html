			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil, you deceitful devil." When the gangster was sentenced to life imprisonment, he desperately yelled at Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, dear sir, wait for me in hell, maybe I will visit you after 60 years." Fran cleaned up the paperwork, and he was casual. Responding, he did not want to celebrate his victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few nights, four times can make him backache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Cavaliers stumble over a group of opponents in the arena, the supporters will ask him to have the same performance in the next competition; if the merchant sells a discount someday The goods, the customer will complain that the original price of the goods is expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, if a man has been in bed four times, then when he can only deal with three times, it will lead to lover’s contempt and pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Fran, the hot gift of the little wild cat is getting harder and harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has left a shadow on men’s self-esteem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whimsical words caused the applause of the audience, the undefeated law representatives, young, handsome, single, all of which made Fran’s popularity index rise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first court, Fran was getting more and more attention, and people were surprised to find that he also won the friendship of the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Master can always be a cold face of a deputy, when everyone sees him amiablely greeting a small court clerk, everyone is thinking The meaning of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this newcomer named Fran, the relative of the master? Or, because of talent, being seen as a magic apprentice? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which point, when a person stands behind a magician, it represents his future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Fran knows these guesses, it is estimated that he will smile in his heart. Mr. William once tested his talent when he was bored, and then he said unceremoniously. "Your fit to the arcane is no different from the stone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the rumors spread to An Mei’s ears, the little wild cat once asked Cuidong West with curiosity. Fran, who was entangled in no way, had to use his mouth and tongue to block the chattering words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between him and the magician is purely human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, a magician owes you a favor, always better than you owe a magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanity is a race that easily forgets suffering. In less than half a month, the fear of continuous murders has gradually become a time on the table. Interestingly, people guessed the identity of the murderer while ridiculing the patrol team's ability to solve crimes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The magician is not a police dog. I can't expect me to smell the whereabouts of the murderer with my nose." William dropped the sentence after working hard for a few days. And went back to the world of magic and alchemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the midnight butcher seems to have evaporated from the human world and did not shoot again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is quiet again, and the public’s fearful and uneasy look can no longer be seen, except for the patrol team inspected by a few white hairs. Others are very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-month probationary period is coming to an end, and Fran is holding his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Grand Prosecutor Camilo appreciated him very much and said that he would support him to stay in the first court, Fran carefully expressed his gratitude for this commitment. I hope everything comes by the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you should be the most impartial court, but also pay attention to human relations, then what can be trusted in this world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best prosecutor who can become the first court is the best, it is not good, go to the district court, maybe bitter, privately find a few part-time jobs, make the salary Enough to rent a large room with a small balcony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan once entrusted a real estate agent to inquire about it. In his spare time, he also inspected several houses recommended by merchants, old houses of nobles, and empty units of emerging apartments. Very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Day, it’s not like the old house of more than forty years of history, the maintenance is perfect, I love the piece of rose after ting."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s not bad here. Although it’s an apartment building, it’s so beautiful to see the streetscape outside the window from a height.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little wild cat accompanying him, every When I got there, I was so excited that Fran saw the star of her dream from her beautiful big eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really want to move in early, my grandmother has not enjoyed such a big bedroom." After saying goodbye to the real estate merchants, An Mei sighed unfinished Then, holding Fran, standing outside the house, fascinated and watched the big house in the dream until dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happiness always makes everything very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, at the last minute, Fran is cautious and wants to avoid unfavorable troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source of trouble is the big lady of the gorse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this young lady has a special preference for smart people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few times, Peggy will invite him to dinner. The dining venue is often the most famous hotel on Baodang Street. From the quality of the waiter, the light can be estimated to be absolutely deserved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every waiter can skillfully say which vintage wine tastes and what food is suitable for; what kind of drink is on the right side of the mouth Try it a bit, or try a little more on the left side of the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for the foreman, he is also proficient in several foreign languages ​​and is an elegant gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with them, Fran seems to feel that his taste and knowledge are inferior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So every time I order, Fran is silent, watching Peggy seriously consider drinking three or four years of wine, the choice of goat cheese or Blue cheese. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This girl is pursuing perfection, perfection and tediousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first glance, Peggy seems to be an arrogant lady. She treats the people around her with disdain and keeps a long distance away from everyone. But Fran felt that it was just an illusion. He realized that the girl was very lonely inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes Fran would persuade her to be more friendly to her peers, but the girl said with a disgusted expression, "Can't be good enough, live a ignorant life, what is the difference between such a person and a monkey? Why should I treat the monkey kindly?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran was abandoned by the girl’s poison tongue for a few times and gave up her efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lady who is aristocratic in the family knows how to be human, but it is not his duty, and the gossip in the court is more, the shackles between a lower aristocrat and a great lady. Mei, spread quickly in the first court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran began to avoid having too much contact with Peggy, this is the basic principle for the survival of newcomers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this lady seems to have a strong interest in Fran, she sees Fran as a friend who is worthy of his first court, and their dinner is intermittent. In progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How about this sheep eye? Deliberately made." Peggy asked, "It looks disgusting, but it tastes good. I like it very much." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day knows how Fran has swallowed a round eyeball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The taste...well, the taste is wonderful, pretty good." Out of courtesy, Fran said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this, at the dinner party, Peggy always entertained him with the eyes of the sheep that he felt "very good." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a smart person, I like smart people, or the Reinschmann family likes smart people." After several dinners, Peggy suddenly said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I’ve won the prize."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran answered cautiously, he knows Missy’s words In the intention of recruiting, the Reinschmann family has always regarded talent as the foundation for the prosperity of the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy shook his wrist, standing in the salon, the waiter rushed to the silver kettle, and re-stored the brown-red honey tea for the empty cup, girl Satisfied with the ground, and then said, "Power, wealth, lust, will always make the reality seem helpless. You are very talented, but when you are full of white hair, but also for the livelihood, continue to look at what should belong to you, but When you are occupied by monkeys, remorse will completely collapse you. And Reinschmann will make this remorse no longer exist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking out of the luxury hotel on Baodeng Street, the carriage that carved the gorse in the inconspicuous place was parked at the door. The passing pedestrians looked at the two horses pulling the car with appreciation. The goods may be secretly surprised. Although it is not a purebred horse, it is at least a descendant of the purebred horses. It is a luxury act to pull them with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please consider, Leinschmann never disappoints loyal people." When the carriage started, Peggy put his head out of the carriage and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night tonight is very gloomy, the dark clouds at dusk have been covering the moon, Fran is standing by the street, ready to find a free carriage to go home, but one After the meeting, he decided to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people feel that frowning, holding their chin, sitting and thinking, is really full of wisdom, so in the singing of the poet, often Hearing such poems, "The king of Tyre quietly sat quietly, his eyes crossed the farthest clouds, and the wild thoughts struggled in his mind, the power of collapse, the crown of his eyes, he was about to have nothing. Sunrise to sunset, The body of the king's solidified body finally trembled slightly. He left the throne and told the entourage to go on the snowy night and go to the sacred Anno for forgiveness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But real thinking At the same time, the static movement will make your brain produce a similarly tight blockage. We have reason to believe that the king who was naked in the record and stayed in front of the Pope's Hall for three days and nights, and finally won the coronation, will frantically break everything at hand before making a painful choice, but sighs with helplessness. Walk back and forth in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran does not know how many streets have passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young prosecutors all dream that they will one day become a big man, but become a vassal of a family, replacing justice and freedom in the interests of the family, and Not his pursuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puppets that are beautifully wrapped in gold foil, even if they play the emperor on the stage, can't get rid of the fate of being manipulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Respond to a euphemistic reason." Fran decided, then at the corner, he stopped, the puffs and chocolates in the shop window were Exudes a lust of appetite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buy a few pieces for An Mei, she loves dessert." Counting the change in the wallet, Fran went into the pastry room, full of sweets The smell immediately surrounded him, and the unfilled stomach began to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a hotel where rituals are crappy, facing the eyes of the sheep, it is not easy to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The craftsmanship of the hoe is good, just use the cake to match." With a small box in the pastry room, Fran happily thought, the pace was more brisk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;饕餮, greed, laziness, lust, arrogance, jealousy, human beings always There are all kinds of endless yu hopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a bug on delicate flowers, a wildfire that burns everything, after vandalism, leaving only the missing petals, and the black, hopeless wasteland . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, with the law, there are courts and judges, because human beings are also afraid of being swallowed up by their own arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the human world, the law binds the behavior of the majority, and fairly fairs the society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the king’s will must be restricted by the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Holy See is an exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The secular law cannot affect the people of God." From the pope to the most inferior priests, they can honestly think that they can judge them. Only religious courts and heretical trials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Holy See is limited to the inside, it is of course great joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But obviously, the Holy See has affected and hampered the rule of law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most famous is the right to asylum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every monastery and cathedral, a wooden cross is hung on the threshold of the back door, which is a sign of the safety of the fugitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any non-infidel, even a sinister wantedman, just touches the cross on the door, shouts, "Requests asylum", and then puts all of himself The property is dedicated to the seal of light, and it will be protected from inviolability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dares to go to the monastery to arrest. "The church is a heavenly kingdom, and the gods live here." The Holy See must not allow trampling on theocracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, asylum-seekers can only live in monasteries in this life, and when they leave the gate, they claim that the right to asylum has lapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although from then on, it is necessary to live a life of a monk, but those who have nowhere to go will still choose this path at the last minute. Living, can continue to feel the sunrise and sunset, it is better than to kiss the guillotine forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Norson-Philippe Knight is the person who made this choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first court case, Northen was a cruel and greedy adventurer. The spirit of the nobility and the knight was obviously a joke for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once organized a private squad to harass and plunder the enemy caravans. In the eyes of the Byrons, he was a hero. At the reception, the scars of Northen’s body often attracted the excitement of the ladies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until one day, a private squad member who owes a loan shark to gambling, forced to sell a gold button with four black erect lions. The hero became a wanted prisoner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four black erect lions, the home of the Earl of Hothouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that gold button, should belong to a young member of the Earl's family. This member, when he was traveling with him from a few years ago, lost his face with the gold coins he carried with him, and never appeared in front of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the seller’s confession, the count’s little nephew is lying quietly in a piece of unknown woods three feet deep underground?? A back of the head is opened flowers Of course, people will stay there quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who directs this crime is the Knights of Northren. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrol and the county family’s angry private guards have not yet set off, and the savvy knights have taken a few boxes of treasures into the cathedral of Fedo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money made the church bishop smile, and he sacredly declared that the Seal of Light sheltered the sinner, and he would repent of his sins in the church for the rest of his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the anger of the count can not incite theocracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murderer then spent twenty years in the church safely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murderer’s testimony is crucial to Fran’s case at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran believes that one of the suspects he is about to accuse is a member of the Northren squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to find a way to get him out." Fran closed the case file and frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next afternoon, the patrol hall, investigator Lyme received a private secretary announcement of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first court assistant prosecutor, Mr. Flair, would like to meet with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please come in, but know in advance, because the business is busy, you can only give this gentleman a quarter of an hour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyme does not like to deal with the prosecutor The bureaucrats who never stood at the forefront always complained a lot. "Hey, I am going to court, the accomplices of the suspects have not been found yet." They always said in an understatement, if they caught it, they would say, "Hey, the prisoner is in your hands, dig more from your mouth." It’s not difficult to point out the evidence.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attitude of not being compassionate is very annoying to the patrol officers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now even the apprentice of the assistant prosecutor is also coming to the door. Lyme impatiently drank his mouth and temporarily changed his decision. "Just give him only ten minutes." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten seconds later, Fran opened the door to Lyme's office. Inspector Lyme is about fifty years old, with a burly figure and a majestic expression. At first glance, he is a family of knights with a fine tradition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a real person." Fran thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the difference?" Lyme asked for a gesture of sitting down and asked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
