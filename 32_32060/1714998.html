			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. "The root fracture must be removed." After the doctor examined it, the metal clip and the probe were taken out of the mouth and placed in the disinfectant. He took off his gloves and wiped his sweat, as if he had been in the water, said, "I didn't bring an anesthetic, I have to go back and take it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Are you sweating?" The man looked at him and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, yes, it’s too hot." The dentist said vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the man is about to say, a little girl who is eight years old and with a twisted argument, carefully shows her head from the door. "Dad, isn’t it? Mom said that she should have dinner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I will come right away." The man sighed and gasped. He told the doctor, "Okay, fast. At the point, this damn tooth is terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dentist didn’t get mad as he walked to the apartment, he thought, "It’s that person. The crow is looking for a dangerous person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was helped by a crow because of an unfaithful incident, and now it is time for return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steaming meal did not bring a good mood to the man, he touched his shirt, and in the runaway, it was picked up. "And Wei Wener lost, maybe already dead. What is the shit king, the dragon has been raised for so long, a big use can not be sent." The man thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cursed the betrayal of the Coleone brothers and sisters in the bottom of his heart, and the gorse that stood by, but as long as he survived, he would have a chance to avenge sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Igo, eat it, it hurts, just drink salt water." Wang Hao looked at him distressedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman is his mistress, a stupid woman with an illegitimate daughter, who has no way to go, he spends money to raise, just one day when he is lonely, There is a place to stay. The people on the Tao will always leave behind for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, that agreement is still valid, no, can't believe him. Politically, there is no object of trust, and in the case of a big case before, he will also assist privately." However, in the current situation, he has no use value for him. The king of the word, the promise is no different from the skunk." He thought about various possibilities, and finally decided to follow the idea of ​​escape. Find a boat to go to Mamuk. Bringing money with you is enough to squander your life, so you don't have to take risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how long I thought, the man suddenly woke up, "What time is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every eight, dear, don't you really eat anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found out that something was wrong, the dentist left at six o'clock, and it took two hours to get back to the clinic to take anesthesia? And that suspicious sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about your daughter?" the man asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Send her back to sleep in the bedroom." Wang Yan smiled. "How long can you stay on this vacation?" She always thought that a man was a big shop. The principal. Run around the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preside over various trade matters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Responsibility, just now." The man whispered, putting his hand on Wang’s chest. Then, in the woman's cellar, slowly transferred to the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going in a hurry", Kregan flipped through the drawers The objects turned over to make the room even more wolf, and then took out a bag of jewellery and a few title deeds. "There is no value for even the money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Inspector, don't destroy the scene..." The police station stayed behind reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter." Fran said that he wore a gray coat and white gloves that the secret policeman used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You go to the apartment manager to ask for a statement. This case is the responsibility of our dark police department."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The confession has been answered, and there are detailed records." The police said, "You can go to the patrol hall for inspection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dark police hall can not count on ordinary The patrolman can find any valuable clues.” Fran said disdainfully, the tone is in line with the contradiction between the secret police and the public patrol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you insist, then okay." The agent stayed behind and suppressed the unhappiness and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the two dark police officers who appeared in front of themselves and claimed to take over the case. He has no good feelings. This is an apartment building. The sixth floor is high. The entire top floor unit belongs to this woman named Wang Wei, but it is doubtful that Wang Hao raises children and lives in a middle-class gathering place. But never have to go out to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four days ago, Wang Hao was found to be together with his daughter and died at home. The administrator was surprised because the wife on the top floor did not go downstairs for a day. She usually took her daughter to the park for a walk at dusk. As a result, in the case of knocking on the door, I turned to the balcony and saw the tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator walked into the room, he looked at the messy room, crossed the cross on his chest, murmured, "Mrs. Wang Hao is a good person, there are times I almost slept and was fired, that is, she helped me to say good things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Any special person visited before she died?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a man who has lived for half a month. The wife said that she is her husband. However, if there is not enough respect, everyone knows that Mrs. Wang should be a mistress. The man is her..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does a man look like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have only seen it once. When I came, it was a weirdo. I never went downstairs." The administrator recalled, "The middle-aged man, with a beautiful beard and a strong body."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret police exchanged their eyes with each other, "When did he leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The night before five days, must be that person To! If I knew earlier, certainly will not let him leave. "The administrator said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrolman stayed in the mouth and said, "The man is the most suspected. The patrol hall suspects that he has fled to the city of Tantin because he found a Tantin hotel in the bedroom. Reservation ticket."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tantin?" Kregan whispered to Fran, "Man, this is not easy, my power is currently only Limited to the Golden Bay area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, not Tantin. That is his intention to leave a messy sight." Fran just removed the sofa and checked Roll the thing on the carpet below, pick a coin from it and look carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
