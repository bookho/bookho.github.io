Strong patrol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While she was smashed into the detention room of the police station, the iron gate and the wall made a dull collision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the girl calmed down, and the detention room of the Liujin Street Police Station exuded a stench. Every room was closed with a gloomy suspect. Thieves, prostitutes, robbers who robbed the bakery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people in the same room with her, one is a drunken big fat man, all the ground is dirty vomit, not awake, lying On the wet concrete floor, snoring, the other is a woman with a messy hair, the lipstick on her lips is left with only a few bright traces, she leaned against the wall, smoking a cigarette, looking up and down New roommate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello." Lila nervously put up a smile, she felt that she should talk to the other party, "I am not a prisoner, this must be a misunderstanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone said this." The woman pouted and spit a cigarette ring. "What did you do?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...Oh, I think it’s because I beat a man, but it’s not my fault, it’s a despicable villain!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Hello, I also committed this matter, there was a messy night and refused to give money, so I bite off his nose." The woman laughed loudly, revealing the front teeth full of smog. Lila flinched back and sighed softly. "It’s just a slap in the face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The judge can't believe what you said, is the other party rich?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should have, at least more money than me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you are finished, just plug With a little money, in the court, there is no difference between a slap in the face and a slap in the face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilla Berry replied dumbly, "The law is fair. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dog's justice! The law is always a blind man, who gives more votes, and who is better with whom." The prostitute who bites someone's nose smashes Cigarettes, trampled with your ankles. "You enter the prison for the first time. You wait for the trial of the court, if you are lucky, pay a fine. If it is not good, go to the prison for a few months." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am done. The girl thought with frustration, her hands wrapped around her chest, but her body was still shaking. She hopes that this is just a nightmare and she opens her eyes. Everything that was unpleasant was gone, she was still carrying bags during the day, looking for news in the city, sitting at the table in the evening, biting the pen and thinking about how to write the manuscript. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are all good, your temper is stubborn, you don't want anything in your mind." Mom often said to her, "I went to work in a big city, this The problem can be changed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lila Berry is a beautiful town in the south. She was a tomboy since she was a child. Climb to the ostrich nest on the tree, catch the snake in the grass, and fight with the boys. The sun and the countryside in the countryside give her skin a healthy, light complexion that also gives her a strong energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this fake boy is already the most beautiful girl in the town at the age of 19, and his posture is still somewhat clear, but the slender legs and slender waist, Already have the taste of a mature woman. There were boys who had a private duel for her. In the middle of the night, the stupid boys sneaked into the house. Throwing pebbles into the window of her bedroom, I hope to get a response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her father is a rural teacher, the father’s education, so that she did not become stupid, only knows dating, and the boy’s flirtatious woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she is gradually not satisfied with a calm life, always eager to see the Metropolis. Have your own business, your own love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, Lila also quarreled with her mother. Her mother did not want her daughter to leave too far, nor did she think that women would be able to struggle for a big cause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the father convinced his mother. On the night when she left the town and was ready to go to the city of Tantin, the father said to her, "Good daughter, I have nothing to do with you, but you have to remember one sentence: be a person of integrity and kindness. No matter what. The excuse is that the fall is degenerate, and 10,000 sentences are justified. In the face of this fact, it is pale and powerless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you answer the question at that time? The girl two years ago, patted her chest confidently. "Dad, rest assured, your daughter, in the sun, always walks upside down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She was a restaurant waiter and sold tickets for tourist attractions. Until half a year ago, Lila finally found a decent job at a newspaper in Tanding. At first, it was only responsible for finishing the manuscripts, and the small clerk who served the tea for the editors. But she learned very quickly, news format, clues, interviews...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week ago, the opportunity finally came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The editor called her to the office and threw a stack of information. "You are responsible for this news. If the performance is good enough, the newspaper will consider promoting you as an official reporter. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Government Tunnel Project Shady" is the first press release she wrote based on the information provided by the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that day, Lila bought ten copies of the newspaper on her name, read it over and over again, then folded it and carefully locked it into the drawer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, there will be more, Lila Berry, will be the most famous big reporter in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her dreams, she seems to see that she can interview the highly respected archbishop, publish exclusive news for the most famous events, and even have a dream in the scene. Handsome princes, they screamed at a press conference, and then fell in love...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in reality, the happiness of twilight did not come, but the hardships did not To, an ugly profiteer has ruined everything about her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the content of the manuscript is too out of order, and the Cultural Affairs Bureau officially warned the Tantin Street newspaper that you have to bear all the responsibilities." Said, "It may be the revenge of the Lord of the Knights, I appreciate you, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leila is exhausted and tired in the corner, I don't know How long has it been, from the light in the police station, it is already dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next to the iron bars in the detention room, there was a thin brown bread and a potato soup that had been cooled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you eat? I haven't eaten yet." The roommate of the prostitute groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you eat, I am not hungry." Lila shook her head and asked embarrassedly. "Excuse me, where is the bathroom? I should call the police." Am I going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Washroom? Miss, are you at the hotel?" The roommate sipped the soup and pointed finger at the other side of the wall impatiently. "There is a drain hole, remember that the butt is aligned, and then flush it with a basin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lila couldn't believe to look at the simple "toilet", and he was stunned by the drunkard who was still asleep, feeling that he was going crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She desperately shook the iron bar and shouted, "I want a lawyer! I want to go out! I want a bathroom where no man is present!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, quiet." Soon a guard came over and knocked the iron bars on the railing with batons. "The lawyer and the freedom, waited in court and talked to the judge." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl desperately thought, "Here is hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night, as if a century Long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In half-sleeping, Lila seems to hear someone shouting his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was wrapped in a musty blanket in the detention room, looked up and saw a strange man standing outside the iron bar, he signaled the guard to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Miss Laila Berry?" The man has a fangs and a short stature. "Congratulations, I am the Carlo lawyer of the Justice Department. You are free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wiped her eyes in confusion. "Is it not going to court?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The plaintiff revoked the allegation, so there is no need to go through the judicial process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The profiteer is so kind? Lila thinks this is a conspiracy. She can't help but think of the case she saw in a mystery novel: a shameless villain character, in order to increase the crime of the protagonist, deliberately let him escape the prison, and then ambush the police outside, immediately The protagonist grabbed it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a possibility that the profiteer and the police station colluded. As long as she leaves the detention room for half a step, she will be detained for 20 years in the name of the crime of escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I will never leave." Lila said firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five minutes later, the same scene was repeated again and again, and the two patrolmen lifted the girl who was struggling to save the life and threw the police station. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind in the early morning, and the road surface of the **, made Lila feel embarrassed and unreal. She sat cross-legged on the ground, her hair tangled, cold and hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A carriage stopped in front of her, "Hello." A man's voice came out of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Casimodo Bo Knight!" The girl screamed from the ground and screamed, "What are you playing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please calm down." Fran walked down the carriage and handed Lila a piece of paper full of words. "You should look at it. From start to finish, you are being fooled and betrayed." The role."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl did not pay attention, tightened her face, and circumvented the carriage, she told herself in her heart, "Don’t ignore him, the liar will not tell the truth. He wants to frame me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a few steps, strong hunger and the accompanying vertigo, Lila lost balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, she seems to feel that she has fallen into someone’s arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let your dirty hands go, don't touch me." The girl whispered and refused, then lost consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, it’s time to send this lady to where." The coachman asked . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan flipped Lila’s wallet, a small navy wallet with dozens of change, and the key to the door in the house, “She lives in West City apartment, send her back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the clues investigated by Fran, this girl is just a cheap victim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspaper knew that the report that was full of embarrassment would attract dissatisfaction from the authorities, but they did not care about it in order to increase sales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, a freshman who did not know the dark side of the industry, under the guidance of the newspaper, became a writer for writing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being written warning from the Cultural Affairs Bureau, she was expelled to quell the dissatisfaction of the management department. The future of a newcomer, of course, is not as good as the profit from sales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
