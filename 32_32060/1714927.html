			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rookie prosecutor began to get attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s progress in the judiciary is beyond everyone’s expectations, there are rumors that at a lunch, Count Carmen, the first court of the First Aristocratic Court The grown-up, the most prominent figure in the judicial world, mentioned the name of Fran in an appreciative tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial court is like a bullring, a place where he competes with his opponents and fights. He likes to use a calm expression, a little humble tone, to let the interrogator relax his vigilance, and immediately he is fierce, pointing mercilessly to the other party's weaknesses, leaving the prey unprepared, and then being hit by the sword-like condemnation. , stumbled in the shadow of despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, when the accused appeared in people’s field of vision, everyone was surprised to take a breath of cold air, it was a sloppy face-faced, he was silly Sitting in the dock, the mouth continued to kneel down, dyed a large collar, the thin arms were always unconsciously horrified, the turbid eyeballs turned up, and the mouth was stunned by anyone who could not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the judge read out the accusation against him: fraud, many people issued a mocking snicker, a mentally handicapped, able to do this kind of activity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer also showed the doctor’s certificate, claiming that his client was a poor egg with no self-care ability, and said with pity, “a mind is unclear The disability, relying on the meager deposit interest, and a ridiculous businessman claimed to be deceived by his tricks. Hey, the world is upside down, and the people who made a fortune are not as good as a low energy!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burst of laughter in the court. Everyone looked at the plaintiff happily. It was a white fat man. He had a small tea shop in Feidu. He was struggling at the moment. Wiping the sweat on the wide forehead, he whispered, "He is pretending to be a buyer, and when he talks to me, he can be smart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp No one believes in fat words, even the judges show the expression of sympathy and accused, the ten merchants and nine traitors, probably this guy is trying to rob a mentally handicapped family, everyone thinks so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran asked the liar a few questions before, the liar confused and twisted his fingers, the butt moved in the chair, and then said that it was ridiculous. Reply. Even when Fran asked how sixteen plus twenty-four was equal, he tilted his eyes and thought for a long time, shaking his head hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer sighed at the side. "Look, if he has a minimum of logical ability, he won't suffer any wrong here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Fran said helplessly "Maybe the patrol should check the eyesight when selecting the team members."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrol knight who was present as a witness, stood up angrily and protested, then the observer Under the contempt of contempt, the red face hides in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people thought that the farce came to an end, Fran told the judge, "The case is very clear, we should freeze the defendant during the trial. The deposit was returned to him, um, I think, it’s two hundred gold coins.” Fran thought of something and turned to ask the lawyer, “Two hundred? This is not a small amount.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lawyer stunned, and he did not see the specific amount of deposits in the documents provided by the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still pleads with due diligence, "This is the legacy of his father, the god of light, if it were not for the money, he would have starved to the streets. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran nodded and seemed to agree with the lawyer's rhetoric, then he took out a piece of felt paper and dipped ink with a quill pen, quickly I wrote a few words and it seems that I signed my name on the verdict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the verdict is pronounced, it is more important to return the gold coins to the defendant to clarify the fairness of the court. Otherwise, everyone may privately doubt whether we will The bad businessman colluded and privately swallowed the property he lived on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a warm applause in the court, everyone was satisfied with this fair ruling, the fat businessman Muran The floor was on the stool, and he opened his mouth and couldn’t say anything. The judge also agreed with Fran’s move, and he signaled Fran to pass the verdict to himself. When the judge and the prosecutor simultaneously wrote the name, the arbitration would take effect on the spot. No doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, an anxious voice came, "It’s four hundred and sixty-two gold coins, got it wrong!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, all eyes were focused on the source of the sound, the defendant stood up, screaming loudly, and the original distorted face was straightened. Soon, he realized what the whole body had solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it’s four hundred and sixty-two." Fran turned sharply and strode to the liar and said with a sneer. "Before counting your gold coins, should we discuss it again, yours? IQ problem?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liar looked at the prosecutor desperately, he was unable to sit squatting, holding his head and hoarsely, "You...you are really A devil who plays with people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, just after the spring, the promotion notice reached the hands of Fran, who was preparing to leave work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, my great guy." The courtmaster was kind enough to look at the elders he grew up with. "You are the honor of the seventh court." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope to be your pride, just like you are my pride." Frankan said the elegant compliments of the nobles, trying to hide the joy . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the regulations, the District Court’s probation officer will serve as an assistant in the First Aristocratic Court for three months, and then he will be able to stand alone The role is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, when Fran’s salary was paid, he was able to rent a spacious apartment with a balcony in the new district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three months, just three months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take An Mei and her grandmother, and everyone lives happily together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scent of the fish soup floats again on the table, sharing the warmth in front of the fireplace with the beloved, and the feeling of being waiting to go home. It’s all so hopeful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe raise another dog? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the Seventh Street Court, the afterglow of the late winter has not completely subsided, and the tone of the air burst into a faint white mist in the air, which has been deposited in the heart. Excited like a forest bird that was stunned, it cheered loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," Fran screamed and couldn’t help but shook his fist with excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from the street, the cleaners who were busy cleaning up the scales and falling off the branches, looked at him inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening glow of the evening is trying to resist the night's harassment, shining with brilliant brilliance, the moon quietly revealing the outline from the clouds, and the dividing line of the night and the night is clearly displayed in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran feels that the reality is really good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring has indeed arrived, as if the night winds have become warmer, the stiff branches of the roadside trees are dotted with the green of the stars, and the pedestrians take off The bloated coat looks more spiritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The urban area of ​​Feidu is very lively, the garbage accumulated in the winter is cleaned a few days ago, the road is neat and tidy, and the shop is affixed with a beaming red in front of the window. Posters, merchants screamed hard, all kinds of long-lost rarities filled the counter, the tea that was just shipped in the spring, the three-fished squid that was salvaged from the deep sea, the colorful glassware, and the dazzling goods were fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the best sellers are still celebrations such as colored balls and funny masks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether poor or rich, everyone is waiting for a holiday in the new year: the arrival of the carnival. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of circus, stray poets, and troupe dance groups came together and carried a long line of troops entering the city in front of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enchanting dancers stretched their heads out of the window of the carriage, seductively blowing kisses toward the passing men, and the multicolored bells hanging from the raised white arms Crisp sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember to visit the goblin dance group, obediently, I will give you a place in the tent when I arrive." Wearing tights makes the plump figure undoubted The girls, flying with a wink, put a leaflet with a beautiful pattern and the name of the dance group into the man's arms, and by the way, teased Mo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circus intentionally pulled the canvas out of the beast cage, and the ferocious and strong beasts twirled back and forth in the cage, sullenly groaning toward the crowd. Curious people, especially children screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And independent stray poets, of course, are not so big, they are dressed in gorgeous costumes, walking calmly, only when they see a beautiful noble lady, Just stopped to play a few sounds, posing a melancholy expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feidu’s girl blushes behind her favorite poet and wants to know which hotel he lives in, and exchanges information about where the new man is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unscrupulous, crazy and happy continuous carnival for seven days, the most anticipated time of the Feidu people every year, is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for rogue streets and pubs with small rooms, carnival is not a good day, their business will be sluggish, and would rather be unlucky End early in the week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dancers who sell art don’t mind bringing the audience who can afford the price to their tent after the show, and the extra income is of course The more you have, the better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uniform of dance uniforms and the graceful form of long-term practice of singing and dancing, the natural temptation is much greater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when I saw a young girl with a thick face on the street, I could estimate the middle finger when I was indecent with the float of the tour troupe. Her identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fees are all on our site, and all the shreds should go to hell." Local rogue enemies cursed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fees are all on our site, and the chop should go to hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first nobility The court's chief prosecutor, Baron Camiro, slammed a thick stack of files on the table and screamed screamingly, the unrestrained big door made the glass ashtray on the table scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five lucky people who have just been recommended by the lower court, listened to the advice of the boss with a respectful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a luxurious office, the top six-story carved mahogany bookcases are filled with legal books, and the top layer of the grid must be placed on a low stool. If you search carefully, you can find even the precious first prints of famous works such as "The Source of Law" and "Theology and Law Research". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner who owns it is obviously not a imaginary wearing gold-rimmed glasses, a temperamental scholar, the big prosecutor’s body is bloated and short, and the white hair is like a Mediterranean. Forming a huge vortex, the baldness of the oily light is as bright as a mirror, and it speaks rudely like an uncultivated aunt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if he is scorned in court, he can suffer a big loss. As long as he is caught a little flawed, the prosecutor is like a mountain pig looking for food. He is squirting with enthusiasm, and he is brutally and carefully bitten until he Fully swallowed in the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can see who you are, hey, I have tried some trivial small cases in a small court, I thought I had mastered the sly, proud With a tail, I want to stay here for a while, then put on the official prosecutor's badge and return to the small court to continue playing unrealistic legal games."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Camiro took out the snuff box in his pocket, put a large dark brown tobacco on the nose and smelled it, then pointed to the file on the table and said, "The villain, the scum, all the chop in the world." They can all be found inside, they hide their evil deeds, and try to shake them out of the prison. Find out any clues and send them to hell. This is your mission for three months, and I used to take the laggards. Out of the props of the first court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the whispering of the thick Phnom Penh gate, Fran was relieved, he took the assigned file and looked at it. Peers and competitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is an elite who has been baptized in actual combat, especially the only girl. It is a girl who looks proud and has short hair like a man. A jacket that approximates men's clothing. From time to time, the eyebrows show arrogance, not particularly beautiful, but the intellectual streamer in her eyes calls her unique charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran noticed the long collar of her expensive pale yellow silk scarf, and did not have a small gorse brooch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get to know each other, I am Al Duna." The young man who showed his voice and manners is elegant, but the costumes have been Many ornaments made him look a little flashy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dunna Wen? This name is very familiar." Another prosecutor prosecutor said with some doubts, "Oh, the district court chief is also called Dunawen. This is a family that is well-known in the Judiciary of Feidu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, thank you for your compliment, he is my father." Ayr exaggeratedly "Of course, I urge you to believe that I am not here to benefit from the family, but my own ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecutors are amused by this modest words. And hold hands with each other friendly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the girl, hesitated, the hand with white silk gloves symbolically extended and immediately retracted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Peggy, first class student at the Royal College of Law." The girl proudly said, then raised her eyebrows with disdain. "I like victory, no matter Is it in the court for the prisoner, or a group of trainees to stand out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, beautiful lady, is this a declaration of war?" "Let the woman cry can hurt my reputation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peiji shrugged unconsciously, stretched out his thumb, pointed his finger down, and then said a word Leave without leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a funny girl, but the court is not suitable for women, and their inexplicable sensibility will always do things." Ayr continued with a smile, " Since everyone wants to help each other for three months, why not gather together to discuss the tasks, criminal law, commercial law, aristocratic law, whoever has the hand and the less familiar jurisdiction."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elton paused and looked at Fran. "As for this, everyone must know that the famous murder case that caused the first court prosecutor to have a headache is really a ruling." However, when someone assists you, it will make some things easier. Who knows the inside," he waved the file in his hand. "There will be something weird. One person's wisdom will not be better than the collective efforts of the elite." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only now, when we work hard for the prosecutor or the head of the court, our friendship will make the promotion path more convenient. The sentence is inappropriately described, even The sailor in the head, the single person and even the salary in his pocket can not be guaranteed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a eloquent, looking at the endless Aier, Fu Lan Xiang, and the meaning of alliance in his words, Fran is not surprised, any business has a small circle, it is better to have allies than to get enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two trainees from the second court agreed to nod, the rookie who had just been promoted from the local court, standing in the luxurious and magnificent trial hall It is inevitable that I will be eager to share the fear of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayre embraced them happily and then reached out to Fran. "Do you come together too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hesitated for a moment, Fran said, "In the art salon of the Rose Square, some paintings are worth thousands of gold, and the rich are often rushing to see if they get it, they seem to have more taste; while others still, although still Exquisite, but the price is only a few poor auspicious, why? Because the former is the cry of the true master soul, while the latter is the art workshop, please a few artisans, you paint the line, I paint, daily line "There are a lot of them produced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Art is not determined by the number of people." Fran said when he left, "In my eyes, the law is also the same. Door art."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the long corridor with a good brown carpet, in the vestibule, Fran met Peggy, she was sitting on the table in the fountain On the top, use your fingers to tease the ornamental fish in the pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colorful fishes that are close to the ocean are a rarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They who are fat and strong are not afraid of the proximity of human beings, follow the finger up and down, and want to find out whether the slender things are food. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally the fish jumped out of the water splashing on the water, splashing Peggy’s forehead, this is a serious girl, laughing and eating. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunshine slanting, looking from afar, the water surface is golden, and the golden spread to the girl, just like putting a layer of gorgeous Hyperthyroidism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan seems to think that only the dream scenes that exist in sonnets or oil paintings, out of the text, throw away the frame, lively, Vividly, it appears in reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe feel the eyes of Fran, Peggy condensed a smile, looking sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter returned to the girl’s face, she straightened up and walked vigorously to Fran, arrogantly said, “There are still smart people, I I thought that your four poor eggs would be like a fallen refugee, clinging to a group, and tempting the weak temperature to resist the cold of the night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no courage to face the challenge alone. Pinning your hopes on a weak alliance, such a person can't mean anything big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
