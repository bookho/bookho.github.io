			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the carnival, I have to go home. If you go to Tantin, you can come to me." Riddle handed Fran a voucher and used it. The ring carved from the whole piece of green spar is stained with ink, and the stamp of the gorse is covered with a quantity of "50". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am happy to have the opportunity to work for you later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ridel is back His comfortable carriage, carrying an authentic cigar, when he was alone, almost became a signature expression, a cynical look, replaced by the old city of Chengda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is aristocrats, businessmen, or jesters, there are always three people who want to approach him, trying to get a little benefit from the glory of the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he always gives generously hope and friendship to those people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone, at some point, will always come in handy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran bought a bowl of steaming pancake soup at the roadside stall, crispy pie with a delicious soup, tastes pretty good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed that the meat chops on the food stalls began to add orange peel, and the gadgets that were invented that year have been widely circulated. He didn't tell anyone about this formula. Some people who watched the observations might have guessed the trick to make the meat more delicious when they were purchased from the orange peel that was not part of the ingredients. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these orange peels have not been repeatedly baked, although they can remove the astringency, but make the meat somewhat sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Everyone is doing this, definitely not wrong." When Fran asked the stall owner, the cook replied, "Now everyone will It’s not a secret. Please believe that the orange peel is a bit more sour than the cockroach.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefit can make everyone crazy, Let them rack their brains and be savvy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they can also make them think that they are confused by their own off-track speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more intelligent people, the more so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inducing smart people to make wrong judgments, and burying traps for themselves is more effective than the ten sly plots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the beginning." Fran thought, he had to be more familiar with the gorse, to find the benefits that could make the family go crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deborah spent five days in ecstasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about asking the appraiser to identify the painting, but quickly dismissed the idea. "Before you get it, you can't leave any handles." He is veteran. Consider it. The painting can't take out the bank, how many eyes are staring at it, and he can't find an appraiser and bring it to the vault to announce the secrets he found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person knows, it is equal to how long it takes, the whole city will know that the president of the Double Eagle will use his brain again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deborah never believed that there were people in the world who were tight-lipped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is ready for 50,000 cash to meet all possibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first day after the carnival, Deborah came to the office early, and he even drank three cups of coffee, suppressing the urgency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the expiration date of the insurance deposit slip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 11 o'clock noon, the front desk informed him that Mr. Gry came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still the dress, but the sleeves are a bit dirty, just sitting down, the prodigal family began to complain, “The Father is on, the thieves in Feidu are so many, the day before yesterday, I The wallet was actually stolen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really good news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to be forced to wear old clothes, hey, I will never come back later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better, but you never come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray has issued an insurance receipt. "This painting is really the beginning of my bad luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deborah said, "Your, are you short of money now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hah, I will be short of money?" Glory sneered, but he stunned Eye sleeves, a little helplessly said, "If this is the bank of the Portuguese kingdom, I can extract two million by name, but there is no branch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Gloria is talking about the facts, the interest rates between the road and the countries, and the sometimes tense relationship, so that all banks are not willing to take the risk of opening a multinational business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A foreign rich, if you can't carry enough hard currency, then, out of national borders, he is a poor man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, I have a good idea to help you." The president said, "I have a friend who is an admirer of Dach, who frantically collects All the works of the master, maybe you can sell the paintings of the vault, have been urgently needed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need." Glead took out a ticket from the pocket. Count, Deborah has long been in the pile of money, he recognized at a glance, the money is about 3,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I borrowed from a friend, but unfortunately I was not familiar with it, but it was enough for me to return home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; On the outermost is a 50-piece gold roll, he is keenly aware that there is a stamp of Reinschmann on the gold roll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles like to play this trick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If his friend is a member of the family of Reinschmann, the identity of the gentleman is more credible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thousands of pieces?" Deborah screamed in amazement. "A gentleman like you, can you rent the most inferior carriage?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray's face is red, but still insists, "In accordance with tradition, things that bring mildew, in front of the house, have to be burned in the fire, I am prepared to do so "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One million, you fucking want to burn a million! The president is impulsive and wants to beat people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"15,000, please sell it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I bought 150,000 for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You already know a few days ago, it only worth 10,000."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I don't care, anyway, I have lost money, even if I earned back to 15,000, it doesn't help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loser does not waver . The president can only give in, "then, 50,000?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please give me the painting, the amount of tens of thousands is meaningless, I am ready to burn It makes the depressed mood better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president is almost a request, "You open a price."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, sir, I am very surprised." What did Glei discover? "A banker will take 50,000 to buy a product worth only 10,000? Is there any secret in the painting?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deborah had a pale face and his legs were shaking. "You are too imaginative." He sweated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I insist that the president of a bank will not make a sale of the loss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "To be honest, that friend is very important to my future." Deborah admire himself, and can think of a good speech at a critical juncture. "Draw in his eyes, compare with 200,000 bribes, give gifts. "It's good to vote for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a friend, your boss." Glehaha laughed, no doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please help me, you know, Dach’s paintings are rare in the market, and many times, you can’t buy them with money.” Deborah Rushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Gry said cheerfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to prepare for 50,000 yuan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You misunderstood, twenty Wan, I will sell it to you.” Gleed stared at him. “It’s worth more than 200,000 bribes. It’s good to give gifts.” He repeated the words of the governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deborah can't wait to slap a few slaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Either 200,000, or bring the painting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This head is full It is the son of cotton, and the extortion is first-class, but Deborah can't give up. His thinking has been filled with one million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The profit of 800,000 is not the same as that of 950,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suffocated, "I will give you a check?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Cash, return home After the check can not be cashed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president did not have so much cash, he bit his teeth and thought about it, nodded and said, "You wait."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going to transfer 150,000 from the bank’s account. He has this right, just fill in the money at the end of the month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the head office only looks at the full-month report, and privately plays a little trick, it will not mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, Gle carefully counted the banknotes and Kim Caesar, and satisfactorily handed over the insurance deposit slip to the president, "I wish you a smooth promotion." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deborah fell in the chair. After a long time, he was relieved, as if he had just experienced a life-and-death competition, even when he lost his family, do not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one million, he can start his own small office and no longer have to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, before that, I had to find a skilled craftsman to get Dach’s Helen from the sketch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have given you a chance." Fran thought, the sketch is Another city, bought with eight thousand pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the frame, and the pair of Helen, it took less than forty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
