			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The head of the policeman, Dulfa Ronchi, is tall, energetic, gloomy, and looks like a vulture in the wilderness looking for carrion. Those who only know how to do it, Zall's wrist is more skillful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also a police newcomer to a small town, and he is quite outstanding when he patrols the small patrol on the street every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, Zall method chews the toast on the street - the small patrol can only eat this at noon, two thin breads sandwiched with sausages, cheap and replenished Physical strength, when passing by a coffee shop, the situation inside caught his attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great noon, it’s the most profitable moment in the catering industry, but the door to the cafe is closed, and the “suspended business” sign is hanging on the door. Occasionally, the embarrassment came out and quickly calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked on the door. It took a long time for someone to answer, "Mr., it is not open today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The voice is flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today's 'tax money' you haven't paid, it's been dragged for two days!" Zall said, "Do you want to be sealed tomorrow!" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small town in the chaos of justice, a common phenomenon, shops on time to the police and mixed votes, in exchange for protection from harassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the old patrolman is usually rich and fluid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, the door was opened, and the owner of the coffee shop pinched the ticket and half-covered the door, his eyes swept over him, and turned back. Squeezing his eyes, Zall Law pretended not to glimpse, against the door that was about to close, and went straight in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me a cup of coffee, keep a book." He shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four or five customers sitting in the store are silent, and the three masked people who are obviously robbers surround him. There was a robber behind the door. After he came in, he immediately closed the door and put on the bolt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One to four. There is no chance of winning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The customers who are under threats sigh in the bottom of their hearts, and the boss is even more secretive. "Where I stayed in the police, I made a lot of eyes. You just didn't know, just know the pigs who took the money!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zall's law suddenly came to a robber, and he took a chair and sat down. Before they acted, they shouted, "Coffee is on the verge!" and then honestly said to the robbers, "Hey, the protection fee should be like this, too violent, will scare away customers, no income, the store will open If we don't go down, then we all have less harvest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authorities and the gang help each other. mutually beneficial. It is also a common phenomenon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the boss of Terry's boss, take the money and go, after all, my identity is here. Don't let everyone face."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robbers were relieved, and the idiots who came in had admit the wrong people and treated them as local gang members. "Terry boss? Who knows him? It just confuses the line of sight." When the police found the truth, they flew away in the morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, happy cooperation." The robber said, put away the weapon, carrying it full A bag of cash and customer wallet jewelry at the counter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say hello to Terry's boss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, yes." Zallfa patted his head. He took a robber who was close to his own body and whispered, "I owe the two thousand pieces of Terry's boss to expire, ready to go back at night, meet you, just help me hand over."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, must be handed over." Sure enough, idiot, two thousand? It is estimated that there are not so many grabs today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Going to the back hall, I don't want everyone to know. A policeman in the town owes a loan shark due to excessive gambling."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robbers hesitated, and greed finally gained the upper hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back hall, Zall Law glared at the robbers and stared at the wallet, directly stunned him, and worked neatly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knelt down his clothes and hood and put it on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the other three looters found that they were not right, it was already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next beggar was a robber with a bag, and Zall's sword pierced his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss, go out from the back door, call the police!" Zall Law took the sword and the remaining two, holding the big bag full of money At the foot, command the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no back door, but the two robbers didn’t know and had to flee in a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any injured?" Zall was asked by sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, but the cook screamed and may be hurt. I will go see it." The boss replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zall law prevented him, "Don't ruin the scene, you stay in the hall to appease the guests, and go to the police."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kitchen is in another semi-enclosed room, the knives on the kitchen's cook's feet are smashed, and a pile of blood is accumulated on the floor. It is painfully squatting, seeing Zall Law appear, like Looking at the savior like, "I beg you, hurry up and look for the doctor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're fine." Zall method checked, did not hurt Arteries, if treated promptly, are not life-threatening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could it be okay! I am dying!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the regulations, cracked together Killing the case, you can remember the second-class work.” Zall Law was kneeling beside the chef. “But it was robbed of a few hundred dollars, and only one small case with minor injuries was praised at most.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chef is puzzled. "What do you say about this? I need a doctor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a newcomer The newcomer, to be promoted, must have merit." Zall's hand wrapped the knife still stuck in the chef's lap, coldly said, "Hey, as long as you die, the small case can become a big case. Don't hate me, hate and hate the rules of the authorities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the police station received the alarm and sent a half-team patrolman, everything was over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two knives, the second knife cut off the aorta, and the excessive blood loss caused the victim to die within a few minutes." The forensic officer reported after the autopsy. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person died, six people were robbed, and the bureau issued a wanted order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just smashed the chef." When the last two robbers were caught, they shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one believes their words, using chemical detection results, only the robber's fingerprint on the handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one doubts, relying on wisdom to save the big heroes of all the customers in the cafe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case with Zall Law Longch, which began to be reused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took only ten years from the patrol team, to the inspector, to the captain of the secret police department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is unscrupulous, ruthless, and resourceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7:20. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is completely dark. In the vast night, there is a little yellow light on the far end of the road. It is the light that the coach of the station is outside the compartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zolf Lungi is ready for the men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grey hair, with a beard, middle-aged, pseudonym Carl Tiven. This is the object that he wants to arrest. The characteristics are too vague. There are at least 20 people in a hundred people.
