When the fog is gone, the pedestrians on the road will be surprised to find that the departure is still dark and gray, no The bright dawn has become a clear sky with the sun hanging high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-spirited gangster Igo Andech is now like a wolf-escaped guinea pig. In less than a year, his authority was completely broken. . The gorse is unexpectedly neutral, and Igo has no way to save. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the group of omnipotent supernaturals, his cronies, like the plants in the wheat fields, were harvested irresistibly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood war, the tradition of the underground world, the Round Table Council will treat both sides of the war fairly, and the winner will replace the loser and become a more authoritative amnesty . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joe, I won't let you go!" Igo hated and said, he looked at the car and hoped that Wei Wener would come back alive. This is He is the only one who can master the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small things, hey, don't run." The woman grunted, her face was soft and gentle like a warm spring, under the moonlight, trees The cold and clear reflections are like whispering, "Repose, rest in peace..." She stood in the shadows, and the green eyes kept sweeping past her from the bush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Wener Cecilia shrinks her head in fear and tries to hide her body under the leaves of the bush. "Monster, that is a monster!" She wants to cry. Also afraid of the choked voice provoked the monster's awareness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week ago, she was still a princess who was favored by the underground world. Even the uncle Uncle Igo saw her, she had to put up a smile and said with awkwardness. "Is your stomach hungry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God knows how old he is, so the lady has to pay attention to dieting, so she only ate five pounds of barbecue and four Honey fried fish, clams, plus three plates of cake and a few large glasses of juice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Wener stretched her tongue and abandoned the messy thoughts from her mind. She tried to remember everything that happened: "Damn, the group of pigs actually dared to launch bad blood." War! The Round Table Council has defaulted to this betrayal!" Uncle Igo yelled. Then the war began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle Igo fled with her, and she also turned the chasing soldiers into stones, but the monster that looked like a big sister appeared. For a moment, the secret guards following the uncle could no longer be sent. use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Baby, stop blocking her." Uncle said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she jumped out of the carriage, she walked out of the shelter. When it comes to launching your own abilities, it is useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small things, even if they belong to the same king level, there will be differences." The monster smiled, the black air mass almost made her beautiful tail disappear, she did not dare After playing, I wanted to run back to my uncle, but I found that Uncle Igo had already drove in a carriage and walked away without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retract the nails on the palm of your hand. Wei Wener squinted at the monster's figure. I found a direction indiscriminately and ran away desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is light than speed, then she can be much smarter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is a king, aristocrat, a rich man, a gangster. Power, there is always a deadline. Maybe even the majesty of the gods has a deadline, who knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golden Horn Bay, unconsciously, began to spread a mysterious rumor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial investor Harvey touched a small pistol and fell into madness, his eyes squirting fire, he thought, "Give that guy a shot, what hate It is!" He walked around the office. The secretary pushed the door in once and saw the scene, timidly and quietly closing the door back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a betrayal! It is a conspiracy! The guy took advantage of his friendship and also kicked him into the abyss! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a veteran of the financial world, how could he be so naive? "Oh, in your reputation, the bank can't refuse." When the friend loaned and asked him to guarantee, Harvey was proud of his friend's compliment. Everyone knows that Harvey is a reputable person with vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is a despicable scam. Harvey knows that the friend who declared the investment failed and went bankrupt, in fact, transferred the property secret to another account. But he has no evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, you are the guarantor, and the credibility is excellent, the loan is almost expired, please don't let us be embarrassed." Bank people say so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He repaid the money at the end of the month, and there was another one in the next month. As an investor who circled the money, he didn’t have so much cash. To cope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harvey can imagine that this will be a disaster, his reputation and status will be due to the chain reaction of the loan, and the subpoena of the commercial court. And a mess! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last reason discouraged him from using blood to wash his thoughts of anger and hatred. Harvey suddenly thought of some mysterious news he had heard. Maybe the crow can help him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the secretary carefully took the police into the office and shouted, "Sir, don't do this." Harvey had already sat back in the chair and smiled and explained. "Hey, you misunderstood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sent the patrolman and asked the secretary to give himself a cup of coffee. Harvey reached into his pocket and touched the pistol. I thought, "Go to the crow. Now, you can only rely on him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exquisite cuisine of the dishes exudes a seductive atmosphere. The first dish is Cao. The juice is fishy, ​​the second dish is the white snail meat of the mushroom, as well as the foie gras and the creamy loin. The cutlery is sterling silver, and the handles are engraved with beautiful patterns. The handles are also inlaid with small pieces of small diamonds, like the crafts that should be placed in the collection cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear, you are great." The enchanting woman looked at the fat man opposite, and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Try this bottle of citron, the imported goods from Portugal and the Netherlands, you have four hundred sesame in one bottle." The fat man showed off, which led to a burst of exclamation. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two of them came out of the hotel with satisfaction, when they stepped onto the carriage, they did not notice at all, and a hateful gaze stared at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore is the second officer of the ocean freighter. He stayed on the boat for most of the year. In the hands of the water, he is a rare alien who is self-disciplined because In his small town in his hometown, there is a girl who loves her true love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the captain, the girl, and a group of big fat boys, this is Moore’s pursuit and dream, but now, he found that the beautiful dream has been Tear into pieces full of satire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rich man who was over half a hundred years tempted the girl's heart with a ticket. At first Moore heard a little wind. He didn't believe it, but today he witnessed it and ruthlessly trampled on his last hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The younger second thought of death, died, everything was free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the carriage coming from a distant car, rushed over, and closed his eyes to wait for the pain and the scythe of death. After a few seconds. Nothing happened. The coachman took the reins and let the car stop half a meter in front of him. "Do you have a long eye?" The driver wiped his sweat and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mur was on the ground, holding his head, and then he was trembling and alive. Better than death. He can also work towards the captain's position, and he can marry another pure girl. The premise of this is that he can continue to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That damn rich man!" Moore thought, he couldn't give up so silently. The sailor, usually the most sensitive profession, heard a message that although there was a ghost ship-like magic in the rumor, Mull would rather believe that the news was true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Going to the crow, he can help me out this tone." Moore muttered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head. What to do. If he is imprisoned, he will definitely die." The subordinate said, "The warden is a friend of the Monroe gang. I will never let go of the wheat gram."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How does the lawyer say?" The gang leader Vito is anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have no way, the president and prosecutor of the presiding judge are hard-line, do not eat our set."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn, I spent a lot of money but raised a group of waste. Vitto thought indignantly that wheat is his most beloved son, only 15 years old this year. A few months ago, in the gang fight, he killed a powerful man of Monroe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is nothing, and Vito is proud of his son’s bravery. But unfortunately, the patrolman who was rushed to the wheat was caught on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent a lot of money. Only the big figures in the judiciary hinted that it would not be the death penalty, but the imprisonment for 20 years can not be less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years of imprisonment is nothing, and for up to a year, he can find a relationship and rescue his son from the cell. But the prison in this city is the sphere of influence of Monroe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I swear, the boy came to the prison. I can live for half a week, I will let the site out." Monroe smirked and announced on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I can't let my son go to jail, um, I have to find a way to get him into the church's penance." Vito thought, he and the bishop were a bit Friendship, the church has promised not to refuse. The prosecutor is not willing to let go, insisting that wheat must be served in a secular prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a day to go to the verdict, and Vitto is anxious like a frog in hot water. He suddenly thought of a rumor, as long as he is willing to promise a certain request, then someone is willing to help any, and will certainly help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crow? Is there anyone in the underground world? Take care of him, as long as the wheat is safe and sound." Vito thinks, but whether the rumors are true or false This is the last straw that he can catch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medida is very cleverly sitting next to the secretary, with big eyes and skirts, making the girl look like a beautiful doll. The white gold hair was a little messy, and the secretary was grooming her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that person your father?" asked the secretary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, he is a good-hearted uncle, will help me find my father." Mattida smirked with big eyes and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then he didn't do anything disgusting with you, like..." The secretary played the imagination and the protection of the motherhood, she went to the In the office of the director, the secret policeman with a gloomy taste is very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is, for example?" Matilda asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, for example, he has to change clothes for you, you have to sleep with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "It won't be, Ma Dida can wear clothes by himself, it's amazing." The girl said off, "Good-hearted uncle doesn't like to talk. Every time he goes home, he shuts himself in the room, no one. Play with Matida."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
