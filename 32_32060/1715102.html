			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The magic crystal of the light seems to want to expel the dark atmosphere, silently emitting light on the wall of the huanghuali wood, I do not know when, from the window The small moth that came in through the gap, followed the light source, flew in the petal-shaped lighting, and then stopped on the milky white translucent glass lampshade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lady raised her face slightly, and the small chin and the slender neck showed an arrogant angle, like the ivory skin bathed in the light, look Indifference, the eyelids occasionally flashed a few tassels of vigilance and suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She squirmed slightly under the rosy lips, seemed to want to talk, but no sound came out, she seemed to want to play with him a small, caring The game, to see who can not help, first opened the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Fryer has been staring at Peggy’s face, the black eyes are in the faint light, like an abyss of the soul, no bright Endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former prosecutor who died and resurrected had riots in his mind, such as the undercurrent of calm water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what he has been restraining. When he was transformed into Quasimodo, he must be modest and humbly to cover up his true purpose, but now he uses another appearance, and the other has already shown a hostile identity, sitting in front of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He no longer has to suppress his own emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trump card is in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly pulled out a superb five-wheeled revolver from the inner pocket of the jacket, which did not cause Peggy’s uneasiness, the girl Pulling the hair hanging from the shoulder with a slender finger, slightly tilting his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A cautious person, at least in front of a stranger, searched his body." He finally opened his mouth, "maybe you lurk in In the eyes of many guards in the dark, a small gun is insignificant, but now, I obviously can take your life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need, you bother I tried to see me, not for a chance of assassination." She leaned back and leaned back, half lying on a purple plush mat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to think that everything is under your control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you not think that all things, rights, wealth, or the lives of others are dominated? Is manipulation a very interesting thing?" Missy shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evil thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say, you kidnapped my husband, yes In order to get what?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran opened the gun and pulled the bullet out. Spread out the palm of your hand, "This five-particle bomb, this represents my hostility, you should be able to eliminate them." Then he slowly stuffed them back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rhetoric of the corner, and the insatiable greed. Five requirements? Do you regard me as a responsive singer?" Peggy’s eyes contained sneer, "and listen Listen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing what the enemy is seeking, you can make a countermeasure, Missy thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other person wants a lot of wealth, it means that the man is just a matter of being filled with greed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is to release a heavy criminal, then she can follow the vine. Find out the true identity of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to get power, day. She really wants to laugh, no one will be stupid enough to use this method to get on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is concentrating on listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan stood up and pushed the door of the carriage. “The first request, I always wanted to walk with the beautiful and noble lady like you, on the beach under the morning sun.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peji can’t analyze this. Intention, she thought it might be a teasing gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the situation tends to the other side, as long as she has not seen her husband, she can’t fight back and can only bear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I forced me to go to the tidal flat to blow the cold wind?" Peggy swears and swears, waiting for her to figure out the details of this strange man, to save and master the Crown Prince. after that. Let this guy go to hell to blow the infinite gloom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tulle-like fog makes the sea seem to be still in a quiet sleep, looking far away, the distant reef and the small coral island, faintly only a shadow that is not clear, but the eastern sky has already been coated with a layer Light red brilliance, irresistible power, will soon awaken heaven and earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black speedboat is hidden behind a rock on an island. The orc, Lori Cecilia, was sweaty and showed a pitiful expression. Her dragon's power was used to the limit, and the whole boat was covered under the shelter of "Nepenthes", even if it had the ability to check the distance. The dragon maiden, the mage who is performing the eagle eye, will think that there is nothing left in the rock, only the waves that sway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautita Whiteman holds a telescope, the distance is just right, there is no obstruction on the sea, and the scene on the beach is unmistakable under the lens. She touted. "Looking at the sun with the head, I haven't enjoyed this romantic thing. Byron's storage is also a **." The girl thought indignantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But everything has to be arranged as planned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crown Prince Julius was forced to administer medicine in the past few days, and his spirit is much more stable, but he is still in a self-pity mood. Among them, the kidnappers were very courteous to him. Every morning and evening, he was free to take a walk on the deck and breathe fresh air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the wind, yes, it is the wind, this ship is my prison!" he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was deeply breathed with the smell of the sea breeze, and felt a little comfort for this temporary freedom. On the upper deck, Chu Jun saw one of the leaders of the kidnappers. , a young girl, is not far from what is concerned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Qing Ben Jiaren, but why is a thief." This is the Eastern proverb, Julius is like a poet, can not help but come up with this sentence in his heart, He shook his head and prepared to leave. "It seems that the head and Wang Hao talked very speculatively, then..." The wind brought the girl's whisper to the ear of Julius, possibly deliberately speaking to him, but Chu Jun He suddenly turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wang Hao? Is it my wife? Do the gangsters also want to be bad for Peggy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He was like a wild beast that suddenly violently rushed over, and he quickly watched his guards on the side and did not respond. He pushed the girl away, took the telescope, and put it in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the faint smog like a tulle, he saw two blurred figures on the far beach, so that he could not see the appearance, but Julius still recognized that one of them was His beloved wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can he not recognize it? Peggy's appearance has appeared countless times in his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other should be the murderer who kidnapped him. He knew the figure of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his leader and bent down, seemingly close to his wife intimately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, I will curse you with the most vicious language! What is coming to me, don't think about cheating her, hurting her!" The ground groaned and trembled with excitement. He gasped and his hands clenched into fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take him down. Our guests are too excited." Lauvita slammed into the fence, some painful shoulders, meaningful The ground raised his eyebrows and smiled with a hint of mockery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This abominable smile is more confusing than a thousand words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ship and boat, when a little calm down, a strange sense of fear rose in the heart of Julius, he is weak and kind, but not a The idiot of the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He examines the experiences that have taken place on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows that they have a serious mental illness. But the kidnappers are clear and clear, it is this use of this, abducted him out of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy really don’t know? Although they have not shared the same bed, they live under the same roof and are free to enter and exit each other's room. Maybe one day, he left a medicine bottle? Or, the doctor of the doctor, Dr. Tyan, unconsciously said that he had revealed his mouth before his death? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the lens of the genius, he did not find the guards guarding the strict. It is not like the tension between the two sides. On the beach, there are only two wives and gangsters, and it is not like the kidnappers and the victims are negotiating. Instead, it is like...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these thoughts flashed in my mind, because Julius could not continue to imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She won't hurt me." He groaned miserably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Peggy will not harm me, she is the love of my life." For a long time, he firmly said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the reading of the gods in the stone clearly understands what happened through Julius, and is also surprised by the manners of the kidnappers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is silent, and there is a happy encounter in nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer is irritated by the props that it regards as a rebirth carrier, in terms of mental condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hate doctors, damn, as long as his ills continue to deteriorate. I can invade and occupy."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stone is one of the antiquities of the Holy See. In Anno’s papers, it has long been lost. Until ten years ago, the Archbishop of the Dark Hall, Rio Anguters, discovered through experiments. It is useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wonderful and incredible, it can replace the human body, store the soul, as long as it is not damaged. It can make me endlessly exist." Self-speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But forever living in a stone without **, that eternal life has no meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devoutness of the sorcerer was finally overwhelmed by **, he betrayed the Holy See, theft of the Eternal Cabinet, the use of heretical technology and the magic of Anno A perfect body, trying to become a new god. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as you know, the sorcerer’s failure is wrong, he loses his body and can only live on the soul stone, waiting for complete restoration. Birthplace opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is now in sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human brain is complex and fragile. If he leaves the soul stone and tries to occupy anyone's body, two completely different sound minds fight in the brain, no matter which The victory of the party will completely destroy the brain and become an unconscious vegetative person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spirit of the carrier must be completely broken, then I can become the new Julius without any difficulty, and then the Byron successor The identity, get the sacred objects guarded by the great emperor, and restore the power with the power of the eternal cabinet." The sorcerer thought, "My kingdom of the world, starting from the powerful country of Byron." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is brewing, and at the crucial moment, it will help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy does not have much enthusiasm for the breezy morning beach, the dreamy sunset, but walks and talks with this weird kidnapper Not a bad thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hypocritically exchanged topics and talked about many issues related to philosophy, law, and social cognition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uninformed people look over, this pair of men and women seem to be familiar old friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eternal debate of light and darkness, good and evil, they are tit for tat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The virtues of goodness, evil acts, in the final analysis, are the ultimate benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What do you think of good and evil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never thought there was good and evil." The girl replied, "but only power." The difference, the powerful person, the act is evil and hypocritical in the eyes of the weak, and the so-called good character is only an incompetent performance, and should not be praised, because they are only lacking in power to do evil. Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven’t talked to people for a long time, I have to say that this guy is a smart person. It is a pity that the crime is too great, otherwise I will conceive the idea and slowly adjust the training. Peggy thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is as always, likes to trample and despise the conscience of justice. Fran thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows what the young lady loves, and at the table in Feidu, they argued countless times, each time Peggy provoked . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, I love to see your excited and embarrassed expression. A naive pity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, when she talked about the end, she laughed as if she had got a happy life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The jungle law of natural selection, using the weak meat to replace the social order of people's morality." Fran's eyes were sewed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The position seems to have reversed. It is hard to imagine that this is a kidnapper, in the presence of the victim's family, said what he said." Peggy said with a smile, but there was no joy in the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." He also smiled and his tone was equally cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hostile position stopped them from continuing to talk. Return to reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy converges on the smile. "The communication is over. I want to know what you want and I will release Julius. Return him to my hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, The second request.” Fran handed her a thin blog to her. “I need everyone who is recorded above to get the punishment I deserve.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Missy opened the book and read several names. "Howard, the elders of the Philadelphia Metropolitan Assembly, an anonymous account at Shuangying Bank, remitted 14,000 pieces per month... Casey, Commerce Bureau The second longest. The common income is 120,000, 60% belongs to him, and the whole amount is exchanged for the futures bond, which has been transferred to his account..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a The blacklist of the power transaction records the crimes committed by many senior officials in the Golden Bay area to participate in smuggling. The details are detailed and can be used as a non-rebuttable evidence in the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran got the list from his safe after he punished the betrayal of the giant boxing Kregan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Weirdly ask. Who are you? In the dark, punish the justice of the criminals?" Peggy was puzzled. "You would rather bear the sky." The crime is to send a group of stupid monkeys to prison?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not punishment, it is revenge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Revenge..." Missy thought of something. "Before I came to Feidu, Golden Bay once cleaned up a large-scale smuggling group. Are you a fish in the net?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can think so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hate is indeed wine, people are intoxicated, but why should I help you? It is an enemy to the bureaucratic class in the Gulf. It is not difficult for me, but it will cause a lot of trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
