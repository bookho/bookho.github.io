			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Riddle Don Leinschmann woke up from the darkness, his headache was terrible, his eyes were red and shimmering, and so on. When he recalled what happened, the horror was born, and he only felt a cold air hit the whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding black hole, in the darkness can only see some vague outlines, under the bumps, this is a narrow space in motion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick hemp rope is tied to the ankle of the wrist, tightly stretched, almost bleeding, a stinky cloth in his mouth, Riddle from the light One foot speculates that it should be its own cotton socks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least there is good news, I only wore a day for the socks." Riddle was having fun, he knew how to relax as much as possible to keep his mind calm and lost his soul. The embarrassment has no effect on the current situation and can only make things worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continues to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the kidnappers of money? No, it is easy to solve eight well-trained bodyguards, but it is not an ordinary character; is it an enemy? Riddle couldn't remember the resentment he had solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the wood board suddenly came from the ear, and Riddle immediately held his breath, closed his eyes, and kept the stiff posture before the coma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet awake. "In the ear is a weird voice, the voice is blurred, like a walnut in the mouth, can not hear men and women, then The man quickly closed the door again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Riddle quickly opened his eyes and tried to reach his head to the door. He identified that it was a large carriage that had been remodeled inside and was driving on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the commission, the kid must be punished." I don’t know if it was intentional or not, the door panel was not closed, leaving a little gap, and the head couldn’t make it. I can't see the outside situation, but I can barely hear the subtle conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, what should we do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is obviously hesitant, "The victim I don't want to get into big troubles, but I have to let the adulterer who goes to bed with other people's husbands understand. How to manage the stuff of his own." Is his beautiful lover Naomi's husband playing a ghost? A mad man who is insulted by honor, can do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But is it so simple? The door just did not close, this conversation seems to be deliberately told to listen to yourself, one seems to be inadvertently revealing the wind, but after careful thinking, it feels that there is a trap of something in front of him, the kidnapper wants to conceal the real behind the scenes Master. Riddle's mind is very flexible. The gorse has never been an idiot. He lay on the floor of the carriage and thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go and give the guy a shot. Lest he wake up halfway." Soon, Riddle felt a sharp, fine needle piercing violently. The skin, the vertigo that followed, made his consciousness more and more blurred. "You don't want to wake up halfway? They knew that I woke up, damn, let me find out..." Riddle's mouth was slightly faint before he was in a coma again. There was a sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Constantine Byron’s great emperor Joan VIII coughed, He felt that his body was getting weaker and weaker, and he was like a wilted old tree, except for the occasional flashing clearness in his eyes. Old, full of graves. The wind whistling in winter. Just like the footsteps of the ubiquitous god of death, always reminding your majesty:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days of the Lord's summoning are getting closer and closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The experiment is still going on, although we have concentrated on the most authoritative professors in the industry. But they all say that the research object almost violates the laws of reality and is currently Use a spectral detector to find the truth that is submerged in mythology. "The emperor's loyal old director said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The school of physics, chemistry, nature...science, the concept is mixed, such as the concept of gravity, they have ten kinds of explanations." Yoan eight The old bark-like wrinkles on the face of the world are getting deeper and deeper. "But according to the notes found in the underground and the sacred objects of the capital, the Anno scorpion god has been close to success, and almost got immortal."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Immortal, does it really exist?" the old supervisor said suspiciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need to be immortal. Give me another five years, no, ten years, I can build a solid and unshakable position for the royal family, let the domestic forces Balance the state of mutual restraint, and clear the way to the children. The gorse? Byron's authority should be the royal golden lion head eagle. I can only rely on it for the eternal cabinet. For this, even with Anno "The emperor thought about his chest, he asked again." "My old friend, have you been in trouble recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second son of Speaker Leinschmann was kidnapped." The old loyal executive of the emperor replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blackmail money? Threat political compromise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our agent is analyzing, It is puzzling that the dirty kidnappers did not pass any requirements. Moreover, from the situation on the spot, the other party seems to have the ability to transcend nature.” The supervisor remembered the probe's description, at least four bodyguards, muscles. With bones, it is melted by inexplicable high temperature into a fat that has solidified into a hard block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pure revenge?" The emperor smiled, but the cheerful expression was interrupted by a severe cough. He waved his hand. "Not only me, Byron." The less noble family, more or less dissatisfied with Reinschmann, the lions will be revered when they are arrogant, but as long as they show signs of aging, they will seek to eat a bite."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean, let's sit back and ignore?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, the current enemy of Reinschmann is a The madman is still a madman who controls the supernatural power, puts the panic into action, politics, and can't rely solely on terrorist acts. Although he has done a great job, he has passed." The emperor replied, "Let the blood knight come out and find him. Try to control him. If you can't, remove it. A formal and Byron's top family is the enemy's power, and it won't suddenly appear out of thin air. I want to see its true face."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true face is a beautiful face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautita Whitemane is obsessively observing the puppet dolls sitting on the edge of the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cluster of lace and layered skirts dress the samurai girl as a princess in a fairy tale, if not witnessing the summoned by her Flame, Lauvita can not believe that in this weak body, there is a great power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a great tool that is easy to use and labor-saving." She held up Ma Dida’s slender chin and looked at the natural fragrance that was submerged under the numb expression. "Big breasts, plus your hoe with a ** face, the head around the old around the beautiful girl, it is really unpleasant." Lauvita made a fierce expression, "Please rest assured, chasing yourself The enemy is well fed, only the head will be so gentle. I am a bad woman who is poisonous, and I will definitely lose your value without even the bone marrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;I don't know if I had a cheek pain in my hand, or I felt the maliciousness in my heart. Matilda began to struggle uncomfortably, and the boring and innocent bar was mixed with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bad woman Yingying went to the cupboard and took out the box made of the whole piece of jade from the drawer with the hidden lock. She unveiled the vine with silver. The foil-wrapped lid is screwed to the fingertips with a light cyan scented meatball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s time to take medicine." Lauvita smiled. Put the pill into the blushing lips of the holy warrior girl, watching her and her mouth squirting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mouth is open." Lauvita is cautious, she knows that if the other person wakes up, an unattainable dangerous tool will bring disaster, girl Carefully examine the mouth and even poke the finger in, gently flipping the wet tongue and making sure that the potion has entered the stomach of the holy warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When wearing a white care suit, Lila Berry entered the bedroom, the scene was so bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two beautiful girls like flowers, are squatting together in strange postures. Rosette, a flamboyant and thorny rose, is condescending with a pair of pink fingers on his tongue. Matilda’s throat whispers in his throat, his face pale and pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe in the eyes of some men. The intimate contact between the beautiful children is a pleasing temperament, but for Lila, who has a very healthy psychological orientation, it is difficult to understand the life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing!" She screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautta took out his fingers and pulled out a silvery slender saliva, "Check the body." She replied carelessly, rubbing her handkerchief and rubbing her hands, slightly Emei, every time I see this nurse, Lauvita will think of the experience of the limestone mountains. She is similar to the female devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s nine o'clock in the evening. It’s time to measure the body temperature, and, please don’t do strange things.” Lila said angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, take care of her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a question I have to ask you Why is there a man in the basement who is tied to a coma?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are just a little care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I have the right to choose who to work for, you are illegally banned!" Lila said with a sense of justice "I don't want to be involved in any sinful incident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The man owed a large sum of money to the firm, a small punishment. Please be assured, Immediately, he will leave him unscathed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, a profiteer who has no evil!" Li La thought. If it wasn’t for the pitiful and lovely little Matida, the girl had already resigned and would not follow them to the south. Miss Whiteman told her that this is a visit to a famous doctor in the country to treat Matilda's brain disease. She needs a professional nursing. Although Lila is very happy to be called a professional, she always feels that something is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t like the female secretary of the traitor Casimodo. Although it seems that the other person treats people with gentleness and goodness, the girl’s heart vaguely feels that this woman’s attitude towards Matida is not as superficial as she cares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it’s the eyes. When she looked at Matida, she didn't look at the patient's compassion and sympathy, nor the care of family and friends, but... like the owner of the store, looking at the goods at the bottom of the warehouse, thinking about how to sell it. A good price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really is what kind of subordinates will be there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you go to the basement to deliver the meal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I always feel that your working hours don't match the generous commissions you get." Lauvita said, when she was in a sanatorium on the outskirts of Tantin. When I first saw this woman named Lila Berry, I had a good idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the female secretary walking out of the room, Lila groaned, "I hate this person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She felt that the clothes had been pulled, and Matida clutched her clothes tightly, as if trying to make her effort, causing the knuckles to be white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be afraid, I will protect you, you have to get better soon." Lila promised. Although some people don't think it, she and Ma Tida are accompanied by each other, sometimes they have to watch the night, and even sleep in the same bed. Lila obviously feels that the little Ma Tida's eyes are no longer utterly dull, at least so much. A trace of vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the patient slowly licked his face and gave a slight gentle breath, Lila sighed. She closed the window and went to the kitchen to put the cool butter potatoes and stewed rape into the lunch box. In the corridor, walk towards the basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two physically strong, bodyguards in custom-made grey jackets, Minhou on both sides of the aisle, reaching out to block her, "Please stay."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was Miss Whitemane who asked me to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bodyguards glanced at each other, "Don't go in Speak and do a good job and come out immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only a dim kerosene lamp in the room, and Lila put down the lunch box with his hands and feet, and when he was ready to leave, he could not bear it. Lived and cringed in the corner, locked by the ankles. The man who was still sleeping was shaking his head and thinking, "It’s not a good thing to owe debts, especially the money owed to the profiteer. I wish you good luck. I hope that the bad woman is telling the truth, just a little lesson, tomorrow. Will let you go, or I must want to call the police. "Ridel woke up early, calming the effectiveness of the pharmacy has passed, he squinted, secretly squatting into the woman who came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time he saw the true face of the kidnappers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s good luck, the light of the kerosene lamp is dim, but the angle is very good, it is a pretty woman, green eyes, pretty nose, blonde, figure slim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They mistakenly thought that I was still in a coma, so I relaxed my vigilance, very good, and finally I found a leak." Riddle gnashed his teeth, "Wait for me to recover." Freedom, this will be a good clue that I will find the black hand behind the scenes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lay on the cold ground and analyzed who would poison his own hands. Omi’s husband has been excluded. The family is very powerful, but he does not dare to be an enemy of the gorse. The kidnappers have never talked to them about ransom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An idea suddenly broke into the brain: the struggle inside the family? Someone is warning themselves, don’t blame anything extra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it big brother, younger brother, or that is not a big deal, but always thinking about getting the benefits? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
