At the end of the month, the preparation ceremony for the seal is nearing the end, and the small town can immediately have more new nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran they still did not find evidence to prove the terrible thing in speculation. The mayor suddenly did not go to church. It seemed that someone had pretended to be a god to listen to his confession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a good person." Lauvita said, "We should not frame a good person for profit."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The woman's heart is soft." Kregan disdain, "If he really wants to be a sacred saint, he has to suffer, I don't mind playing a while while getting some money. The role of the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franland smiled. "Don’t be in a hurry, we may be able to find information from the old man of Mr. Luda."

Since her husband died, very few people came to visit her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Perry. I used to be an apprentice of Qiu Ke’s law firm. I am sorry, because I just returned to Byron, I know that my teacher has passed away." The man who looks like Sven stands in front of the door and holds a bunch of white calamus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, please come in." Mrs. Qiu Ke was quite moved. Qiu Ke is a famous barrister. Most of the students taught are now in the industry. Elite, but when people die, those elites will never come again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perry probably stayed at Qiuke’s house for two hours and stayed in the study for a long time, “Hah, this book teacher has loaned me I have seen it." He looked at the bookshelf and felt it from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Qiu Ke is not short of money, but she hates to be deserted, so I am very grateful to this man for bringing popularity to the family in the cold winter. When leaving, Perry was embarrassed to ask, "Can I take away some of the teacher's relics, as a commemoration?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, in the winter, It’s very troublesome to take care of the old man’s study. Take a few books and go. You have helped.” Mrs. Qiuke said slyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After going out, he went straight to the carriage, and Kregan was sitting in the carriage. "Man, what's the harvest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quke lawyer is really meticulous. People and documents were properly filed. Luda’s family was one of his clients.” Fran took off the disguised glasses and wigs. “In those contracts, I found something interesting.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This works 16k novel network exclusive text version of the first release, without permission can not be reproduced, excerpts, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Testament?" Channing stopped the action of cutting the steak. I looked at the lawyer who had known for a long time and asked strangely. He is wearing a nice purple coat and his little riding boots are clean. This is his only set of clothes that are ok. Although he lives in a dilapidated rented house, although there is not much money in his pocket, Channing Luda still Efforts have shown that he is different from ordinary people around him. The clothes are sent to the laundry room for washing. Usually, he will slip into the cafe to pour an afternoon of cheap coffee, and he has to take the carriage when he goes out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first the residents of this street called his lord in awe. Privately talk about why a rich man will move to them. But the time is not long. The landlord of Channing quickly revealed the secret, which is just a bankrupt who likes to put on the shelf. In this regard, the defeated sons who have been fascinated by the scenery are very dissatisfied. Even looking for a long tongue landlord theory, then he remembered that if he turned his face, it would be difficult to find such a cheap house, so he dismissed the idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday I just got a ticket from my sister, and Qian Ning couldn’t wait to find old friends to play a night card. The luck was as bad as being cursed by evil spirits. By the dawn, the purse was almost empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked home vainly as he passed the tobacco shop. He touched his pocket, no smoke, just prepared to go in and buy some, suddenly remembered that he still owed the boss twelve dollars, the day before when he was ready to remove a few small cigars, the boss refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have already sent me twelve pieces. I am very principled. People who have work but have tight hands can pick up twenty. Block." The boss said at the time. "More than two dollars for you, I am already very respectful of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twelve! District 12! This is not enough for me to give Others' rewards." Qian Ning, he wants to smoke now, but the boss will first let him pay back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qian Ning counted the money, only a few silver horns left. He sighed and prepared to leave, but he heard someone calling behind him. "Is it Mr. Channing Luda?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;A middle-aged gentleman wearing a brown trench coat and handsome, just looking down from the carriage, looking very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You forgot, I am Perry, that year Apprentice Qiu Ke teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qiu Ke? After spending a lot of money, Qian Ning only remembered the name from the depths of his memory. It was his father’s counsel, and he seemed to have died in the previous two years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Qiu Kedi students, I remembered." Qian Ning said with a smile, in fact, he had no impression of this person called Perry. As a young master, how can he remember the appearance of a lawyer apprentice more than a decade ago, "Hey, look at your dress and mix well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Of course, I am currently working at a prestigious law firm.” Perry said, “If you need legal services, you can come to me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe." Qian Ning replied. Hey, the elementary schoolers in the family used to have money more than me. The world has changed. He thinks slyly. Reluctantly, I should accept a few words. When Qian Ning wants to leave, the tobacco shop owner happened to pass by. When he saw him, he shouted, "Sir, you still owe me twelve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will return you next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should go to the clothes and be worth a lot of money." The tobacco boss looked at the coat. "I am a small business. If you owe twelve banks, you will have to pay 15 yuan for interest, and I am honestly only looking for you to get back twelve."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chen Ning is very annoyed that the other side has dismantled the plight of his own destiny, and repeated the twelve figures that should have been negligible several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will return this gentleman’s debt." Perry sent a gold roll, "take another box of cigars, with cedar Handmade fine cigars in paper baskets." "As you can see, I have gone bankrupt." Qian Ning said very unpleasantly, "Thank you for your generosity, but I have no money to let lawyers earn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawyer Perry looked at him affectionately. "Please don't imagine me as a snobbish villain. You haven't eaten yet. I just booked a location at the hotel facing the street."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a scene at the beginning of the hotel table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry to remind you of the father who died, I just talked casually." Perry cut a belly filled with cream and mushrooms. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The father is sick and dying, his heart has been bad." Qian Ning sighed, "Because he went suddenly, he did not leave a will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a tragedy, but it’s also a blessing when you die in your child’s tears.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money Ning put down the knife and fork and said with a sad tone. "At that time, my brother and I were not in the city. Only my sister and my brother-in-law, when I came back, I could only pray in front of the spiritual pivot of the church." He suddenly thought of something worthy of improving his identity. "My brother-in-law is the city." Mayor, maybe he will need a consultant lawyer, I can introduce it for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Perry nodded and thanked. I muttered to myself, "You are not with the young master, but the master just died. According to the draft, the biggest benefit is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Draft?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, nothing, very distant things, it’s no longer meaningful.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No, you mean that my father had a draft of a will before he died?" Qian Ning came to the interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perry considered for a while. go on. "Yes, Mr. Qiu Ke has been entrusted by the master in this respect, but that is only a draft. There is no third party notary public, there is no legal binding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"November 24th eighteen years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Chen Ning crossed the cross on the chest. "Heaven, too coincidentally, my father died at the end of November. He was the one who heard the call of the dead. My poor old father."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to that agreement, you can... Hey, I have said too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please continue, I would like to know, in the mind of my father "What position do you have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, since you insist. Because the person who assisted the teacher at the time was me, so remember some, um... wind spear 40% of the shares of the ship, the house, and the total amount of jewels and bonds worth about 300,000 Caesar belong to the young master." "The old man is the big brother." Qian Ning shouted, "This is almost the majority of the family."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can be assigned to a 4th floor apartment in Dongcheng, as well as three shops in the commercial street and 80,000 Caesar cash." Qian Ning knocked down the table, "Dear My father is not bad to me. If I follow the will, I rely on the rent of the apartment and the shop. Now I can live safely." He then asked strangely, "My sister? You have already said the entire industry of Lu Dajia." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly where I was astonished, according to that will, Miss can only get some clothing and jewelry, the total value is less than 10,000 Caesar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, it seems that my brother-in-law can have today, completely because My father’s illness, I must tell him about it, he should be better for me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I advise you to remain silent.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't know, my brother-in-law is too mean for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should say something I understand." Perry pushed the frame on the bridge of the nose. "But it was stated in advance that my guess was entirely due to the skeptical nature of being a lawyer, not for anyone or for alarm."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qian Ning laughed, "You are too exaggerated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, a few keywords, suddenly died, The person who stays with the patient is precisely the person who has no inheritance right on the will, and the will is not effective. The person is so eager to get there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chen Ning eyes, when he When lawyers understand the hint, chill channeling his Beiji Gu. "You are... no possibility..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that Mr. Mayor often goes to the confessional room of the church, and he is not a believer." Perry said, then stressed, "This is a professional guess, lawyers always love to think from a dark perspective. Hey, you Don't worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can't get the evidence, I have to give you a good meal." Qian Ning stood up angrily. "This is a fall." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you look at this, I have previously found it from the teacher's relics." Perry took a yellow paper from the folder. Qian Ning took over and only felt that his hands were shaking and his mouth was dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I have to leave, advise you to forget today’s conversation, don’t come to me, because a small lawyer doesn’t want to offend the high-ranking city. Long..." Perry also said something, Qian Ning has not remembered. He left the hotel faintly, until the evening, he was lying on the bed, listening to the wind-blown wooden cardboard on the window being blown by the night wind, suddenly shuddered, sat up with the quilt, thinking, "maybe this Sheet of paper is fake, I have to find someone to identify, but if it is genuine, then I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panic in his heart and the fear of the unknown, just like outside the house Cold and biting wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s indeed the teacher’s handwriting." The president of Xiaocheng Law Firm took the will and carefully identified him. He once worked as an intern at Qiuk for a year. There is also a manuscript comparison of the teacher. It is obvious, for example, the turning point of this letter. The teacher is used to taking a pass..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"OK."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chen Ning is holding his head, his eyes are red, his mind is completely occupied by delusions, "That’s not Wrong, I have to tell my sister, no, it may put her at risk. I should go directly to the police station..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This works 16k novel network exclusive text version Starting, no reprint without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You suspect that the mayor is well-known. In order to avoid bankruptcy, really murdered his father-in-law?" Lauvita asked, "For money, people What dirty things can be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, he didn't commit the crime of murder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the mayor always goes to the confession room, and the speculation you make is convincing." Weita didn't understand, "What kind of tricks are you playing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the will is still in the lawyer's file, I feel that he can't "It’s a murderer." Fran explained. "If he murders his father-in-law for money, he must be desperate after learning about the will. And he is crazy. If you are a murderer, it will make such a conspicuous thing." Stay in the world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe he missed this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is home Millions, can be listed as a long-term. Such a smart person, how could not be aware of the obvious loopholes," Fran said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is sure that the previous guess is wrong. The mayor, indeed, could not find the slightest flaw. He has always treated the world with a dark and untrustworthy attitude, but he does not believe that there will be good people. Then, Freire's surname and black crow, let Converse inherit, can accept, at least not tarnished by greedy people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you giving up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, gave up." François Shake his head. "It’s too late to think of it. You shouldn’t give your will to Qianning. But if the mayor’s conscience is innocent, then this will only become a farce, and finally it will improve his reputation.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The identity and proof he once existed in the world will not belong to him. This makes it very desolate to rely on hatred and memories to support the will to live and die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan sneered at the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C&C is unfavorable, Qianning Luda. One of his defeated nephews rushed home angrily one day, dancing a will, let him explain, and everyone said that he had murdered his father-in-law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police chief who came with him apologized apologetically. "Mr. Mayor, because this is a family accusation, you cannot leave the city until the investigation is over. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident caused a sensation in the city, the authorities began to investigate the situation, and the matter of the prince was temporarily stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wife was pale and cried all day. "Agatha, my baby, this can't be true. Maybe your brother is crazy in retaliation and swearing, please believe me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I believe in you, you have definitely not done it, just..." Agatha choked and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chong Lishi believes that his wife is worried about the conflict between her brother and her husband. He also thinks that this matter can be settled as soon as possible, so it is very cooperative. Half a month later, the authorities’ investigators announced that Lao Luda was indeed a natural disease, and they even turned out the report of the coroner that year. After calming down, Qian Ning felt that he was too impulsive. He and the investigators began to look for the lawyer named Perry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All law firms deny the existence of this employee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final investigator concluded that this is likely to be a deliberate framement of a commercial competitor to influence the mayor’s reputation. The clerk was again put on the itinerary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several frequently published public opinion, and Confucius dissident businessmen and politicians, being surrounded by siege, reputation fell, people are sure, definitely one of them , planning a despicable plot. Conris will be re-elected as the mayor for the benefit of the disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is working with investigators, city officials and police chiefs to issue a statement in the city council to end the farce. Just when the members applauded, the old servant of the Charles family rushed in in horror. "Master... Madame she..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agatha Luda died It is. She kindly let the children take a nap, kissed their foreheads, and returned to the bedroom alone, cutting their wrists with a silver-plated tableware knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Converse, my love, let everything be over, don't be sad, I am leaving with the feeling of liberation and atonement, maybe I will go to hell But only pleading, the hell's torture is more severe and cruel." She started the exclusive text version, can not be reproduced without permission, extract, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one o'clock in the morning, the thunder and lightning ensemble from time to time in the dark clouds, and the atmosphere in the study, also suppresses the gloom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bee. When I haven't raised you!" Old Luda muttered, the teacup fell over the table, the tea had drained, "I want to come now." Fighting for the heritage? I will not give you a Caesar, let you help the Charles family's defeated family!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Dad, you are half a father of Confucius, beg you." Agatha cried, his voice hoarse. "I would rather not give me a dime in my will, but now I have to borrow 50,000 Caesar's cash. With this money, he can invest in the sale. This investment will definitely be made." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll! Will only help outsiders, I see Coles, and in this life, he can't make it." Old Luda hated to say that he Waving to let her daughter leave, suddenly. The pain in the chest made him speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad. What's the matter with you? Is the heart uncomfortable?" Agatha looked at his father's face with cold sweat, his expression twisted and painful, his hand clutching his chest. The mouth is sullen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The medicine is in the drawer, give it to me, then call the doctor." Old Luda said intermittently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agatha panicked to the desk and hurriedly pulled the medicine out of the drawer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the medicine and was just about to send it to her father’s mouth and suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cornlock is finished in this life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't invest in people who are doomed to fail "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me such expensive tea bricks? The taste is good, but what does Charles want from me?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should divorce, this father will support you. Let you come back today, is to discuss this matter." "Well, do not want to divorce? You see. This is the will I just made, If you listen to Dad, I will immediately add your share. If you don't listen, take your clothes and cheap jewelry and go to the Charles family to have a hard time."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quickly... Give me, good girl, please." Old Luda realized his daughter's hesitation and begged. Agatha shook very badly. She looked at the father who was struggling with pain, and muttered, "Dad, I love him. I am not afraid of being a poor man, but I can't let his life be so ruined. Dad, I... "After an hour, Agatha palely pushed open the door of the study room and shouted down the servant who had fallen asleep downstairs. "Go to the doctor, dad." He seems to be a heart attacker."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor who came here apologized, "Miss, please be sad, your father has passed away. It is a heart attack. Suddenly, he doesn't even have the strength to take medicine. Otherwise, he can support it for a while." The doctor picked up and sprinkled on the old Luda’s pill at hand is very regrettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estate is divided equally into three, inherited by the three children of Lao Luda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be sad." At the funeral, Conris comforted his wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think Dad is still working, I want to get him a coat to avoid getting cold, if I can go to the exclusive text version first, I can't reprint without consent. , excerpts, more recent and fastest chapters, please visit!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another funeral, many people glimpse, their mayor adults cry in front of the spiritual pivot, "I would rather not have that money in the past, I would rather live with you, as long as you can survive. Lord, let me wake up, this is just a sad dream. "#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People know the tragedy of 18 years ago and accused Agatha of cold-blooded. But no one accused Conris, they all said that the mayor I don’t know, I shouldn’t be implicated in this. How can they spread salt on the wounds of a man who just lost his wife.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mayor’s Pleading, and saying that they would rather not, the sergeant was delayed by the authorities until half a year later. This made people admire Confucius.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I It’s too much. Looking at the hearse under the petals, the coffin was slowly sent to the cemetery, Fran thought, he closed the window, sat on the chair and touched his forehead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You will have trouble with us sooner or later." Kregan whispered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage passed through the crowd and left the town.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the mayor, why do you always go to the confession room? Forget it, people, there are always secrets, even if it is a god, it is impossible to peek into the hearts of the people. "Fran took his thoughts away from his mind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funeral came to an end in sorrow, the earth covered the coffin, and the soul in the coffin. Until this time, Confucius I felt that the cold sweat on my back was dry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, he really thought he was finished and was discovered. He did not expect that the buddy father-in-law actually made a will. The wife stared at him, but the poor Agatha did not know, the gift she brought home, the tea bricks, and the wonderful things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poison that has no odor, is refined by oriental plants, and is like a heart attack. Very easy to use, he now hides a small half bottle in a hidden way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Griffith is too greedy, and actually wants to increase the dividend to 40%. He used the money to bribe the regional bishop so that he could use the Black Cross carriage to unscrupulously deliver high-profit smuggled goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time you trade in the confessional room, you can avoid people’s eyes and ears. But the mayor felt that it was time to stop. The bishop is already under control. And last time, he met a person who pretended to be a god, and maybe someone noticed it and made him more vigilant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money has already earned enough, why should you take risks? Think about it, the philanthropist, Mr. Good, the distinguished mayor, and the status of the Viscount. He can't look down on the little Lord. After half a year, he can get better titles, but he can be stronger than the smuggling smugglers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The remaining poison of the bottle can come in handy again."
