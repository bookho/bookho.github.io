			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. When Lila Berry woke up, it was afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faded red lacquered floor, some leaking, causing a moldy zenith at the corner, azure thin curtains, an alarm clock and a stack on the table Get old books, notes, and newspaper clippings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is her home, six Caesar rent per month, a little more expensive, but with a kitchen and a separate washroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leila twitched the numb neck and remembered what happened before the coma. For a moment, she jumped out of the quilt like a frightened rabbit. The girl found herself wearing only close-fitting underwear. The coat and pants were dry-cleaned and hung on the hooks on the side of the wall against the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fainted... damn profiteer... bed... half naked, Lila was stunned, sitting on the bed, stiff, she took a few deep breaths, tried Calm the panic heart. It was only when she didn't feel anything wrong with her body and no suspicious blood on the sheets. This was a relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but who is taking off her clothes? When she thought of being touched by the dirty hand of the profiteer, the girl was uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the key unlocked came from outside the door, "Who?" Lila shouted, and quickly hid himself behind the quilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms., are you awake?" came in, a middle-aged woman with an apron holding several large bags of food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leila does not know this person, "Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a housekeeper The company's worker, a gentleman hired me and gave me the room key to take care of you until the evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Casimodo Bo Knight? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the name is on the register."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My clothes... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I changed it, is there anything wrong with it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is he doing? On the one hand, letting himself lose his job, on the other hand, he behaves like a gentleman. Lila bit her lip and shrinks into the quilt. Under the ceramic decorations of the bedside table, a piece of paper was pressed, and Li La took it. The above details the activities of the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From start to finish. She was used by people, and she thought that she could become an official reporter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leila is confused, is he misunderstood him? Just picking up this thought, another voice shouted in my heart, don't believe that the more dirty people, the more hypocritical on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waitress of the housekeeping company saw the girl in a daze, shrugging strangely. Put the vegetables and meat into the kitchen. "For half an hour, the food will be good. If you are hungry, I have sausage and ground beef. I can make a sandwich first..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you go back." Lila replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is also one of the services to make dinner for customers according to regulations." The waiter said, "You see, if you go back to the company early, my salary will be corresponding. Reduce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going out soon. Well, if you do it, leave it, maybe I will eat it when I come back." The girl put on her clothes. I don’t want my stomach to be called in protest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what to do. Sitting still will only make you more confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilla Berry is always an action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is not in Tantin City at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is in a sanatorium 20 miles from the city. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sanatorium was built on a gentle slope in the south of the hills, sheltering from the wind, not large, covering an area of ​​about ten acres, with two main buildings and white The wall. The surrounding natural scenery is beautiful and chic, surrounded by large eucalyptus forests, not far from the canal to the capital, the crystal clear canal water, golden light in the evening sunset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, this semi-public welfare sanatorium was for the elderly to spend the rest of their lives. Although the subsidy provided by the authorities is enjoyed every year, the income is not prosperous and has been losing money. The shareholders who cooperate with the government can no longer afford it, and are prepared to transfer the equity that belongs to him, but they have not sold it because of the location problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two weeks ago, Fran used 50,000 Caesars to buy it from shareholders and authorities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become a private industry. Nursing still used the old staff. The only old people who were sent by their families were sent to other large facilities with better facilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only illness here is only Matilda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is my daughter?" Fran asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss is as good as usual, very well." The head nurse replied, this is a very responsible old lady, full of kindness, "I just don't like to talk, However, as a father, you should always come to see her. When drugs can't cure diseases, love can often create miracles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like Ma Tida is so handsome and cute The girl, but with autism, makes the head nurse feel sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as a father, like building a castle for her princess, she will buy a sanatorium for her daughter, who will take care of her full-time job, but every half I only came to see it in the week, which made her feel very irresponsible, but the other party is her own boss, she can only be euphemistically reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will pay attention to what equipment does the office need to purchase now, is there enough people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Because only the lady lives here." The head nurse cautiously did not use the "patient", the words, "the medical equipment is adequate, but the staff is less, now there is a janitor in the yard, three nurses in rotation However, a nurse is ready to resign and will leave when he finishes this month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then hire another one." Fran nodded and passed through The corridor of the courtyard came to the front of the room in Matida. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matida sat at the table with a faint look. Holding a crayons in his hand, he is graffitiing on a piece of paper, drawing no one can understand, messy patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the gloom of the whole house is concentrated on her. The girl is like a white pigeon that is only imprisoned in a cage. Looking at the railing made of iron, she is unable to flap her wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We measure the body temperature for the lady every day, take her for a walk in the yard, and develop foods that are nutritionally compatible."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If," Fran honed the words, "If she gets better, she will notify me immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is of course, yes, Miss likes to paint. I have collected all her paintings. Do you want to see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head nurse left the room and hurried to the office to draw, Fran reappeared, closed the door, he was in the cup full of water Pour a cyan pharmacy, mix well and feed the girl's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paralyzed remedies extracted from plants, such as prisoners, control the girl's brain. This medicine works well, but it is quite short-lived and takes it once every half month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live like a puppet doll, maybe it’s worse than death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slow down." Fran said softly. Matilda slowly raised her hand, took the cup, and obediently drank the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't be pity. Otherwise the Miss Saint Warrior. It will become a raptor." Fran tried to relieve his guilt, in all places. He must do this before the revenge is completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the old lady returns, Fran has completed his visit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going home to watch, there is entertainment at night, I will go first." Fran took the paper bag and looked at the girl who did not respond. Shake his head slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending the boss. The head nurse came to the ward again, came to the hot water, scrubbed her colorful crayon marks on her fingers. "I hope you can get healthy. A good girl like you should have your own life, not stay in bed and sanatorium." Together." The head nurse touched the girl's head and said kindly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matilda looked up and saw her in the pupil without a focal length and continued to silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lila is very depressed, the profiteer actually did not ask for a housekeeper or a domestic helper. She broke her throat outside the house. Did not get any response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was in front of the big iron gate, waiting until dark in the afternoon, and did not see the cycleon Cameron return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This girl is crazy. When she didn't reach her goal, she didn't give up. When she was hungry because she was too hungry, she ran to the roadside booth and bought a piece of cucumber toast. When she was eating and waiting, it was already nine o'clock in the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran was just dismounted, and he saw a shadow in front of the iron gate of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used the light of the streetlight to see the face of the coming person. It is the female reporter named Lila Berry. The woman swallowed half of the food, and then wiped it off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The note you left, I have already seen it. I don't really believe in your rhetoric."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She is very calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan jumped off the horse and looked at her carefully. The cold eyes made Lila feel uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to say this?" Fran said, "No matter what you think, it has nothing to do with me.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you still hate me, then, despite the opportunity to retaliate, if you have this ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opens the iron gate and walks Go in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Retaliation? Why revenge." The girl raised her eyes strangely and shouted behind Fran. "My father said that forgiveness is a virtue, a noble and noble person, smiling at the hardships.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, whether you let me lose my job, or It doesn't matter if the newspaper regards me as a chess piece that I can abandon at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
