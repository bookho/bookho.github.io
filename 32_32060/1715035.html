			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The Duke of Sama Don Reinschmann, the owner of the gorse, the chief speaker of the Imperial Aristocratic House of Lords, Byron’s most powerful authority One, as well, Peggy's father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at the evergreen shrubs outside the French window and said, "This thing will not be the group of pigs of the Emperor Party." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After I was awake, I have analyzed the experience before and after the assassination, but this is not like a precise murder of the plan," Peggy said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This doesn't matter, I am thinking about what benefits I can bring to the family through this matter." Samar said, "The Count of Goldford has already submitted The resignation report, and the new candidate, should be an ally of the gorse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy does not seem to want to continue this topic, she uses her arms to support her body and wants to sit I have to rely more on it, but this action immediately attracted the pain in the wound. She took a sigh of relief, and after a moment, asked in a hurry, "Father, the wedding after January, is it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is best to hold it as usual The Duke of Sama waved his hand and decided to interrupt his daughter. "My father has laid a pavement for you to build a golden and gemstone pile. You just have to follow the arrangements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s follower clerk, calling out the door, “Adult, at two o'clock in the afternoon, you have an appointment to meet with the three members.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Samar grinned and said to Peggy, "Have a good rest, you just have to follow the arrangements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He repeated it again, then walked quickly Go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy squinted and followed his father's back until he disappeared. "Oh, this is my respected father." Her mouth smirked with an unclear smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, even she suspects that in the father’s chest, is it a piece of cold steel? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if his daughter struggled from the death line, he only came to visit for half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the command, no warmth for half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, if an outsider is present, many expressions will be read from the girl’s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irritation, anger, disheartenedness, and more emotions that are difficult to speak in words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind silently drapes the dark-colored curtains, rolls them up and throws them away, and the warm sunlight is sometimes poured into the room, and sometimes it is cut off. Light and shadow. Alternately on Peggy's cold and charming face, gently stroked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran met the Grand Duke in the vestibule of the Golden Rose Palace. At that time, under the leadership of Gong Yi, he just passed through a square surrounded by a colonnade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pavement of the court is entirely covered in white marble, and the decorative buildings such as sundial, aviary, and statues are cleverly placed around the courtyard, and the outermost periphery , is a hedge trim that divides the garden area. In the interval between the hedges, there are colorful flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-aged man with a steady pace. It’s not far away. The arcade of the lead-top wooden pillar passed, and the follower behind the man looked at Fulan. Stepping up, he whispered a few words in the man's ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord Kasimodo Lord Knight." The man came from the mouth of the arcade and greeted him with a certain, not questionable tone. I always wanted to express my gratitude to you. A few days ago, it was you who saved my daughter's life. The Reinschmanns always remember the kindness of their friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This remark made Fran know the identity of the other party. He politely bowed slightly. "Grand Duke. I am honored to meet you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is not a formal occasion, so you don't have to be too cautious.” Sama nodded. “Can you accompany a bored old man and take a walk?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Of course.” Fran answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the court is a flower-filled lawn, irrigation ditch and spray system, subtly concealed under the turf. On a sunny day, every two hours, you can see it. The colorful mist is sprayed out from the leaks on the ground, and the red, blue, purple and purple spots are flashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Knights of the Knights, it is said that the Ingmar existed when the founding of the country, the long history of the surname, although only the Lord's family, but the blood of the noble, like the peerless wine, it takes time to deposit. Those who have established a door for only ten years, even if they have The title of the Count of Viscount is just a nouveau riche."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your compliment." Fran answered faintly and ate a little. shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His forged identity is the distant island country Ingmar, a declining family that lost its heirs a few years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Grand Duke is just as easy as he is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran does not believe that the Duke has any means to cross the space and to investigate in Angmar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you first arrived in Tantin, you would send someone to Ingmar to spend time on the road back and forth for half a year. Never miss a premature discovery of a navigation leak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only explanation is that when the Duke was young, he was studying the compulsory course of each nobility: heraldic, with a study of the aristocratic lineage of foreign countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient aristocracy of Byron, and the branch of the family, nearly four hundred, if you add another country, enough to make people glance at it, they are dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the capacity of Dagong, I will not go to the "Brunch Pedigree" with more than 30 copies for my own sake. For decades, there has been no decline in memory. The master of the gorse, the enthusiasm of Guangqiang’s blog, is worthy of praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember that the badge of the Lord of the Knights is the white orchid on the edge of the green gold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Golden Spike, in Ingmar, only the nobles above the count, have the right to use." Fran sighed. "The Knights of the Knights have only had one count, that is the great-grandfather, green. The bottom of the golden ear, but only in that generation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember the wrong. Hey, age is always the natural enemy of memory." Sama revealed a trace of difficulty The perceived smile, explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan slightly wrinkled his brow, and the Duke was obviously a very vigilant person. The conversation was just out of doubt, but a habitual test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
