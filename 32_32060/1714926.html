			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 244th on the Horseshoe Street is where the Seventh Street Court is located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black roof, slightly old wooden two-story building, the vines circling along the corners, the summer covers the green of most of the walls, There is no such thing in this season, the withered brown and yellow veins make the whole building look bleak, only the sculpture of the just Saint Mutu, who is not very fine in front of the work. Remind that this is a solemn place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is only an ordinary third-class court, it can only be responsible for some small cases, but it is the first step of the Fran career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which day, Fran will enter the aristocratic court and make a fair ruling for even the case that the King’s Highness must pay attention to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first aristocratic court in the new district of Federico City, Fran went to visit, and a trial court there was larger than the entire seventh street court. Can accommodate three hundred people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that there is also a mage who is proficient in spiritual magic in the court of the aristocracy, and can let the most stubborn people tell the truth of the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day, the magician! Fran has never seen such a mysterious person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter in which country, the magician is as rare as an oasis in the desert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a matter of glory to say a few words to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heating in the court was burning, Fran took off his windbreaker, wrapped it in a sheepskin bag and stuffed it into the drawer of his desk, and greeted him a few. After the recorder nodded, he walked toward the office of the court chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s in the bad weather, the wooden boards of the cloisters are beginning to decay, or the excitement is enough. Fran feels like walking on the smooth felt, soft and fluttering. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the first time he went to court as a prosecutor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtmaster, Baron Ross Silva, is a lean, mentally old man. When I saw Fran, I closed the big book in front of me and told him to close the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, Mr. Flair, what do you think of the case you are responsible for?" the court chief asked, pushing the glasses on the bridge of the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the upcoming lawsuit, Fran has been studying for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two young masters who had just drunk in the bar, blocked a young girl in a certain alley, they did every little evil Things, beatings, abuse and violence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s father heard the news and then, even more tragic things happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young masters who were stunned by alcohol slammed the girl’s father until they were stopped by the patrol, when the poor old man had swallowed the last Take a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the surface evidence, this is a very simple case of violent injury, even if the identity of the accused aristocracy, it is difficult to escape the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the aristocratic code, any lower aristocrat leads to the death of a civilian, can only enjoy the right to die, replaced by huge indemnities and long-term hard labor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the key point is: the victim, the girl’s elderly father, is not a pure human being, but a subspecies called the Gothic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Goethes look no different from ordinary people at first glance, usually with small scales in the hidden parts of the body, or slightly protruding bones on the forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the classics of the Church of Light, the first Gothic was the traitor who betrayed the Son, the blood of the traitor was cursed, and his descendants have since Inhuman characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The passage of time, now that the Gothic is not as arbitrarily captured and killed as in the early days, is still regarded as a low-lying class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial law never recognizes non-human races as citizens enjoying rights, this is an iron law that cannot be changed, and the Byron Empire that created this law pioneered : Como I, in the historical data, is known as the stubborn human supreme. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the young masters who are still in detention are proud of it and claim to defend humanity and the dignity of the emperor and never make any compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the huge indemnity prescribed by the Code is an astronomical figure for ordinary aristocratic families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total demise of death is a living life, how to make a reasonable judgment, not only maintains the justice of the law, but also does not despise the face of the royal family. For the judge, it is a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the case was deferred to the third class court after being delayed by the first aristocratic court for a few months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seventh Street Court, which is not qualified for the trial of such cases, has certainly become the lamb for the top tank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Fran believes that he has become one of the Lambs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fledgling rookie prosecutor is a perfect victim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a great guy, but unfortunately, from now on, he will say goodbye to the position of the court. Maybe he can give him more money." The court chief has imagined the ending of Fran. "The prosecutor, I hope that you can be rigorous of your identity, do not make ridiculous behavior in court." He looked at Fran with compassion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Fran nodded in a confident position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that this is a trap, but he also knows that this is a great opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put on the black robe representing the trial and solemnity, wearing a light gray wig woven by the horse, standing in front of the mirror, Fran felt very ecstatic. "The stage has been set up, and my first performance must not be ruined." He secretly prayed as he pushed open the door to the courtroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearing table has been filled with people, many big people have come to this dilapidated place in condescending, the two defendants stood in the dock in disregard, and whispered from time to time. Another lamb in the script: the presiding judge, an old man who is about to retire soon, is sitting in a position of powerlessness and announces in a vague voice, "Calling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; In court, lawyers and prosecutors will always be the fighters in the arena, not to knock down the opponent completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyers of the wicked people questioned the prosecution witness, the girl who lost both chastity and her father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms., do you have Goethe's bloodline?" the lawyer asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s them, they killed my father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please answer me Question, do you have Goethe's lineage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was they who killed my father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The girl twitched and repeated this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All evidence shows that you have one-half of the Goethe lineage, and your father is the standard Goethe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They killed their father!" The girl yelled angrily. The beautiful gray eyes seemed to be spurting fire, and the white teeth biting the lips. "Why don't you blame the murderer, try their crimes, choose a good day for the gallows, but care about the blood of my poor father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Looking at the girl who is out of control, the lawyer smiled with satisfaction, and he gracefully made the gesture of the end of the cross-examination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran did not speak and kept bowing his head on paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer then summoned several witnesses. He confirmed that the victim was a Goethe who was not protected by the Code. The lawyer even shouted. "If my client is guilty, then this absurd court and the person in the room, do you want to ignore the majesty of Como, and challenge the royal honor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fran did not say anything from beginning to end. In the eyes of everyone, the prosecutor had failed. A rookie who was completely banned by a lawyer was destined to become a joke after the judiciary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully said the first sentence until the presiding judge asked if he wanted to find the defendant’s acquittal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "The benevolent St. George VII, the father of today's Holy One, once added a law in the Code: prohibiting the slaughter of any cherished animals." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As everyone knows, the emperor of the previous generation was a monarch who liked painting and poetry. His emotional and artist-like temperament made him love everything in the world. Not only did he have a generous policy of tax reduction and exemption for the people, but he also promulgated various protections. Announcement of endangered animals, in the southern part of the empire, because of the gorgeous hair, the heavenly bird that is suitable for the decoration of the lady's hat, is under the protection of this law, and is re-proliferated by the edge of being killed by the cockroach. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The accused actually despised the emperor's decree and slaughtered the precious Gothic animals. Can you tolerate this crime?" Fran screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noisy court suddenly died, everyone was stunned, and the rookie actually used the animal protection law in criminal cases! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the defendant's statement, the Gothic people belonged to unprotected lower creatures. God, what have you done? Actually raped an animal?" Lan exclaimed exaggeratedly, "Only the pagans can get such a dirty move, the light is on, this will be sent to the firearm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overriding The Church of Light above all kings and lords, the doctrine clearly stipulates that all acts of the beast are prohibited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not uncommon for aristocrats who have lost their titles because they are obsessed with orc slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the audience, invited to attend the auditorate of the Feidu area, devoutly closed his eyes, crossed a cross in the chest, muttered Ramp, "May the sacred fire of 10,000 prisons wash the evils of sinners."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer who fell from hell to heaven suddenly felt that confessing murder seemed to The crimes are much lower than the prosecutors’ allegations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your justice, but I cursed you because you insulted his father’s reputation." Goethe girl was at the court, against Fran That being said, and then kissed the rookie prosecutor, Fran felt a bitter bitterness, it was the girl's tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that the guy can do it, but I didn't expect it to be so good." Baron Robert was full of red light and boasted to the senior prosecutors who were attending. "It's not like a newbie at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first lawsuit in Fran’s life was beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, the shackles were slightly opened, and the faint yellow light from each window of the house, the sound of the children playing at the table, the scolding voice of the adults, intertwined in the alleys of Feidu, let Fran feel some confusion. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charcoal fire in the fireplace is burning, the family is sitting around the table and having a pleasant conversation. The smell of butter and potatoes and fish soup in the kitchen is at the feet. The puppy that was drilled and drilled was eager to move. How long did he not enjoy the atmosphere? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years? Or ten years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of a parent makes his childhood better than anyone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Fran is very anxious about An Mei’s body temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pocket watch is now at 5:00, and it’s still a long time since Anmei finished working. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not that An Mei’s grandmother needs expensive drugs at all times, Fran does not want the little wild cat to stay in the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After knowing Fran, Anmei has never been to a small room with other people, but the drunken drinker does not mind the women passing by. When you are around, knead a hand in their rhyme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait again, the official court officer’s salary is three times more than the trainee. At that time, I can rent a bigger apartment and put her and Grandma is picking up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan thought, reaching out and touching the sheepskin bag at the waist. It is filled with various herbs from the Far East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the hobbies left by his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, his father was almost crazy about the study of herbal medicine. He attempted to combine with alchemy to create a rejuvenating remedy that allowed the wife in the grave to regain his body temperature. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resurrection and the soul belong to the realm of the gods until the end of his life, and this study has not progressed at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in his father’s lab notes, there are several interesting findings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anesthesia soup is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winds and scorpions, these exotic plants in the East, are added to the well water in a certain proportion and boiled into a thick soup, which can make people fall into deep sleep after drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picked patients can sleep well, better than anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This anesthetic soup is also the only savior of An Mei’s grandmother when it is hard to bear. Just because it is expensive, Fran can’t be configured in large quantities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it was earlier than the agreed time, Fran decided to go back and do some treatment on the herbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his father’s research, the wind has to undergo more detailed processing, otherwise it is a poison that is enough to make the liver intestines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran’s apartment is located in the third street of the old district. The old houses that existed when Feidu just started to flourish have long been dilapidated, and the family that has been born has long been moving. Leaving here, the residents living in the old district are small and hard-working staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but compared to the slums of the slums, they have at least their own houses, with the ability to shelter from the wind and rain, at least not in the cold. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the entrance hall, carefully walked up the winding staircase, the 30-pyeong room on the second floor was the home of Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furniture in the room is old, the four-leaf pattern carved on the baroque sideboard at the corner has been worn out to distinguish the original shape, the second-order shelf It shows that this is still the old antiques passed down from the grandfather's hands. Only the viscounts are equipped with second-order sideboards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the oak table has also passed the service life, the boss and the blink of the chassis have long been loose, and started to shake with a little force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the bed is new, but the ceiling is empty and there is no chuang curtain. The expensive fabric is extravagant for Fran. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Fran's research equipment: a delicate small scale, alcohol stove, glass test tubes, filters, tiles for herbal juices The cans, these things cost him most of his savings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Fran stretched out and made a big yawn, he noticed that it was too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following that the little wild cat is still waiting for himself, Fran can't help but feel flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fee in the night is not a safe place, especially the rumor of the midnight butcher, although the news is firmly blocked, but as a civil servant Still heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a madman who specializes in late nights and wants to kill. It is said that there have been many patrol members who have changed their preference for meat because they saw the bodies that were destroyed by the butchers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Fran was frightened by one of his own imaginations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a hurry to put on the coat, Fran ran towards Green Agate Square, and every time Anmei came to the apartment for an overnight stay, he was waiting for him to pick it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the keys to her apartment were given, this habit continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Awaiting the hug of the lover, looking forward to being greeted by him back to the castle, is the natural right of every girl." An Mei always used a smile The green eyes looked at Fran, and the tone was soft as if it had stroked the fine wind of the treetops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon is full of pale light, the cold wind is moving through the winding lanes, making a sound like a weeping, red brick-breaking room in the wind It is particularly quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accumulated water invaded the rubbish scattered in the streets, let Fran fall a few times, near the corner of Green Agate Square, François It slammed into something soft and soft, and then it was the scream that came with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei sat on the floor, her hair was wet, her face was distorted by fear, and there was no blood color. When she saw that she had knocked herself down, she was Fran. At the time, he threw himself into his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Someone has been following me." An Mei pointed to her back, her body was cold and cold, and she kept shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan subconsciously touched the pocket, only a bunch of keys that can be used as weapons, this humble little thing, when held tightly in the palm, let the tip When sticking out from the fingertips, the power is not much worse than a fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
