			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Byron is a ban on slavery, and the era of arbitrary slavery has long passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the orcs of the Black Continent are different. The Constitution is based on the human standpoint. These undeveloped indigenous peoples do not receive any legal support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orc slaves, mainly concentrated in the southern manor, plantation and several veins, the number is not many, it is difficult to arrest is one aspect, and domestication management dozens The cost of an orc is far less than hiring a group of workers at a reasonable price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in the Colosseum in several kingdoms in the west, the demand is larger, but the current world is far less than a few decades ago, thousands of ships headed for The Black Continent, like the gold rush, the slave market in the town, the red fire is getting into the gold, and now, the slave ship is already a declining industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan suspects that the ancient book full of plants should be the product of the wisdom of the Blackland orcs. If you understand it, you may be able to help yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His enemies, all the big men with authority, confrontation, the odds are equivalent to a raw hand, I want to win a few casinos with a few dollars. million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must have more knowledge and use intelligence to make up for the lack of strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are still 170,000." Fran calculated, for ordinary people, it is already a huge sum of money, but the plan for Fran is still Far from enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few hours in the night, about one in the morning, several families appeared on the plains beside the hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran drives the mount to the village, and the man and the horse are very tired. He wants to find a place to stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that very few people have been in the past, except for three simple wooden houses, only a row of gray tile sheds, piled up with several large two-meter-long trunks, not far away The place where the hills are relatively flat is a dense forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This place is probably a temporary camp for lumberjacks, but with the advent of red bricks, the whole wood is largely not as popular as it used to be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night was deep and the plain camp was sleeping peacefully. Fran tied the horse on the pillar of one of the wooden houses. By the way, he looked in through the black lacquered window. He couldn’t see anyone. "Someone?" shouted a few times, soon There was an impatient voice in the other room, "Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shirtless bearded man pulled the door a little, the probe looked over, waited Looking at Fran's dress with his eyes, he asked in confusion, "Are you buying wood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., I want to find a place to stay for one night." Fran Said, "Is there two people living in the same room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, they have to come in a few days." The bearded man touched the short neck. Pulling the door out, probably for convenience, wearing blue canvas pants and rolling the trousers on the knees to reveal the curved legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing to pay five silver coins." Fran 掏 made some change, "I will leave tomorrow night."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course no problem." The bearded man said that he looked at Fran's horse and the suitcase in his hand. "Would you like some wine?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Clear water will be.” Fran is a little thirsty.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the house is not locked, but there is no light, the only bright The source is the moonlight through the two windows in front and behind. There is no bed in the house, just a few dirty canvases in the corner, and a logging tool such as an axe in the other corner.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not yet started this season, so no one is taking care of it. "Beards explained," Or, you go to my room to rest, give fifteen silver coins. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is enough to block the wind. "Fran is not picky.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, good gentleman, like a rough man like me, it doesn't matter where you live. "The big beard squats. "As long as you can live comfortably with fifteen silver coins, I can make a little money." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's alright. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beard's wooden house is almost the same, but the quilt is clean. Fran has drunk the water, took off the coat, and the dark room occasionally came from the woods." The joys of insects, such as lullaby, let Fran's drowsiness and fatigue come up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't sleep well, maybe, from that bizarre experience, he didn't sleep well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a small cup of clear water on the floor. He picks up the drink, puts on his clothes, walks out, wants to feed the horse. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the camp, you can’t see the trace of Los Nantes. In the other two rooms, you can’t find the lumberjack with a big beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Venus is flashing under the black night, watching the time is more than four o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A horse was stolen?" Fran thought, this docile Hummer, even if a stranger rides, will not struggle. Maybe the loggers will see the money. An old horse can also sell a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullan sighed and thought to himself, "I am really a disaster star, even a horse, can't stay long beside me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silent night, the weak voice can pass away, Fran heard, the sound of horseshoes came from the road, he returned to the house, want to see what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four people, the leader is the big beard, they are dismounting in the distance, they come together to discuss what, then, the big beard is handcuffed Take a big axe from a certain room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you asleep?" someone whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He slept soundly when I left." The bearded man replied, "If you are not afraid that he has a small pistol, I will swallow it alone. Dare to go alone. They will be prepared for weapons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much?" Another person asked with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the sound is small. Look at the clothes is a rich man, but also with a small suitcase, maybe there are tens of thousands of pieces."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the lumberjack has something to do with the nearby robbers. Perhaps he is a part of the robber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullan smashed the jacket into a ball and placed it under the quilt, roughly looking at it, like he was still asleep. He picked up the suitcase and turned it out from the back window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was pushed very carefully, the bearded man and two people came in. They looked at each other. One of them nodded, and the big beard picked up the axe and cut it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noise of metal cutting into the wood surprised the robbers. "He ran!" the robber cried, and another robber who blew outside, shouted at the same time. "Here, I saw him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran wants to take advantage of the opportunity to grab a horse to leave, but he accidentally kicked the ground Things, four robbers, quickly caught up with him and surrounded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gentlemen, four thousand, return the horse to me and let me leave." Fran calmly suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearded with a funny smile, "Can you get tens of thousands of pieces, then why do we only have four thousand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Murder, you can send you to the gallows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Someone like this, some people will know?" "Don't be nervous, it won't make you die too hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran didn't wear a jacket, he couldn't see a small pistol at his waist, and his beard had regretted it. This kind of fat sheep, one can do God without knowing it, why bother to find someone to pay for it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big axe for logging, you can smash the skull by just one click, but the robber opened his mouth in surprise, this young man who looks weak and windless, Just lift one arm and block the axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat sheep in the mind of the robbers, throwing the box, sadly said, "Man, when confidence is full, thinking that you can satisfy your greed, but there is no I found that one leg has taken the cliff."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sturdy cloth of the shirt and the trousers, the cockroaches, and then the muscles that are gradually expanding Cracked into pieces of rags, one meter and seven or so tall body, in the blink of an eye, grew into a big man, the appearance is also very different, in the night, the ugly face full of scars, like a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robber was frightened by this situation that transcends reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sizzling liquid dampened their crotch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
