He returned to the management room, bowed his sore back, wiped the sweat on his head with a towel, and the cold winter night was hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately zero in the evening, the noisy day and evening, has disappeared in the wind blowing snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is at least a three-person job." The administrator complained, "Why is it my turn to work in the snowy days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the regulations, he has to stay in the management room all night, every two hours, it is necessary to inspect the internal safety of the cylindrical tower to see if there is no homeless tramp intrusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he heard a subtle voice, very far apart, a bit like the footsteps of the board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember closing the door, but there is always a way to turn the window and lock it." The fat administrator thought depressedly, he picked it up from the corner. The lantern, ignited, and found a charged rod from the bottom of the bed. There is a wooden door on the left side of the management room, leading to a passage of about fifteen steps. At the end of the passage, the bottom of the column is narrow. hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't care how cold the outside wind is, here is the building that is guaranteed by the authorities, go out immediately." The administrator squatted, but took a few steps. I saw the narrow hall in the space where I couldn’t see my fingers. There was a little red light floating in it. He groaned and his heart jerked hard. When the reason told him that it was not a strange sneaky ghost in the story. In the mouth of the cigarette in the mouth, the hot sweat has penetrated the underwear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick darkness makes the administrator completely unable to see the face of the incoming person. He touches the wall and wants to drive the lights in the aisle. The red light falls to the ground. Immediately, the fat man's throat was shackled, and his body was lifted and he had two hundred pounds of body lifted up and his feet off the ground. Hanging in the air, the horse lights swayed and rolled to the corner, and the flames were extinguished after a few rounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, good lord, good sir, what do you see, though, take it." The administrator cried in horror, and the hand on his neck was slightly loose. Loose, he felt that the hand on the skin was cold and cold. There is no human body temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Close your eyes, please believe, it won't hurt." In the darkness, the figure whispered in his ear, and the breath that spit out was also like the cold wind outside the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator rolled his eyes and passed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, scared you." Fran put down the fist that was about to knock the other person out, slowly letting down the fat man with foaming, looking forward Looking up the spiral stairs, I walked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He counts. Stopped at the corner of the 316th step. There is a wall with a black sky and a carved window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently push open the window, Fran takes out the binoculars from the pocket. Looking out to the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lens barrel, there is a room on the fifth floor of the House building that is lit with light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough..." he muttered. "This is exactly the same as the office of the Duke's adult. It is a straight line, and it can be clearly seen in the lens barrel. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use the vulgar point of the rhetoric, the New Year's winter, next to the Dead Sea, occupying the constitutional empire of the Spice Channel Byron, that supreme, let The power of the soul. Just like a charming slut, the face is sturdy and reserved, and the man and the eyebrows are hooked up in the dark, and an unexpected accident breaks the deliberate balance between the lover and begins to become anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who can tell me what happened?" The Duke of Sama Don Reinschmann was as energetic as a lion in estrus. No sleepy, Byron has a tradition of meeting at night. The Grand Duke just attended a meeting at eight o'clock tonight and was preparing to leave the House and heard a news that made him angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tapped the table and stared at a group of cronies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two months ago, I received an anonymous letter with only four words: betrayal...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Punishment..." The Duke said, "For a president of the Presbyterian Church, if there are no political enemies, it would be unbelievable, and I will see too many enemies threatened by boring intimidation. But today, the intimidation on paper has become a reality. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" is the new acting director of the Security Agency. Since Sama’s assassination of his daughter, he took the opportunity to oust the Emperor’s High Defoe’s director. Later, this crone was put on the position of the director. The man was sitting upset and said, "I have not found out which family wants to be detrimental to the noble gorse. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No? Today, I received another note and only wrote three words: I started. At first I didn't pay much attention. Before the end of the meeting, Reinschmann sent an urgent message in the southern news network: Riddle Don Leinschmann, my son, disappeared on the southern road three days ago. The local police only found the body of his bodyguard, and we are in charge of Mr. Strong of the Security Agency, but only say 'no'! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I immediately let the secret police officers of the secret police go to the south to mobilize all resources to find the whereabouts of the son." "Stron is sweating.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big duke’s gray-blue eyes seem to be smearing with substantial anger, he stops and keeps the tone Calm, "But I am wondering why the enemy wants to kidnap Riddle. The children rarely participate in the private house of the family. They can't get any secret from him. Do you want to laugh at Leinschmann? Still want to show your ability to be blackmailed? Please note that finding Riddle is great, but the first task of the Security Agency is to find out who the enemy is and what their purpose is. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please excuse me, there is no family in Byron who is willing to be directly enemies with the Reinschmann family, except..." A confidant frowned, " Except for the one on the throne. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sama meditates while walking around the room, and he walks over to the enclosed balcony with a semi-curved floor-to-ceiling window with a dome. The black hole of the Scorpio, "not like that means, but to be cautious, you still have to pay more attention to the royal family..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words are not finished, Samar body A window on the side, like a cast stone hitting, made a crisp sound, and a spider's web was slightly cracked on the tall glass window.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Shooting?! After a moment of horror, the Duke adults were immediately surrounded by the entourage. But here is the fifth floor, where did the assassin fire the gun?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is panic?" Sama squinted and pushed away. Strode to the window, push open the window, the wind immediately whistling into it, he observed the building around the House building in the darkness of the black charm of the building, and set his eyes on a distant tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only the height of the Emperor's cylindrical tower can allow the assassin to shoot and immediately send someone to check it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sama said, while the dark village. "This distance, even the most advanced assassin's most advanced firearms, can't pose a threat to people, not assassinations, but it is like a provocation and warning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Fran turned and walked downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gun in his arms is the most exquisite private gun in Byron’s underground world, but the effective killing distance is only 70 meters. In addition to the large siege guns, no weapon can block a target hundreds of meters away. Seen from the telescopic tube, the hair was stretched and the glass window did not penetrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And. His shooting method is only pretty good. Even if the gods gave him the magic weapon that could ignore the distance of space, it would be impossible to accurately hit people hundreds of meters away. Fran is a gun that opens to the large floor-to-ceiling windows on the wide balcony. Fortunately, the first bullet has achieved its goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First let the enemies suspicion of each other, throwing into the pond that seems to be dead in the dark, and throwing stones into the shackles." He thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat administrator is still unconscious, and Fran circumvents his body, sweeping the cigarette butt that was intentionally thrown on the ground, through the walkway connecting the management room. Open the door and lift the neckline of the black windbreaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will soon disappear into the shadows of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret police have no clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator of the Emperor Cylindrical Tower was awake, and there was a strange man who attacked him, but did not know what the other person looked like. "The man is very strange, like a ghost." The administrator said, could not help but chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one half of the cigarette butt was found on the scene, suspected to be left by the assassin. But what can this little clue play? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They put their energy on the suspects who came to Tantin in the past few days and still have nothing to gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later, Peggy, who was on a honeymoon trip, got a report. Although people are not in Tantin. But Missy has her own channel to get any news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Through the chemical test, the fingerprints on the cigarette butt and the two threatening letters belong to the same person. We investigated the files of the Justice Department Intelligence Center, but the results were Shocked, this fingerprint is very similar to a death row in which the death row was sentenced to a disciplinary sentence five years ago. The death row is called Igo Andech, a smuggling gangster, but as you know, Fingerprint detection is still part of the exploration experiment, or it may be a misdetection..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Igo Andech?" Peggy pulled with his fingers Buccal hair, "I have seen the head of his knees. Although it has been rotted, why is his fingerprint appearing again?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is down It is worth pondering."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an expert in law, Peggy is very familiar with the origin and development of fingerprint science. This is a judicial circle a few decades ago. The knowledge that the judge has studied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembers a long time ago, there was a debate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think fingerprinting is very creative. It is a genius idea. Imagine if you have a fingerprint file for everyone with a history." As long as they commit crimes again, we can collect the clues collected from the scene and compare them with the samples in the fingerprint database, and immediately discover the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the parliament and The Finance Department will not allocate funds for this kind of conception that stays in the experimental stage. Byron has tens of thousands of prisoners. The fingerprint library is equivalent to a big project, which is time-consuming and laborious, and it is also related to the law provisions. No law can support the passage. Fingerprint conviction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be piloted first. If it is effective, it can be extended to every country, court and police station." said laughingly. "Legal provisions? Since the establishment of the Code, the provisions have been deleted and added many times. If it cannot change with the times, the Code will change from a synonym for justice to a stubborn and rigid stone. The law must be conservative, but it cannot be ignored. New developments."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
