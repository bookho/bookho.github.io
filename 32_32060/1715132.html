			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Peggy and Juliant clamped their knees and tried to huddle their body, half leaning against the wall of the carriage, which is separated from the scorpion by a wall. And the top of the head is a piece of cut salt wet skin, the treatment of coarse salt and sulfuric acid makes these blue-blue semi-finished leathers, which exudes a dull scent of scent, which makes the girls who escaped feel Dizziness and chest tightness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it wasn’t for a few holes in the shelter with a drill, Peggy really wondered if they would suffocate in the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets in the town are not flat, the carriages are constantly bumping and shaking, and Missy uses the faint light of the vents to reach the end of the pain. No sound is heard, and the teeth bite through the lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Insist, it only takes half an hour to get out of town." Peggy clenched the hand of the little maid and said in a very low voice, wanting to talk To divert her attention and relieve pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next step?" The girl’s spirits are languid. “It’s just a matter of time before the big move, the exposure of the whereabouts is just a matter of time. Net."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a hidden boost." Peggy decided to tell her the last reinforcements she relied on. "Kasimodo Berkshire is heading to Portugal." Before the fundraising, I had discussed with him. If he was in a critical situation, he would not return to Hei Swan Castle, but would go directly to the agreed place to wait for me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Lord of the Knights... Honestly, I don’t think I can believe him." Yan Lian warned, "I have been thinking about what went wrong, if not a traitor, the Prince’s army could not It was such a coincidence that we intercepted us. "The carriage was probably crushed to the gravel. A fierce bump was made, and she was so painful that she could breathe a sigh. She took a deep breath and continued. "Think carefully, he knows what you are trying to do." All the plans counted, and just the time to get out of the game, the more I think about me, the more I feel suspicious."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean that Quasimodo is relying on the enemy?" Peggy touched the exquisite care. There is a god in the eye. "If the prince can give him, I can give it, even more generous, why does he betray it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If he is What about the enemy itself?” Julian answered. “Is there something you noticed?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you first met with the nickname of the crow's gangster, the Cavaliers then appeared in front of you, and the second time in the cave kiln trading. He should have been around, but he left in advance, and the girl’s voice was a little trembling. "And, after you handed over part of the command of the film king to him, Joe Coleon’s dragons, After a series of encounters, there was a annihilation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean, is Quasimodo the master behind the scenes? The kidnapper’s head was just a fake before being pushed to the stage. Peggy meditated, "The assumption is true." But I can't think of the reason why he is hostile to me. "Missy Yan Yan smiled. "You may think too much, I believe him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of the Knights is very similar to Fran Fryer, of course. I am not referring to looks. "Jian Li'an said indiscreetly that as the hostess's personal intelligence leader, she knew the story of the past in Feidu. "You are always attracted to such awkward men." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy's face sank. "For me, the dead ghost is just a ignorant monkey, which led to the tragic end of the monkey, and I trust Cassie." Modo has nothing to do with it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little maid ignores the angry expression of the hostess. "I just want to remind you, don't be cheap love." Blind your eyes and relax your alertness. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't fall in love with..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a boot and a collision chamber The sound of the wall interrupted Peggy’s defense, and Xiao Zhi, who was driving, reminded the fugitives that they were close to the police station at the mouth of the town.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master servant Both hold their breath and keep quiet.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please show your ID, where are you going? "The patrolman's inquiry came through the gap between the leather.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a staff member of Lecco Cargo Company and was entrusted to send the goods to Linzhen. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good sir, get off." take inspection. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inspection station has checked the carriage, the consignment of the goods is true and correct, and the driver is also the familiar face of the town. The car to be inspected is on the street. In a long queue, there is no need to delay time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can go." The town police waved and shouted to the same people, "Remove the roadblock and let go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiao Zhi sighed and couldn’t conceal his relief The look, just now he was terrified, and the clothes under his arm were soaked with sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of a road patrol team squatted here, his face was suspicious, his eyes followed and gradually began to accelerate, and he flew along the road toward the town. The truck, he felt that something was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came over and asked, "Who is the carriage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no suspicious situation in the freight forwarding company."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you thoroughly search the carriage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think it's necessary." The town police replied with guilty conscience, the leather full of smelly cars, it was too bad, he would not help the other party to drive away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This group of small policemen who can’t stand the area." The captain of the Mounted Police team secretly said that he finally understood why it was not right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trucks that don’t have heavy weights will drive on the township roads, and the uneven roads will ruin the axles. Every driver with a common sense will try to Slowing down, the other side was too flustered, as if he wanted to leave the police immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ordered, "The riding police team set off and catch up with the carriage in front."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl's mood is like this, there is no wind this night, the sea is not shocked, and there is a boring smell in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautita Whiteman’s arms clasped tightly under the chest, covered with pink lace shawls, draped over the elegant balcony of the master bedroom On the ash, the gray night is tired of the night sky, seems to be lazy to spend free time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is far from being so calm and leisurely on the surface, there are countless rushing undercurrents in her heart, "seduce my man’s goods!" She screamed sourly For the sake of that blind man, Lauvita just had a fight with the head of a long-awaited reunion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hours ago, she was rushing back to the head of the Black King to share dinner, and the girl personally cooked and fried the tender beef with lemon juice. In the drink, she deliberately added the powder of this lamb sedge. The girl has always been very clever in her learning. She also knows some herbal medicines. Hermitage is said to make men more powerful and warlike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The trace of Cecilia has been found, and the little girl is unable to rely on it. I don’t know how to meet with Matilda," said Lauvita, frowning. "There is no use for the orc girl anyway. I don't think They should have more contact with them and have canceled the contact method agreed upon beforehand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can’t wait for her own head, the rest are male, even Madu should be public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to have a head is her three years of luck. This happiness should never be shared with others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t say people like tools." Fran answered, "I have to take care of her in place of Baxin, to ensure that she can grow healthily and accept proper Education, looking for your own life, waiting for the hand, I will go to the samurai girl to break, to return to Cecilia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Want to get rid of Matida?" asked Lauvita. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Fran thought about the crazy face of Chu Jun. He has created enough hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt the exhaustion of the bones, and An Mei’s words echoed in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are constantly denying my present...I am not willing to let myself change...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He is even more afraid, hate and hate is like a very infectious plague, spread out, no one can be spared. From the Julius, Fran looked at his former shadow, and the bloody tears of his former self, so that he suddenly woke up from the black angry nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of Byron’s civil war, the entire empire will become a hell of blood and death, his tragedy. How many innocent people will be repeated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scams, smuggling, murder, war-making, anti-humanity... The sins that have been committed are enough to make him fall into the bottomless hell. But he can bring the world into hell in order to vent his anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe... I really did." Fran thought about his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita stared worriedly at the beloved man, and she was keenly aware. The head is now depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's almost over." Fran tried to cheer up. "Peggy Don Leinschmann is hiding now, but I used the identity of Casimodo and had an appointment with her to meet somewhere. I will use the name of her place to lead the shadow king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joe Corleone and his companions handed me over," Weita asked, "After several encirclements, the prince's army has already made the film king organization a big injury, and there is assistance from An Mei. It is easy to deal with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fran nodded. He didn't need to work. He really needed the girl's cooperation. "But you have to pay attention to your own safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little care Wei Ta is radiant, and the gray-eyed girl hesitates for a moment. The words continue to say, "There is still a problem. If the problem is solved, if Zall Law Longqi and An Mei are solved?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't make this plan." The man replied strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the head a rotten man who is a covenant?" Lauvita said. "When Joe Coleon returns to the West, this alliance is worthless. Zall Law Longchi is deeply hostile to you, and An Mei is under his instigation, I am afraid..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The old dog is scheming, but I don't look at it." And, Fran poured a sip of wine, "An Mei will never be against me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Truthfully said that the woman is a cruel scorpion!" Lauvita snarled in a mean way, she knew that she should not say so, but let the girl lose her thoughts. The ability, "head, reason, she is no longer the lovable girl, she and you are past, you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauvita suddenly slammed her mouth and said that she had revealed her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know who Amran is? Who knows who I am?" Fran’s eyes burned with shock and anger, "You have been private." Investigate my past?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl lifted her chin and looked down at him without fear. "Hey, no, Mr. Fryer Prosecutor, what are you? When do you want to marry me?” Her gray eyes were covered with a mist of water. “I see you as a lover and a lord, but what about you? Is it always a woman in your heart that is not trustworthy? For you to vent the meat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
