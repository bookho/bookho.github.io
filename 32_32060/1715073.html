			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southern Byron, Tyrolean Police Department, a tall, well-dressed, young man with black leather gloves in his left hand is listening to the Secretary’s report His face was exhausted, and a pair of eyes were deep in the blue-gray eye socket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A careful person can detect that the part of the fabric at the glove is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is that young man? Even the director of the bureau is respectful." Agents who passed by, asked the same person in the unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, that’s the father of the Tantin family, the victim of the kidnapping case a few days ago. In short, it’s not the same as our little policemen. The people of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't catch a single person?" Riddle's tone was gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the gangsters seem to have evaporated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ridel sneer, "Human evaporation ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because there is nothing left in the scene that can indicate the identity of the gangster, the Department has inquired about the confession of the original homeowner. The small villa in the suburbs is I sold it two years ago and has never lived. Because it is an anonymous transaction, this line is temporarily unable to catch up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Continue." Riddle The tone of the voice is gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Department also traced the local gangs inside, and the gang guys always got a step faster than us, but this time, they have no clue." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, you didn't find anything at all." He was very angry, a group of slain guys insulted him and made him lack of roots. Finger disability, but the local police said that no valuable clues could be found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still a clue, I have to say that it is not an expert who can’t pay attention to it." The Secretary boasted, "We found it on the carriage in the car outside the car. A small secret room that was cleverly separated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I was put there and bumped for a few days."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole car has been confirmed to have been left by the kidnappers, and it has been cleaned up. But I found a leak from a detail. The axle of the carriage is a high-priced item with a spring, and it is still new compared with other parts. Friction left There are very few traces, and it is obvious that it won’t take long to change.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Does this clue make sense?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "High-priced axles are not ordinary small manufacturers can produce, but big brands that focus on brands often brand their trademarks on the axle wheels. The kidnappers seem to have noticed this, deliberately wearing the trademarks, but they did not expect Sometimes manufacturers will also burn one more inside the axle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We removed the axle. Cut open, the opposite side of the steel pipe, with the trademark of the owl and the number of 011231 The night plaque, the famous big manufacturer, the system is rigorous, the string of six digits represents the date of production and the factory code, so we sent people to the factory overnight. I found out when the axle was sold. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't Huan others guessing. "Riddle's tone clearly impatient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, sir, most of the month before, Pena’s night car accessories store."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Gambling Pena?" Riddle touched his chin and suddenly thought of something. "Specific time, not vaguely half a month ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was nineteen days ago, six o'clock in the afternoon."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Same as he thought. Nineteen days ago, he was proud. Seeing that the big sister who is not pleasing to the eye is on the honeymoon of Pena, because it is the memory of the couple, the official has recorded in detail that the Royal team left the city at 4 o'clock that afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A kidnapping his murderer and leaving Peggy in one after the other, is this just a coincidence? Or they also want to kidnap Wang Hao, but did not succeed? Compared to this speculation, Riddle is more willing to believe that his big sister is in a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you are the first suspect, dear sister." Riddle felt that the broken finger was hurting more. "If it is She wants to retaliate against the shame of being kicked out by the brothers, so I will not be the only victim. The big brother Toman and the third brother Frans are also at risk."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A policeman hurried in, holding a letter in the seal with a red cap. In the official letter between the Byron police station, the green chapter stands for ordinary, yellow for express, and red for red. It is a very urgent event. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director quickly disassembled, swept his eyes, his face changed greatly, he said to Riddle, "Heaven, big event, Lord Toman, your brother I was attacked on the eve of the night, but fortunately the house was tightly guarded and not harmed. We think this is a premeditated terrorist action against all members of Reinschmann, sir, from now on, you have to accept the police station. All-round protection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wound burned so hard that almost Riddle’s handsome face began to distort. “It seems, I have to talk to my brothers. Since some people don’t care about the family, what do we care about?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Peggy didn't know what her brother was planning. Missy was wearing a thick white rubber coat and long rain boots, fanned in front of her nose, trying to dispel the taste of the scorpion's disinfectant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two of Your Highness, please come with me." The dean of the St. Grande Royal Institute said that he took two people through several bullets. The iron gate guarded by the guards, the wall of the corridor is a thick rock block. A few steps away, a monitor appears on the top of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This project belongs directly to the Royal Interior Affairs Bureau. There is no slogan, and no outsider can enter it without permission." The Dean whispered to Julius, "The most I can only stay for half an hour. I have done my best. In fact, you can directly ask your father, the noble emperor, and don’t need to ask me. If you are angry, my loyal and humble servant can’t bear the thunder. Angry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't worry, the father won't know, and the court mages who manage the House of Affairs have privately acquiesced, this is between us. Little secret." Julius smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sealed door opened, and Peggy looked around this wide hall with a magical feeling in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steel instruments, countless red and green pipelines, and a group of people with serious expressions, also wearing white coats, they kept talking in low voice, and they were crystal screens. On the occasional fluctuations in the waves and yelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of everything is in the middle of the hall, on the blue table of half man height, the things covered by huge glass cabinets, sacred objects, artifacts, and many titles that made Peggy think that it would be with mysterious symbols. Look at it and feel extraordinary. But across the cupboard, she only saw it. There were a few brownish yellow, decaying and decaying woods. In the texture of the wood, there is a hint of red and thin stripes of blood vessels, and there is nothing strange about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It can be said that the world's top scientists are brought together. The more you study, the more you discover that these insignificant small pieces have great abilities. The Dean signaled the experiment to begin. A researcher walked over to the console in front of the cupboard and plunged his fingers into the groove. Not far away, three steam engines roared. The cable connected to the glass cabinet starts to be energized, and in an instant, the arc is swaying in the cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy saw that a few pale milky halos appeared around the rotten wood. But only for a very short period of time, the light spots are retired in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time is a voltage of three thousand volts, but the miracle still lasts only a few seconds. There must be more advanced power generation equipment." The researcher explained, He waited for the current to completely disappear and opened the small door of the glass cabinet. Remove a small, transparent tray from the inside with a shackled plaque. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Half-cut, a few seconds. The unexplained power makes it completely recoverable, incredible cell activation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That. Can it work for people? Just like the legend, give mortals immortal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People The structure is too complicated, and the wreckage has limited power to compare the insect's larger body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can only be a bug?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to that note, it really gives people life that cannot be aging, as long as there is more time, we may be able to dig out all of it. The potential."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notes? Can I have a look?" Julius asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My good dear, don't be embarrassed, it's a special secret." The dean wiped his sweat. "But if you are interested, you can visit." The showroom, which is located in the underground waterway of Feidu, was discovered together with the holy things. In fact, there is nothing wrong with it. It is a broken thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julius saw that his wife was concentrating on observing the sacred objects and decided not to bother her. "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The showroom is in the corner of the hall, But the things placed inside, and indeed the same as the dean said, are all broken, with bloody clothes, broken frames, squashed instruments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you collect these useful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the beginning, those bad instruments worked, We cooperated with the contents of the notes, imitating the experimental equipment, and the power is better, the other," the dean did not agree, "if you are not afraid of missing any information, these filthy smashing does not deserve to enter this most authoritative research room."朱 < <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius quickly lost interest, he flipped through the display, ready to leave, just noticed something when he was going out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?" he asked, it was a slightly cyan stone, missing a part, the material was somewhat turquoise, but bleak, lifeless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deadly? Julius inadvertently gave it a personified rhetoric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tested with the instrument, not a gem, no special, probably a piece of blue brick in the sewer, or a button that falls on the instrument." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius holds it and turns in front of his eyes. He seems to feel that the fingers touching the stone are slightly hot, with a hint of not being noticed by others. Flashing, stinging his eyes, the rough stone surface, the texture of the rocks, twisted like a black whirlpool, spinning... rotating... as if to suck him in...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness!" The call of the dean made Julius come back, and he asked slyly, "What about me?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You made a small stay. And, the agreed time is coming soon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I will I remember your generosity this time." Julius patted the dean's shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although there are strict rules, who wouldn’t want to invest in a friendship in the future?" The dean thought with enthusiasm that this formerly outstanding scholar has already More and more like a politician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
