"It's like a monkey." She ignored her beauty and condemned it in a down-to-earth manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Royal Crown Prince, may be able to add a necklace." The court stylist opened the jewel box, looking for the chest chain with clothes in the dazzling pearly glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s already ok.” Peggy said impatiently, "Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The court stylist frustrated and went out. He served the royal family for 20 years, and designed the shape of the marrying lady who had no less than 30 princesses and the Duke's Marquis. Every girl was chosen in a thousand choices. At the last moment, she decided from more than ten kinds of plans. The most desirable, but the prospective emperor, in just two hours, was finalized, as if to marry, is the enemy he wants to frame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a Leinschmann family, you should have sacrificed for Leinschmann, no choice." Her father, categorically Commanded, "I really don't know that you will have such a freak daughter.

It is not certain that she will smash her fist into the mirror and crush the beautiful but stiff figure in the mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't need to make any changes, the clothes are in this style." She thought it was the stylist who came again, said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leinschmann, no, Miss Peggy." The man said in a weak voice, "You are beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head and looked at the face pale. But there was a gleaming boy in the pupil. This was the little husband who was forced to her by the family and the royal family. The first heir of the empire, the prince of Julius von Como, who was just twenty years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of age, he is no longer a boy, but he has lived in the deep palace for a long time, making this young man's personality as soft as pure. However, for an elderly woman who is six years old to become her own wife, Julius has no objection, the gentle sister of the elder sister, looking at Peggy's expression. It seems to be the most fanatic art lover. Shaking and admiring a famous painting that is unique in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy has no interest in this man, she tried not to let herself show an annoying expression, with both hands slightly on both sides of the skirt. "His Royal Highness, visiting a fiancée before the wedding is not in accordance with etiquette."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you hate me?" Julius was sensitively aware of the tone. Indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, hey, you said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Peggy, I swear, will become The most perfect man in your heart, I will give you this world." The boy said excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Peggy answered quietly. The whole world? If I want it, I will take it with my own hand. she thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the wedding, there are still three months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diplomatic officials of the countries, the cardinal of Anno, the aristocrats of Byron, and the invited artists, come to the ceremony to add lustre to the artists and troupes. Tanding is gathering in succession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And officially issued wedding notices to the national public, in these few days, things have been fixed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day, even every minute of the clock’s hands will make Peggy feel extremely annoyed, she sends away her future husband, pushes open the window, hope Under the sun, Zhuang Muqimei. Let the Crown Prince kneel down to the East Palace Manor before the wedding. I can't wait for a meteorite to fall from the sky and destroy everything in front of me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father... No matter how hard I try, in your mind, there are props that can be traded." Her lips are white. "So, I no longer regard the family as a worthy service.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From today, the gorse’s return to the gorse, Peggy’s, to Peggy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This The 16k novel network exclusive text version of the first work, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team traveled to the bustling provincial road and took two days to reach the destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flane Freire's singular looks are very eye-catching in the troupe, "The main investor of the Cardinal Star Grand Theatre, Lord Ingmar United States, The millionaire who is looking for a new investment project is his open identity. Of course, the secret lover of the leader, Barry Silana, is also spread inside the theater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole swears that she only hinted at it when she was asked by the curious actors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there was a lunch, and several employees were gathering at the table to talk about it, and the head of the passing group heard it. She just said in an understatement," You should use your energy in a more meaningful place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then everyone saw, the head of Baru was sitting alone in the corner, picking with a fork Bolognese noodles, stealing music, is completely a small woman in love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rumors, Fran kept the city silent, and he was busy calling Cecilia to translate the plant book of the orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen this word, but I don’t know how to read it." Cecilia said that this 12-year-old orc girl is very cute and furry. The ears and tail, as well as the small face of pink rose color, let everyone in the troupe love her, and as long as a pack of zero mouth, you can let Cecilia treat you as the closest person in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullan broke up the text in the book and let Cecilia translate it one by one. Many words she didn’t know, but the words translated in messy The phrase has already made Fran a deeper understanding of the plant book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The lab must be moved over and it is too much trouble to re-purchase the instrument." He thought, "Don't you tell Lavetta? No, try not to get her in." ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in the whole troupe often see, lazy afternoon, on the comfortable cushion of the open carriage, the strong man with a pen, writing symbols and equations that no one can understand, and then holding the chin into meditation, and wearing Princess dress, like a doll, Cecilia, like a kitten, lying on his knees yawning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Cecilia, do you still have family?" Sometimes Fran would ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have an uncle, but I haven't seen him for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He called What, I am going to help you find it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big man, don't look for it!" Cecilia spit her tongue and learned Nicole to Fran The name, "He always told me to do this, but it is still comfortable here. There are always sisters who feed me deliciously."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at pets The self-reported girl, Fran is laughing and laughing, he did not ask again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia stunned in the arms of Fulan, her head buried, the round yellow-brown pupil was unknown, became fine Narrow slits. Through the clothes, through the skin muscles, through the most subtle fibers, cells, fascinated gazing at Fran, only with the special talent of Cecilia can be perceived, something that is growing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It must be delicious when you eat it." The girl was like a pouting child who saw a delicious cream puff. She swallowed her throat and swallowed it. I knocked my head again with a small fist. "The big man will turn into a stone. I don't like him to be a stone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instinct of reason, feelings and foraging To make Cecilia very contradictory, and finally she finally convinced herself, "It looks unfamiliar, wait for it to grow up again..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She Like a little beast guarding food, he stayed with the big man all day. Whoever accidentally touched Fran, the girl raised her nails fiercely and made a "beep" warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One big one is really good." Everyone said so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barry often smiles at this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole secretly asked, "Are you jealous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say, how can I eat the little girl's vinegar?" The head of the team confidently stood up. "I like Cecilia very much, maybe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She is happy to imagine, maybe in the near future, she can adopt the orc girl, then find Ma Tida, and the loved one, to form a family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the night and the shackle alternated twice, the majestic Tantin was in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are three more days, transfer to the two buses, and you will be in the capital."

The waiter at the restaurant in the station asked with a pen and paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zall method shook his head in distress, hey, I was only in my early forties, and I was called the old gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just ordered some chicken and rape, and then heard a wave of boiling outside the station. Zolfa looked strangely and saw two black cross-drawn carriages escorted by the Knights of the Church, passing the avenue and slowly passing through the station. The vehicles on the road moved to the roadside, and people looked at the sacred team with respectful eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anno's Cardinal." Drow, muttering, he turned his attention to the forefront of the team, a girl in a religious dress is solemnly Heads up, a flag on the saddle depicting a bloody cross pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drow method thought about it, this should be the "Sorrowful Cross Knights" of the Church of the Holy See, and he heard that the head of the Church Knights was Pure and innocent mad girl, I think the lady is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a picture touched the nerves of Zall Law, he slowly turned his head and looked at the hand that was stretching his palm, boring and playing with his finger . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on her face that day was too similar to the maddening girl she saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is the grandfather of Anno appear here."
