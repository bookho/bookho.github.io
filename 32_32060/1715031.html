			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.For the secular strategy, Fran can be prepared and used wisely, but it is impossible to prevent supernatural things. He asked with concern. "Does he know my secret?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can it be if I didn't use mind reading and saw your memory? I will believe that there will be such bizarre and irritating encounters in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What purpose does he have?"<br /><br />&nbsp "Curious, this is the nature that the Masters are indelible." William squeezed his eyes. "Please rest assured, of course I will help you hide the facts. A Master apprentice, with an arcane atmosphere, owns A few pieces of magical equipment are naturally the most reasonable explanations, and can also dispel his boring curiosity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran immediately understood the intention of William, "I am that The teacher is an apprentice from the Wilhelm Master?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also a fact, have you forgotten the alchemy experiments we have participated in together?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran’s warm heart, the acquaintance of the teacher and the friend, always appears at the most critical juncture. Be generous to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the way of the monster, escaped from the sewer and sought to return to the secular society, he devoted all his energy to facelifting himself and created Convert the shape of the ring. Now, it is him, avoiding his own identity in front of the omnipotent Austrian law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds the wine cellar and walks back and forth in the hall to measure the matter and bring his own advantages and disadvantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After half a quarter of an hour, Fran made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the mage who was in the face of the greedy cup and asked, "Can you help me meet with Master Barry Roche?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem, I am going to get back the fine gold. However, there is no need to see him, so as not to be suspected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, since it has been discovered, it is calm." Fran poured half a glass of wine into his mouth, feeling the spicy liquid and swaying through the throat. “Just I can sell my personal love to the royal family and the Reinschmann family, and let a person survive.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the storm of Judgment Day, the arrogant gorse must continue to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shengde Charity Hospital, built in a double-storey old mansion in the period of Como IV, with a small circle surrounded by wooden fences in front of the door Courtyard, yellow-green shrubs and flowers. A white cobblestone paved two-person wide path leading directly to the third-level stone steps of the main entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steps are painted in red, blue and white. This is a tradition born of modern medical concepts. Red represents arteries, blue represents veins, white It represents a bandage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ancient times, when the magic was in its golden age, people relied on the Holy See’s priests to save the wounded, but the gift of the Father’s gift gradually declined. In the nearly century, drugs, first aid, and surgical anatomy still in the groping phase have become health guardians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior of the hospital is an all-wood structure. The entire first floor was completely opened into a spacious hall. Two rows of one-piece chairs that can accommodate ten people at the same time, placed face-to-face on the wall so that the patient can sit on the waiting for the doctor's treatment. The old wooden window frame has just been sprayed with varnish, and the general glass window is also brightly wiped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor is divided into six small single rooms, which provide serious problems for those who need to stay in hospital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the stair wall between the two floors, there is an oath in every hospital: "Practice with dignity and dignity, in the eyes of the practitioner Only duties and patients, without any religion, nationality, race, political opinion or status."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a cheaper fee. The simple clinic for ordinary citizens is crowded with famous people. The indoor air is bred with a tense and depressed atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crown Prince Julius is being attacked by sorrow. He couldn't be seated for half a second, and sometimes he was like a wrathful lion. He looked at everything and was not pleasing to the eye. He accused the hospital's rudeness and sometimes the officials on the corridor. I think their embarrassment has affected the doctor's treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after a while, he leaned against the wall halfway, whispering, and being almost mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since half an hour ago, a manager of the inner court, to comfort his highness should calm his emotions, he was pushed to the ground, no one dared to dare after the dismissal on the spot. Go to the mold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene clearly obscures the secrets of the cabinet ministers and the great-named Marquis of the great emperor. After all, the treasure of a country, even in the most critical moments, should show enough calm and majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being one step away from the throne, you should always put the actual interests before the weak sensibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy’s situation is very dangerous. The assassin’s dagger caused a lot of internal bleeding, and the organs began to succumb to varying degrees, and the poison on the weapon was It was found to be a juice extracted from the moon vines. The toxicity is fierce and fierce. Because the toxins have entered the blood circulation, the neutralizing and toxic antidote will not work. Doctors can't use bloodletting therapy to discharge all the deadly substances. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the only hope is that the Archbishop of Roland, who came to the wedding of Annano, will participate in the wedding ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a squeaking noise from the stairs, Julius first greeted the past, but the bishop, who is known to be proficient in healing the gods, looks gray Desperate, exhausted, and supported by the entourage, slowly walked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bishop, hope is good news." The crown prince seemed to feel unfortunate, and his voice trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continuously applied four treatments to stabilize the situation." Roland's words immediately caused a relief like relief, but the subsequent words, Let the atmosphere return to silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness is only temporarily safe, still in a dangerous period. If it is a simple internal bleeding or poisoning, it is easy to do, but the two are combined, just... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just need to say, if we can't find a better treatment, how long can she live?" Julius instead Restoring calm, he interrupted the words of the bishop and said calmly. But the uneasy light in his eyes revealed that he was just reluctantly supporting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Up to six hours, the magic of suppressing the injury will be ineffective," Roland replied. The so-called proficient treatment of the gods is only a simple means of propaganda. After all, the image of a saint who saves the wounded is more conducive to attracting believers. He is only good at the magic of the discipline, and he has applied a few times of minor treatments, and he has no choice but to deal with serious injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
