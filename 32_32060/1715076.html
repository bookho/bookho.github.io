			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. In the face of the power of absolute superiority, the brain is a bad idea, it is a trick for children to laugh and laugh, you are a waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cut, you are just a beast that plays with supernatural powers." Lauvita thought with hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fled with the orc girl, but the horse tied to the forest, because of the pressure brought by the battle, scared to the ground, regardless of How the girl commanded the whipping, they could not move a step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No way, Lauvita can only walk with the unconscious Cecilia, because to keep secrets, the camp with the gang gunners agreed to meet The hilly wilderness, with a small half-day riding distance from the main road, if you rely on your legs, you have to spend a whole day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several times, Lauvita wanted to throw away Cecilia to speed up, but she still tolerated it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mitida has been abandoned. To complete the follow-up plan, there must be a new tool. This orc girl is very simple and can be used by me. For a moment of stability, it will be difficult to make a move in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only two hours, I was physically and mentally arrogant, and also took a half-big girl to wander in the rain. The tower was really unable to move. She panted and stopped by a stream, and found a cave that was not too deep, and the hole was covered with grass and vines, which could hide the entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, dry food and spare weapons are left behind. I just wanted to escape and didn't hold it." Rained and wet. Uncomfortable, physical exertion is too much, and the stomach does not know the time to call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twice, the task entrusted to me was disrupted twice by you, and I was forced to be embarrassed, okay, I will play with you. In the end, if you don't die, sooner or later, you will seriously threaten your head's safety." Lauvita thought about it, while checking the wound on Cecilia's shoulder, it was deep and the skin was fleshy. But no more bleeding. She stuck it on her chest and heard a heartbeat and let out a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to deal with the injury under treatment, otherwise it is still life-threatening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignition when fleeing is undoubtedly an irrational act, and Lauvita hesitated and repeatedly reported the gambling mentality and walked out of the cave. I picked up a few broken branches that were still dry. Fortunately, the lighter was carried with me. She lit the branches, and a thick smoke made the girl tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took off her open linen shirt, wearing only a small sling, squatting on the side of the fire, drying the clothes, then tearing it into pieces of cloth and wrapping the wounds of Cecilia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia’s breathing is very gentle, and the orc girl’s vitality is only a small beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you wait in the dark, you will have no weapons and no food. The longer you are in the wilderness, the less secure you are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is hanging in the sky. At about noon, the grass in the hole was suddenly opened, and there was a snoring from the throat. Two cold spots are particularly distinct in the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautta was shocked and habitually touched. "Damn, the gun has been thrown away." She touched a stone from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gray-brown beast that looks like a cat but is a lot bigger than a cat, and half of the body is coming in. It’s a cockroach, the tip of the ear is full. Black tufts, coix seed is a long, slender slit, which should be just returned from a full meal. There was a lot of blood on the cheeks. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously this is a nest of scorpions, seeing someone invading the private territory, it opened its mouth, revealing sharp teeth, and making a low-pitched demonstration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire makes it very fearful, does not dare to be closer, but does not want to leave, has been lingering in the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, if there is a gun. Ten are not afraid." Lauvita has a feeling of heroic shortness, this can command a large gangster hundred A gunman, a woman who was conspired with a conspiracy scam, is now blocked by a big cat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many dead branches, and the fire is slowly dimming. The big cat puts his head in and stares at it, as if waiting for the glow. Once the thing is extinguished, it will immediately be divided into the enemy who occupies its nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call and scream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice came from behind Lavetta and took her Scared in my heart, I don’t know when Cecilia woke up like a big cat, leaning forward, two small ears erected, her mouth wide open, revealing a pair of small tiger teeth, yellow-brown The eyelids also shone with wild light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Food..." She seemed to be still squatting, completely treating herself as a bloody animal, and was greedily looking at the pile of meat in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Checked and sighed and slammed out quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hungry." Cecilia murmured, and turned her eyes to Lauvita, his nose flapping, "good fragrance, the taste of the dragon veins." "She is hungry and hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was just about to rush over, and when she was moving, she fell to the ground, and the wound was pulled back again. The severe pain finally made the girl wake up. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked around, her eyes getting wet, and then she became crying. "What about Aunt Barrie? What about Mateda? How is this?" The less mature woman is, oh, Cecilia is sore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These dragons of these kings are all difficult to use common sense. Understanding the freak." Lauvita touched her forehead with a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain that lasted for a day gradually disappeared at dusk, and there was still a damp and scent in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A good fight!" Looked at the traces of the forest that had been blown by a tornado, especially the divide that almost turned the entire land, Lloyd The tower feels that the back is cold and the high-level supernaturals fight, which is not what she can just imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the courage to go back to the woodland with the Shadow King assassin with Cecilia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita wants to know the outcome of the battle, especially the samurai who was released from the ban, she must figure out the other's life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, because of her mistakes, at the crucial moment, another enemy was added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The best two are the same." She looked forward to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc hoe squatted on the ground, like a puppy, sniffing and sniffing, looking for traces of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the smelly monster, she’s actually hurt, hey, it’s disgusting.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Oh, hey, the other beach blood is mine, Cecilia is so poor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the ground in the east On the first, I found a sloppy blood trail that stretched out of the forest. She touched her finger a little, and stretched out the pink tip of the tongue, screaming and crying and laughing. "These blood is Matilda's sister! She Still alive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst situation, both lose. But none of them died. Lauvita tried to ask, can she find her? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia shook her head. "There are leaves blocking, the rain is small, the blood has not been completely washed away, but out of the forest, I am at all Can't smell it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, no one is now." I can't search for the whereabouts, and I really find the holy warrior, and the orc girl won't help me. Lauttata thought, "It takes at least a week to relocate the two teams of gunmen. I hope it will be too late. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mount did not run away, it seems to have recovered its spirit, eating the tender grass on its lips, sneezing from time to time, shaking the residual water on the fur Stains.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita is hanging from the saddle next to the saddle. Find the spare pistol. Check the lower clip and take out the dry food and dried meat. And Cecilia divides. The two people who are hungry and have their backs have finally given their stomach some comfort.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This whole day is a bitter Experience, let her and Cecilia's friendship is much deeper, at least the little girl saw her, no longer shouting "unfamiliar woman" but "Laugha sister".<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I seem to have forgotten who. Lauretta thought about it, she looked at the orc girl, and the other person, just looking at it in confusion, the two looked at each other for a moment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 seconds Afterwards, Cecilia cried again. "I... I forgot to give you an aunt!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barui Sirana is lying in a bush, and a large secluded deciduous branch covers her and only reveals her nose.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia had to hide the head of the team in order to save Matilda.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The narcotics that fell into a coma made her awake until now.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the dose, I will sleep for a long time." The gray-eyed girl looked at Barry in a complicated way, and wanted to immediately take out the knife. The sleeping beauty can make men sin on the face. A few knives came, but the orc girl next to her let her dispel this impulsive idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After freezing in the rain for a day, it is best to let you have a cold and die." Lauvita bites her lip and then makes a serious expression, she bends down Looking straight at Cecilia's wet scorpion, "Do you know that it is because of your sake that Miss Silana is in danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said in an unquestionable tone, "If you are still in the Cardinals, then all the sisters in the theater will be hurt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work 16k novel network The exclusive text version of the first release, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpts, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this wilderness ridge without large carnivores, it is undoubtedly the top beast of the food chain, supreme predators, marmots, wild birds, frogs and Snakes are frequent visitors to their recipes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not long ago, the king of the hilly land suffered a severe blow and was driven out of the nest by two creatures that had never been seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the nerves run around, every time there is a small animal rushing to avoid the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep, it stops by the stream, with a stabbing tongue, licking the clear water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a faint bloody sputum in the air. I stopped drinking and felt hungry. It followed the wonderful smell and followed the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing, on a flat rock by the stream, there is a strange animal lying on its back, his hands hanging down in the water, not moving move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the kind of animal that arbitrarily occupies its nest! Roaring, screaming in the distance with vigilance, the smell of blood tempts it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instinctual appetite finally surpassed fear, it carefully approached, smelled, it should be a body that has not decayed, a perfect big meat , can enjoy a few days comfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slender hand suddenly lifted up, so fast that it was too late to react, and it was smothered by the throat. The sharp claws kept tearing and grabbed deep scratches on the arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medida Hepburn gasped, this beautiful girl’s clothes were bruised and bruised, and the white-gold hair was already stained by muddy moss, she was stunned. Looking at the prey in his hand, he could not feel the pain at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Live." There is only this thought in her mind, the strength of the fingers is getting stronger and stronger, and the side is pumping, with the smashing of the throat, The body collapsed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly scraped it, biting the throat of the prey, drinking hot blood, it was full of smelly liquid, so that Ma Dida did not drink a few Mouth, you have to hold back nausea and vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is covered in blood, under the moonlight, next to the stream, and keeps coming to make the little beasts swallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood makes the emptiness of the gastrointestinal seem to be better, the former solemn samurai head, the most beautiful flower of Anno, now the wolf is falling to the extreme, Marty Dad panted, and the stench of blood from the chest and abdomen to the mouth made her look like a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the stream, and the surface of the water vaguely reflected a pale face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hates the shadow of the water and hates her own defiled body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a heresy monster, ** hug, or take the initiative. Perhaps it is an embarrassing experience for ordinary people, but for the mad believers, this is an unforgivable, sinful crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their ethical outlook is not only for others, but also for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also assistance in heresy and the killing of extermination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is because of a brain injury, it is imprisoned by evil heresy, but the sin that has been committed, the blood that has been stained, can no longer be cleaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lust, help the enemy, recognize the heresy as a pro, Matidda wants to let himself go to the fire on the shelf to die ten times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
