			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Before Fran Fryer began his plan, let us briefly explain the ancient smuggling, the first customs established from the world, Since the first commercial tax order was promulgated, it was born, just like the swaying silk attached to the ramie, with countless thin stems, firmly entangled the host, and did not separate from death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax police and the smuggling team are their natural enemies, and the broad ocean is their sanctuary, a flying fish-like sloop, In the night and the fog, the waves rushed across the waves, and the warehouse was filled with heavy boxes, including Ingmar's wool, Portuguese-style nylon cloth, Russian large-volume smoke and spirits, familiar to smugglers. The most remote waterway, know how to drive through the reef-filled waters, to open up the deeper naval warships, knowing which deserted islands along the way will allow them to temporarily renovate for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has inextricably linked with all walks of life and all walks of life. Very early on, smuggling was just a spontaneous practice of the hard-working man. Today, this is already an extremely lucrative underground industry. Prohibited goods that are absolutely not available in the market, foreign goods that are in need of the black market, goods that do not have to pay taxes to make the cost cheaper, and a large number of illegal goods, starting from the port of Regina in Portugal or the Kuroshio Bay in Russia, The far-sea sea avoids the prying eyes of natural enemies. There are many replenishment stations on the way that only provide clear water and food. They sneak into Byron, and then flow into the inland from the freshwater ports such as Weber Harbour, and more to the capital. That city is simply the best dumping ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the goods have not arrived, the action on the other hand has already begun, and the price and delivery location are negotiated with the buyer, and the ordinary ones can be circulated in the market. The goods are ready for forged immigration tax permits and permits. This is no longer a simple, original business, it has private sales channels, a huge network of contacts, procurement - transportation - licensing - sales and other aspects. Operate the network, as long as there is no mistake on the way. When the smuggled goods arrive at the destination, they are either hidden in the dark, or they are transformed into labels and become the most impeccable formal goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About smugglers, there are a lot of anecdotes about them in the world, such as a little story: the tax police suspected a businessman who often goes in and out of customs, is doing smuggling Activities. But every search has nothing to gain, every cargo in the ship's warehouse, even a salted fish, has a reasonable source and reliable guarantee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone knows that he is suspicious, but we just can't find anything." The tax police complained to the boss, "Every inch of the deck on the ship has been checked. Innocent is like a **."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time later, the trafficker revealed the secret to the intimate people after a drunkenness. "The speedboats of the Byron Shipyard are in short supply in the Portuguese. The Portuguese double-bottomed sailing boat also has a market in Byron. Heavy tariffs, ha, the group of fools stepped on the smuggled goods but did not know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The smuggler is the ship itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not check how reasonable this folk anecdote is. But everyone who hears the story will laugh at the incompetence of the customs and cheer for the smart traffickers who use the tricks to play the tax police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the violent pirates who hang the flag, the dirty shackles are hand-made, and the smugglers are in the eyes of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have to say seriously that they are not robbery robbing the rich and poor of the sea Robin Hood, nor are they fighting for the interests of the civilians. This is a disorderly order, breaking the rules. Black heart gangster. They are doing everything, murder, fraud, sales, money laundering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hay City is a gateway to the bustling city, the fee is all spices The entrance to the waterway is in the west. Then, it is the exit of the Golden Bay to the inland. The wealthy wholesalers, the fleet of transported goods, the well-dressed gentlemen, the gangsters, the swindlers and the prostitutes, the people of the three streams are coming incessantly. The whole society's profitability. It is particularly obvious here. It is like a big store with a bright decoration. As long as you have money, you can have the heart of the most beautiful woman, buy the promise of the most authoritative big man, enjoy the life like a princely, here is the belt. There are also small hotels with the characteristics of the museum, as well as high-end tasteful hotels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tantin, as well as residents of some great cities, always laugh at the nouveau riche city like Haid, and can’t deny the truly elegant upper class, but it can’t be denied. , there is indeed a place where all the ** can be satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff of the Bailu Salon Hotel have a good eye for everyone, who is a wealthy middle class, and who is absolutely different, they are clear at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this morning, when a group of new guests arrived, the lobby manager knew that there was a big Hawker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are six bodyguards in black suits and strong body. They immediately dispersed to occupy a favorable position and watched the surrounding situation with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a steady-stricken young man came in. His hair was coated with a layer of scent, a refined oriental spice, an extremely expensive hair oil, and a half-length dark brown hair neatly combed back. The hairline of the forehead, wearing a black brand-name hand-made windbreaker, the face is well-defined, the lips are very thin, looks like a kind of insincere and picky, the light black eyes are not light, it seems deep and inspiring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first the lobby manager thought that he was the heir to a big chaebol, the male son born with the golden key, but with a little contact, he immediately changed the guess, this The lord with the entourage and the personal secretary is obviously more honorable. It is a real aristocrat with a long lineage and high education. The middle class does not have their heroic spirit and ostentation. The earthen buns do not have the style of everything. "Hello, Can I help you?" the manager asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the man was calmly observing the furnishings and decor in the hall, and he nodded in satisfaction for a long time. His entourage, one may also work part-time at the same time. The beautiful lady with the gray eyes of the secretary and the lover, immediately said to the manager, "My master is ready to pack the entire top floor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please wait, let me check The checklist." The manager said that he went to the front desk and quickly flipped through the register for a while and replied in a distressed manner, "Sorry, the top floor has already been accommodated by several guests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Grey-eye girl turned her head and leaned into the owner's ear, whispering to the manager's reply, the distinguished guest touched her lips with her fingers, and ordered a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The owner said that if those gentlemen or ladies can give up the room, he is willing to repay generously. Of course, this is not disgusting or arrogant. It is really the owner's favorite. Quiet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager is very puzzled. It is obvious that it is more convenient to talk directly. It is necessary to confuse the communication through several people's mouths. "Which is not? Foreign aristocrats who understand Byron, no, in appearance, may be young chiefs with several gold mines in the East." He thought and continued. "I can try, but I can't guarantee it, and I don't know what conditions you can use to convince them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bulging lambskin bag handed In the hands of the manager, the mouth of the bag is tied with a string of gold wire. At the end of the knot, a flawless emerald is hung. The manager does not know what is inside, but the value of the bag. This will allow the pedestrian to pack the top floor for a whole month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are quite a few precious jade and diamonds inside. The owner told me. Everyone who is willing to let out the room can pick one at will, as compensation for the apology." Miss follower signaled the other party to open the bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not bad? For a moment. The manager was almost stabbed in the bag by the flashy glitz, and he was dizzy. He shook his hand with a wet wipe and carefully pinched one with his fingers. Even if there was no professional lens to distinguish the authenticity, he also To be sure, even the cheapest diamond in the bag is worth at least 7,000 Caesar in the market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of shot is not generous, it is simply profligate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I don't think anyone will reject this gift," he murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no one will be tempted by these crystal clear little things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was vacated at the same time. Rumors of an unusually rich prince have quietly spread throughout the White House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the top floor, living in a jeweler's wife, she gave up the room and chose a beautiful emerald, according to her Husband identification, can sell nine thousand pieces, if the silver chain and gold ornaments are set, the price can be increased."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did I not encounter this? Good thing?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This act is like a nouveau riche.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said, when the outbreak reaches a certain level, it becomes gorgeous and elegant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe two days, no, maybe only one night, this thing It will become a hot topic in the rich circles of Hyde City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lobby manager said privately to his peers, "The identity of the person is definitely unusual. I started thinking that he would not speak the native language, so he only let the servant and I spoke, but later I found out that although his accent was a bit exotic, it was definitely a smooth Byron. He was disdainful to talk to people in the lower class personally! Oh, although I feel insulted, but actually I Envious, oh, this is the fucking arrogance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
