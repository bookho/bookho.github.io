Fran deliberately made him lose more when he was playing cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The hour of the meal, take a break, continue in the afternoon." Fran suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also. But beforehand, if you have a boat, no matter how much I win, I have to go immediately." Igo Andrhe stood up with satisfaction. Go to the hotel restaurant. "My luck is getting better and better, it is a good sign." He thought excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How much have you lost?" Fran saw Andrei go far and asked the Navy captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the morning, I lost 7,000." The captain sat in the chair and had no appetite. "It seems that I can't play in the afternoon, hey, here. On a boring island, playing cards is the only fun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can a person be so lucky?" Fran hinted, "I lost 5,000." It is said that he has been winning these two days." "You mean cheating?" The captain poured the residual wine in the cup. "I didn't see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Golding professional gamblers, it is not so easy to see." Fran comforted, picking up the messy poker on the table, carefully recognizing the sun, "such as the pattern behind a deck of cards, in the eyes of others, There is no difference, but in the eyes of the expert, you can tell him what card the opponent is holding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the card is a hotel."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not rule out the package."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn." The captain groaned because he lost too much. He is a little anxious Bad, "I said how someone would be so lucky, you wait, I will return to the camp and call a few brothers, he can't run."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the evidence? Do you have the right to detain him and go to the gambling master to identify?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran threw the poker back to the table. "I can't find a trick. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I saw the card, I also looked at it for a long time and sat back in the chair. "You are right, I can't see the poker passive." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A stupid way, in the afternoon we secretly changed the deck, if he started to lose. Explain that there must be some disadvantages, although there is no way to punish, at least to recover some money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "But I continue to lose? Maybe he didn't cheat?" Captain worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You lost me, winning is still yours." Fran patted his shoulder. "I just didn't convinced, but I was cheated." I can't see you." "Okay." Shangyu thought for a while, "Listen to you. I will go back to the barracks and take my cards." Then Fran went into the restaurant again. Andy is cocking his legs. Chewing a plate of tender chicken breasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, big winner." Fran sat across from him. "You are so lucky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Thank you." Andersi looked at the people with a sigh of relief. "You come to Queens Island and wait for the boat?" "Yes, I am the owner of the ship, waiting for the cargo ship to return from the east."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the black sailing boat in the port is mine."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it seems that you are rich." "It's fairly average. But I think you have trouble." "Trouble?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I am a businessman, it is normal to lose or win." Fran deliberately turned back. Looking into the direction of the casino. "But the sea is a soldier, but his temper is not good. You won the captain thousands of dollars. Almost two months' salary." Andrei is not willing to be troubled by this. "This guy is right. I am too proud to forget." He thought. Originally he should have been hiding in the room until the ship came. But for the gangsters who are very stimulating every day, if you don’t gamble a few times, it’s hard to pass these days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he didn’t expect to win so much, and the boat was late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I won’t bet in the afternoon." Andre nodded. "Please have a drink?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "No gambling? That's worse." Fran smiled. "The captain wants to turn it over, if you suddenly say no to play...unless..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Let me wait for the money to go back?" Andy heard the meaning of Fran. "Alright, but why did you tell me this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It's very simple. I also lost a lot, I want to take the opportunity to get back from you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, just do it." Ander Xihaha laughed and waved his hand. The owner’s words dispelled his suspicions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I look forward to getting back from you." Fran said that there was a chill in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrei did not cheat, but it would suffice to let others think that he had done something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are so lucky, stop here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game continued at two in the afternoon. This time, Andy began to lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one hour. The captain of the navy won back one thousand and four hundred. "The ship owner said that he was right. He changed his hand and started to lose. He had done it beforehand." He bit his teeth and said that he was not good. "You have to spit it out." This guy relies on tricks, two days. I lied a lot of people. Whether it is the glory of the military or the indignation of the private, he can't easily let him go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At half past three, the ocean-going ship to the east came earlier than Fran’s expectation. "Okay, gentlemen, I should go." Andhsey said, ready to go back to the room to take the luggage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you can't go anywhere, continue." The captain tapped the table with his finger joints. Behind him, he is standing with four physically strong sea soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t lie, say that a good ship is coming, I will leave." Andech stood up, and immediately, the seamen pressed his shoulder and let him sit. under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beware of my boss!" The gangster was anxious. But he was on the other side of the land, and there was no help for his assassin killers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Major Anthony is the commander of the Queens Harbor Navy, he is currently on the battleship. And I, the highest rank in the left-behind soldiers." , "Please continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You fucked and lost this hand," Andrew said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Laozi will play this hand." Shangyu’s forehead is braving the blue veins. "Either play it, or return to the military camp with me back three days later. Of course, I will be very kind, entertaining you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always only his unreasonable gangster who suddenly realized that it was this taste that was unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue." Andersy felt that he had fallen into a trap. But he can't go to the military camp, and he can't wait for three days. Otherwise, as long as he liaisons with the patrol hall of the Golden Bay, he flees from the insurgents’ chasing, but he has to be sent to the first frame by the authorities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This compromise deepens the judgment of the captain. "I dare not complain. He has a ghost in his heart." Until dusk, Andersi lost 60,000 pieces in one go. Shangyu nodded and said, "You can go, but you have to leave Queens Island immediately." "Why. The boat has already been driven away." "You are a thousand gamblers, it is kind to not send you to prison." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who cheats!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not recognize?, let me cheat The tools are found out of you? For example..." Shangyu pointed to the sea soldiers, "Take off his pants, I heard that the scammers will hide the lead props in the asshole."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Igo Andech squatted on the dock with a suitcase, this old shack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the buttocks, I felt a pain in the back door, which was just examined rudely by a thick copper spoon with a thumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was forcibly evicted from the hotel by soldiers. However, the boats that are moored at the port are all back to the bay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t go back to the bay, or he’s only dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andech is angered, I will make this tone sooner or later. Then he saw Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s all the troubles of this kid!" He took a deep breath and tried to hide his face. He walked over and said to Fran, "Mr. Boat owner, 1000. Maybe I can take your boat."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. Anyway, my goods have not waited, and I can't leave the business for too long. I am planning to go back," said Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t go back, just leave the port. I will kill you right away. The brisk black sailboat may be able to catch up with an hour ago and head to Mamouk's ocean freighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Black King just left Queen Harbour for half a mile, Andrei hid his pistol in his sleeve, licked his lips and walked into the cockpit, "Let me go The boat is really a mistake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For you, it is indeed a mistake." Fran smiled and looked at his gun. "Know "How much do I want to see you." "Is you doing a ghost? But it doesn't matter." Andechi opened four shots at the other's chest without pity, but what scared him was that it looked ordinary. The person still smiles at him and laughs almost crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s very painful. But it’s the feeling that I’m tormenting me every night and night.” Fran said, put his hand down on the steering wheel. Walk slowly toward the enemy, every step. His body swelled a point, and the four-particle bombs withdrew from the wound, and together with the fragments of the clothes, fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A monster that appears in front of Igo Andech. The gangsters know the dragon's pulse, and they have also sprung through many supernatural mysteries, but they have never seen this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the gun in horror, until the bullets were lighted, and then desperately watched the wounds heal quickly. Andy squinted at the deck and wanted to jump into the sea. He may be able to swim back to Queens Island and escape the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshots sounded again, and Andy was kneeling on the floor, "Damn, my legs!" he cried wildly. The monster picked up the pistol from the pieces of clothes. "Now, I will return the debt to me today, a total of seven shots, and six less."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monster one-handed Twisted Andy's collar, lifted him to the air, and fired six shots on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gangster’s head is sore to suffocation, the body is twisted with blood, “I... I don’t know you...” He pleaded weakly. “If you want money, All in the box."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster threw him on the deck. "You are not going to escape? Climb, if you can climb to the railing and roll down the sea, I will let you go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night Already coming, the yellow sunset slowly faded into gray, and Fran whispered to the big whisper. "This is what you said to me, and I will return it to you now."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrei’s eyes are scattered and his voice hoarse. “Hey, you killed me directly. How much hate is there, let you do such cruel things. I don’t know you at all.” "Don't forget, Feidu, prosecutor, you and the gorse, ruined my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are...Fran Fo Lyle... The hybrid that tried to judge me!” Andech spit blood, suddenly returned to the light, raised his hand and held Fran’s wrist tightly. “It’s you... tell you, yours. The wife is still alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anmei..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to know where she is? Go to Joe Corleone. Your enemies still include him. At that time, it was the killer, killing your grandmother and taking your wife away." Andrei said quickly, "Go find him to take revenge."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is Joe Corleone? Where is my wife?" Fran snorted and swayed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I know there will be today." Andre’s hand is gradually weak, "No one can escape from the trial of the meditation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to Joe Coleon desperately, no matter who wins, it will help me kill an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am waiting for the loser between you in hell, Igo Andrei thought, and then consciousness became countless pieces. Until the moment of death, his face was filled with a cruel smile, as if expected, there was a fierce tearing, about to begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joe Corleone...Anmei..." Fran gasped, looking at the body, murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, his back brain was hit, and his eyes were black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This man's head is mine." A familiar woman's voice floated in her ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran and the Black King were discovered two days later at a natural port in the bay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, man, what's wrong with you." Kregan apologized. "The ship was wrapped up in a naval battleship on the way to Queens Island. Come to meet you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are deliberate!" Lauvita said angrily to the giant boxing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss, don't worry. "Kregan looked at the girl. "What the woman knows." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing the spare clothes in the boat, Fran sat in the bow and ignored the quarrel between them. "There are two left, the gorse and Joe." · Corleone. Also, I have to save An Mei, she is suffering. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan jumped on the Black King and kicked the dead head on the deck with a kick. "That should be Andy, man, you." If you succeed, you know that you can do it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he was pushed by Fran on the plank of the cabin. "Don't call me a guy, don't you know how to honor it?" Please call, Mr. Kregen. "Fran gaze sullenly. "This time, if I want you to do it next time, you still have tricks." Then you will regret why you are still alive. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Damn.
