			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. At 4 o'clock in the morning, the rain stopped, the wasteland was blowing wet wind, and the fence wall outside the hotel was swaying, so that those were not The solid wooden strips are finely swayed, as if the sound of the whistling wind ensembles with a gloomy tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullan extinguished the candle on the porch table, pressed the money under the candlestick, put on the coat that had been baked on the fireplace, and gently walked out In the hallway, he stopped and glanced at the room of the Saint Samurai girl. The eyes were in the shadows, like two frosted stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue to let a mad woman with great force and hatred of herself, and endless tracking in Byron, will bring a series of unpredictable s consequence. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had made many assumptions and precautions against Matida’s recovery of his mind and his escape from control. The most troublesome thing was that the girl turned to the influence of the Holy See behind him. But in the conversation a few hours ago, Fran smelled a weird taste from the words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida seems reluctant to return to Anno, not out of self-respect, and may hide more secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, as a last resort, Fran is not a person who likes to use violence, he feels it is necessary to find out what is going on, to seek a more secure and effective removal. Insecticide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to admit that it is a cheap male complex. There are many opportunities for me to remove her, but my hands are merciless. I kill Igo Andech. When he executed Kregan and kidnapped Julius, he did not have a pity and a cold hand." He tightened his knees and thought to himself, "Education and the recognized morality made me understand that I should treat women and children in good faith. The males caused by hormones can make me think that gentlemen should be patient with women. Men will always become weak because of the beautiful skin outside the skull."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottom line, unruly compassionate and expensive is unbearable." Fran taunted his hypocrisy and walked along the narrow stairs to the brigade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog shrouds the wilderness, on a dull night, like a floating light smoke, the air has a moist fresh earthy smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The box is already placed in the car, and the two horses are tied. The stiff body was rubbed by a towel, and there was a lot of sweat, and everything was ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a gesture to the subordinates, the "departure" gesture, after the pedestrians checked the equipment, the open carriage was run over the muddy path, the wheels were smashed with mud and slowly drove away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eye behind the curtains watched the carriage away from it until it disappeared into the fog like a ghost. Nothing to trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medida leaned against the window, with a tired look on his face, the intellectual conflict, far more sleepy than staying up late, more deep Feeling tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you very much, but I still don't understand, but the answer I hoped for, I have to find it myself." The girl whispered, "I still have to find him." Look at him. If he is indeed a sinner who is hard to redeem, I will kill him, and then pay back his own life to pay off the grace that was given to me; if he can still reflect on it, I will advise him to turn back. Don't break into the abyss that cannot be redeemed. The old god also said that 'people should know how to let go, let go of anger, let go of hatred, let go of **, and let go of the suffering.'<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of destiny is a sinister scorpion, overlooking the mortal mortal on the scorpio, making their life full of drama. And take this as a pleasure. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the intellectual growth of Matida, when it is necessary to learn to forgive, Fran is like the girl’s original, and she is angered in the heart. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change in position is sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it’s awkward to meet again and again without any intention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the play of the hand of destiny, or perhaps the ridiculous writing of a third-rate author, let it come very quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is because of the estrus of Loli. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wet pine forest shrouded the hills after the rain. The old bark is covered with thick and thick moss. The mulch, which has been moistened by deciduous leaves, is filled with water. When you step on it, you will spurt the muddy mud and the water in the shallow puddle to form 涓涓. The trickle flows along the small ditch that is naturally formed. The first light is difficult to pass through the clouds, and when it is thrown into the world, the night-birds screaming and screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dawn, the dark blue and the blue sky, the wet wind blowing over the treetops, the white mist rising from the ground, in the poet's perceptual admiration, is like a lady who opens her eyes and looks good. The poet did not see it. It was only hidden in the woods, with the beauty of the devil, and made a bloody loli of the killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia tears her eyes, she has a finger, does not stop the tip of her tongue, bite with a small broken tooth, covered with wheat skin The sick redness, the whole person huddled together, lying between the branches and branches of the big tree, and the tail was shaking with powerlessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the top of her head, the bodies of four dead people are hanging, broken and invisible, these poor shadow king assassins, sticks Loli, who is multi-faceted and traced, but who is driven by them, is exhausted by the dense forest terrain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc girl estimates the blood of the leopard, like the savage instinct of the ancestors, likes to hang the captured prey high on the tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the tracking and anti-tracking of the night, with the enthusiasm of the fire, is already very thin intellectual, leaving Cecilia off the planned evacuation route. Lost in the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finds a stronghold and a meeting with her uncle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now she is not only hot, but also tired and hungry, a night of strenuous exercise, coupled with the body from the inside out, the heat has long been letting that Also filled with dissatisfied little belly, hungry and complaining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood slowly dripped down and squatted on the girl's face. Cecilia licked her pink tongue and immediately vomited and spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She enjoyed the carefully cooked food since she was a child, and as a little lady, how can she eat some bloody raw meat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't drink, hey, I want to drink soda from apple juice. There are chicken legs and hot soup of lamb." Cecilia is like a fairy tale. In the story, the little girl who sells matches, sipping delicious and delicious food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, she is more greedy, but also eager for a man who is as strong as a rock and will not be arbitrarily arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** Make people's brains flexible, people who have learned to grow and domesticate livestock; awe of nature, pray for blessing, people form towns, classes and religions; *, let the otakus divide the complex classification of Loli, Yujie, the Queen and even the foreigner... Similarly, after a night of suffering, Cecilia suddenly understood the sexual steps, happy The mysterious veil gradually reveals the true face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strictly speaking, it’s not a teacher’s self-taught, she just remembers, and occasionally in the middle of the night, she will be awakened by subtle but strange noises. It’s not that the sea tide beats the rocks, nor is it the bottom of the boat, the crazy smile of the madman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is very light, inaudible, and the ears of mortals are not noticeable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children are usually very curious, so she sneaked out of bed, circling a large circle in the cabin, slipping to the back deck, and jumping to the captain's room flexibly and silently On the balcony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtain behind the glass reveals a small gap, and she squints inward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the voyeur, Cecilia was shocked to discover that her uncle was bullying Lauetta’s sister! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, she still thought that her sister must have done something wrong, she was stripped of her clothes and punished, crying and shouting, and she kept asking for mercy, which was really pitiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, please, I @#¥%(mosaic)."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s really hard to stop me now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but why did the uncle take off his clothes? The two are stacked together and panting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc's shimmering vision made her clearly see that the uncle's back was caught with blood marks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the uncle also make a mistake? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small gimmicks are puzzling, but after waking up, they forget the doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, these inexplicable insights seem to be the key to extinguishing the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
