At dusk, he saw Tantin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing in the distance, staring at the horizon, the glorious city like a heavenly palace, people feel that the soul is also breaking away from the body, floating and indulging in the world Among the most immortal buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gives people the first impression, it is shocking, the mountainous white rock wall stretches to the far end of the line of sight that cannot be touched, the night falls, and it is impossible to say The green mountains and green waters are painted in pale black, but the power of nature seems to be inaccessible to Tantin. The lights of the huge city are smeared in all directions, and the night is also white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High 16k novels with thick and even iron plates.com starting with large walls, overlapping tower whistles and gun towers, exceptionally majestic gates, completely Man is a symbol of strength, but it is not a rough, purely defense-oriented fortress. Under the artistic magic of many craftsmen and masters, iron and stone, giant columns and domes, they even have the color of granite walls. The textures have not been let go, let these buildings fit together, wild power and delicate elegance, these two extremely perfect integration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three floors in the city wall, each with a wide space in the middle. The team enters from the Arc de Triomphe on the east side. The top of the long tunnel in the city gate is hanging. Attached to the iron fence door of the winch, the bottom end of these iron bars is also watered into the shape of a lion's head. When the door is lowered, it seems like a group of lions lying on the ground, ready to eat, are peeping at the enemy, it is said that this door The original site was the place where Como Emperor put down the whip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look up, you will find the one in the middle of the fence. The bottom is not a lion's head, but a face. This is another interesting allusion. Dongmen is a very famous architect. He was summoned to Tantin from his hometown. He was tired and dissatisfied with the design work that day and night. In retaliation, he will feature the appearance of Como. Mixed into a lion's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this move was quickly reported by someone who was jealous of his talent. The master of architecture was sent to the palace of the great emperor. He saw the monarch of Byron knocking his leg, his face full of anger, and thinking that he was in danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Duke of Artly Loved him on his behalf, "Supreme His Majesty, please forgive this stupid person, the artist is not only following the beauty. It is ignorant in other respects." ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, are you calling him a stupid person?" The emperor reprimanded angrily. "You actually said that even if I dare not say insults to him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Under the throne, he personally solved the bundled chain for the master, forgives his sin, and even the face lion did not order to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the face of art, only the gods can be beautiful, maybe hundreds of years later, not Tantin because of me, but I became immortal because of Tantin." The emperor said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now. The power of time. People and things have become dust, the only thing that can leave the land for later generations to appreciate. Only legends and such awkward cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tantin, even in the gap between each brick, there is a story hidden." Many poets are so emotional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinals Troupe received a warm welcome when entering the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are crowds on both sides of the wide street, the atmosphere is very warm, the girls shouted the names of several handsome actors, and Nicole was on the carriage Down, when preparing to walk into the hotel, the crowd rioted, crazy whistles and applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special officials of the Royal Courtesy Minister personally came to the hotel to receive the Cardinals. And conveyed to them the admiration of the royal family. "Mr. Ladies, as you know, three months later, it was the wedding of His Royal Highness, and I am very glad that the group can add brilliance to the celebration," the official said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of them have not been invited, and are not eligible to enter the Tandin Grand Theatre. They can only rent a square to set up a small tent for the tent. The eyes looked at the carriage of the Cardinals. "I don't think how good they are." The small theater group said sourly. "Not long ago, the Cardinals are still like us. Now they can perform for the big guys."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No way, I heard that they have made an investment, and if I have money, I can become a star."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Cardinal Theatre Company lived in the Heihe Hotel on the 1st Rhine Road. More than 40 employees occupied the entire building's top floor, including a large conference room ready to be temporarily converted into a rehearsal hall. “The first performance was in the week. After that, I hope everyone can work harder.” The head of the team said that her dream of going to the Tandin Grand Theatre has already been fulfilled. “In these three months, the troupe that was invited to perform at the Grand Theatre, together with us. There are only six, and the cardinals must be the ones that have the most applause."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that the wedding was held in the Royal Chapel. On that day, the most outstanding troupe, I could get a chance to perform in the square in front of the church." Lauren said excitedly. "If it is time, we will get the Byron chief. The reputation of the big troupe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Other troupes will think so, so definitely can't relax." Barry reminded, "Like flowers and swords, temples, etc. The old-fashioned troupe, our level is not necessarily higher than it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran smiles and smiles at them to discuss every detail, quietly from the conference room Exiting, "Peggy will become the crown prince, which means that at least for a while, the royal family will live in harmony with this wealthy family, and it will be difficult to bring her down."<br /><br />&nbsp ;########################################################################################################### Lan sees the little orc girl Cecilia staring at him with big wet eyes, "big I also want to go out to play."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, go back to your room, I will bring you candy when I come back." Fran wants to go out alone. He even advised to bring the girl back to the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the door of the hotel, Fran blocked the carriage, "Mr., where do you want to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go... the first court of the Justice Department of Tantin." He hesitated and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are going to do things? Now the court should have closed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I Go and visit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver is a bit strange, to say the tour, Tandindo is the place, the magnificent Colosseum, the historic building, the cathedral, Expos open at night are everywhere, and compared with their artistic value, the first court is simply a broken building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish." The driver shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s night, there are still a lot of vehicles on the road, and all kinds of single carriages, public carriages, and buggies are crowded. Slowly passing through, the carriages that Fran rented, struggled to cross the intersection and disappeared into the crowd of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hungry." Cecilia squatted on the window sill and looked at the night scene. The members of the ordinary troupe were four people and one room. The actress who lived with the girl told me not to stick out the window too much. Be careful to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter." Cecilia said with a smile, grabbed a grape biscuit and stuffed it into her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not physical, but a deeper sense of hunger, Cecilia looked out the window, the eyes swayed slightly green, formerly and Igo When the uncle is together, every time. Uncle will take her to a strange room and point to the person tied to the pillar and say, "If you eat him, you will not be hungry." Then in the scream of fear, Cecilia directly In the other's body, absorb vitality into your own energy. Looking at people who are losing their lives, their muscles and internal organs lose their moisture and become stone-colored dead bodies. Not only life, arcane, divine power and even dragon veins, she is a good child who is not picky. Can eat anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And absorb the thrill of pure energy. Deeply printed in the soul, as if every hair is screaming happily, compared to eating ten chicken legs. All come to be satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia sneaked into the busy actress behind her eyes and shook her head hard. "I can’t eat my sisters, I’m not happy to eat big men, but, I am so hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She still remembers that on a cold and dark night, the troupe picked her up from the woods, these big brothers and sisters Let's bring her hot water. Bring fragrant food, soft and warm beds. Although Cecilia is young, she knows who is good to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc girl gently groaned, she was condescending, looking at the crowd on the street at the bottom of the building, "Those are delicious..." The girl licked her lips . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her nose slammed a few times, her pupils shrank and gazing gazing at the distance. The blurry figure that is approaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Cecilia's favorite food, the smell of the dragon's veins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is ready to go out of the bedroom with nothing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't run too far, the children should go to bed early." The actress shouted in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I will be back soon," Cecilia said, then, seeing no one around, pushing open the windows in the hallway, lightly from the third floor Jump to the roof of a room opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is tracking the food atmosphere, moving quickly across the roof, using the city as a jungle in the night, the nature of seed hunting and predation, in the blood boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full meal, then a good night's sleep, and then comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida leaned on the back of Zolfa Longch, drowsy, and the other people looked curiously, looking at an old man, carrying A big girl, passing through the downtown area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The kind father and his spoiled daughter." People who saw this scene thought so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked the guard when I entered the city, the cardinals have arrived in Tantin." Zall said, "Take her back tomorrow, tonight Find a place to stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He passed the Heihe Hotel, looked at the luxurious decor, shook his head, he could not afford to live in this place, have to find a small home hostel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl suddenly moved on his back. "What?" asked Zall Law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems like someone is watching me again." Matilda looked around nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you are already a big boy, you still rely on your uncle's back." Zall's put the girl down. "The road below is going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Mattida replied slyly, but she seemed to think that the gaze that she had just brought was not curiosity, but rather a hungry person. On the road, I saw a hot fresh meat pie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, this is not a place to open to the public." In front of the first court of the Justice Court of Tantin, the gatekeeper blocked Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, sir, please fulfill my little personal interest. Every time I go to a city, I prefer to visit. It is not a place of interest, but a court, because I appreciate the reality in reality. Solemn, and the first court, in the eyes of the ordinary people, is like the court of heaven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The janitor is very eye-catching, although the other person’s appearance is very awkward, but From the details and talks of the clothing, it is inferred that this unique tourist, even if it is not a noble, is also a member of the upper class. He still hesitated. "Sir, your 16k novel is the first to know that my authority is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One hundred Caesar." Fran said. This number obviously touched the janitor. He took out the key and opened the side door. "Well, since you insist, you can only visit the lobby on the first floor, but don't turn on the lights. In case the prosecutor passes by, see the court. There is still light in the light, and I will blame me for not doing my duty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran took the candle holder from the janitor and walked into the dark corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candlelight was pulled long in the shadows, the straight walls seemed to be twisted, and the ghosts in the building were silent, only the squatting steps. sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pair of portraits on the corridor, all of which are portraits of the great figures of the Judiciary. In the lower right corner of the tarpaulin, their names are written. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yarvis Court Chief Byron 214-266, Bancroft Chief Prosecutor Byron Calendar 321-358..." He read Those names, then, stopped at a picture at the end of the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Peggy Don Reinschmann’s prosecutor is on duty," Fran looks at the portrait, a woman in a black robes, gently said "Ms. I just got it, you will become your honorable Crown Prince, but please believe that this does not delay the pace of my revenge, not only you, but also the Reinschmann family behind you, you and this The family likes to think of the human heart as a toy and the conspiracy as a game. Now, play a game with me, it will be very interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty minutes later, the janitor saw the tourists coming out from inside. "Can you be satisfied?" he asked when he took the candlestick back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Returned." Fran answered, suddenly felt that the trousers were squatting by something. He looked down and was a big dog, sticking out his tongue. , desperately shaking his tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
