			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Fran opened his eyes, the window was tightly covered by dark, thick curtains, and the room was filled with faint cool tones, making him unable for a while. Identify what time is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You slept for four days, the doctor has seen it a few times, and said that it is too tired." The head of the team is just pushing the door in, the eyes are red Red, the hand is holding a basin of hot water. Fran subconsciously touches the fake beard on his lips. Fortunately, the expensive glue is more reliable than the hypocritical person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four days?" Fran followed, and woke up, alertly, "What about the case?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry, the trial results will come down a few days ago, our little Paris, become a great aristocratic lady!" Barry's words can't hear any joy. Usually, she can be like a big sister, lovingly caring for every girl in the theater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not happy for her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, she is always well fed." Barry calmly replied, wring the hot towel and hand it to Fran, and turned to open the curtains. The noon's warm sunshine pierced the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steaming towel is attached to the face, making the spirit of Fran a shock. The attitude of the head is a bit strange, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you get dressed, Fran goes downstairs, and there are many things he has to do, such as aligning with Paris and the emperor, and, Tida fished out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his speculation, Matida should have been thrown into prison at the end of the lawsuit, and Dalmark had to find a scapegoat to step up. "She is a self-proclaimed The heir of the heir, the mastermind has escaped, and the woman who is crazy and stupid is not good at seeing us, and we are caught when we pack it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the excuse is unreasonable, But under the steps of the royal family who lost a little face in the dark, the Supreme His Majesty is not yet able to make greater moves to the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, are you awake?" Downstairs, Nicole waved at him, her always-lived, seemingly languid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can tell me. What happened during the two days of coma?" Fran turned back and asked him to follow him down the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, the troupe has had a lot of misfortunes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole gave him the answer very quickly. The red-haired girl cried and said, "There was a strange thing in the hotel in Dongcheng. Many people were burned to death. The police station blocked the scene and was verifying the body. Identity. I don't know what happened to poor Matida. The fire is very strange. Wood furniture and carpets are fine, but people are like candles, and they become a mud."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lauren went to the news, hope is a good result." Barry sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the saying goes, the playwright Lauren ran in with sweat and the clothes were full of sweat. "I got the news from my friends, the scene of the tragedy." There is no body like Matilda."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really!" Nicole gasped for a breath in his chest and stared at him suspiciously. "Don't send a message for comfort. The outside said, the body became a meat that could not recognize the dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No lie, my friend It’s the forensic officer of the police station. Hey, don’t look at me like this. In the west, I’m still a little connected.” Lauren explained, “The meat is too exaggerated, just burned the shape. From the residual hair, body characteristics With the pieces of clothes, there are no Matildas in those corpses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan fell down with peace of mind, obviously, Matilda’s supernatural ability to make firewood Then she should be fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the girl’s horrible power is restored. In this world, there can be few threats to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After processing the remaining affairs of the lawsuit, Fran is ready to go to find Matida. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who listens to himself and has magical powers will be a good helper for his revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran has no good feelings for Matida, a woman who has been killing herself for many years and almost killed him, who will have some hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a pure and innocent saint. It is not in the faraway East story. It is impossible to cut the flesh and feed the eagle Buddha, and it is impossible to have compassion and self-sacrifice for all things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Matida, Fran is only merciful, the girl is now a weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, one day, she recovered her memory and once again stood in a hostile position, Fran would try every means to remove this threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barui crossed the cross on his chest. "There is always good news. Lauren, you have not called the police, and Matilda is alone outside. Will suffer hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not yet, or will I wait?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;福Lan blocked the way, "Do not call the police, this will be implicated in you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it implicated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "At least for now, don't over-disclose the relationship with Matida, she may be treated as a scapegoat, and you will be a swindler's accomplice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this danger, let go of the poor girl." Barry insisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give it to me, I will inform Quasimodo, and look for him." Fran said, "One less person has an accident, it is good for everyone." Benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the team hesitated for a while, sighing sighingly, "Let's go back to the previous town and wait for your news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Napalis has nothing to do." Fran continued to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sly woman, what did she do!" cried Nicole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The identity is different now." Barry stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cut, when the aristocrat is great, it wasn’t that we were taking her in. It’s estimated that she was not being driven into the worst kiln, she was starved to death, Well now, once we have the status, we don’t even let us in.” Nicole said ragingly, then remembered Mathida, who was ignorant of life and death, and looked depressed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forget it. Let's pack up and go, let's go." Barry shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, François wakes up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened before the coma, the change in the personality of Paris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another thing that he ignored. When the Cardinal's carriage broke down on the road, Paris was standing next to him, nervous. Then on the same day, the girl gave the Matrida generously to the mother's relics that should have been preserved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This girl, seemingly weak and unconventional, is very deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not a clever chess player, but she knows to disguise herself with a tragic and docile personality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not going to see Paris again, the girl has used everything to get everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Cardinals rented a car and left São Paulo after not eating in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran looked at the dust from the window and looked up at the rear of the car. He paid the rent, lifted the suitcase, and was ready to leave, or flee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His false identity, how long it takes to find a remote place where no one is, and change back to the appearance of a ugly big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Fran didn’t realize that when he went out, a few people dressed in plain clothes and buried their faces under the sorghum hat were far behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sparrow's spy is well-trained and benefited from the news from the gambling city of Pena, one of which has lost all the votes. , still owe a large loan shark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the casino guards repaired, the Hawker wail, "I am a prosecutor, how dare you treat me like this."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has always insisted that he is Carl Tivin, who works in the Circuit Court in the West, but can not find any documents that can confirm his own words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy just got the message, "Two Carl Stevens?" She frowned thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning with greed, I want to use the power of the big man to get close to myself, take intelligence, and immediately become an enemy in court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could it be that he was sent by the secret organization of the Emperor’s Party, and impersonation would be unfavorable to the gorse? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The smart mind can't be wasted, but it can't stand on my opposite. If you can let him go, the family has an undercover in the dregs of the emperor's party. If he is loyal to the emperor, there is a lot of bodies on the edge of a ditch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notify the spy who tracks the prey, find a chance to grab him, tie Come and see me." Missy indulged for a moment, indicating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Emperor Party wants to play tricks with her, that’s fine, she will accompany her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambassador of the ambassador of Pobade was furious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He learned from some sources that the new Dalmarkian woman had relied on the gorse and privately reached a deal that was unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the content of the transaction is, it is certainly not the result of the emperor’s hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s happen that a member of the judiciary came to visit, “Karl Tiven? I just met him, it’s a bad gambler, it’s a shame in the legal profession. Is he the prosecutor who has recently fame in the case of inheritance rights? Impossible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has genuine documents, and it is indeed a mind People," Pobed said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, on the way to Sao Paulo, I heard that an expedited email was sent to the court where Carl Tiven was originally. He is in Pena City and is said to be Losing the money and losing the documents, and still owing debts, the people of the casino were stripped of the pants. The police station of Pena specially wrote a letter to ask if this person is a prosecutor in the court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viscount Pobed knows that he has been cheated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
