			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rhythm of life that has been rushing has been disrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three archbishops and a cardinal appeared in the city at the same time, accompanied by them, and a whole set of the Knights of the Holy Gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint warriors occupy the streets and lanes, they have the right to enter any of the most intimate personal industries for investigation, even the most distinguished Sir Alex Ferguson, do not take the risk The danger of being treated as a heresy is in conflict with the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of people on the streets is significantly less, and many shops selling Mamlok, Turanka and the more distant Shangri-La goods in the East have quietly closed the door. These exotic art pieces, seen by the samurai, are not allowed to be used as a medium for demon rituals or as a magical prop for pagans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hearts of religious fanatics, there is always only piety for the seal of light, they can not tolerate any artistic existence that is different from the church style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mamuck merchants who are too late to leave, are hiding in pubs and inns, many of them, because they carry books of their own religion, are brought by the samurai Take a strict inquiry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officials of the Municipal House comforted them and vowed that this was not a new round of religious wars, and they daring to negotiate with the priests, hoping to let them go early. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know, those people are honest businessmen, how can they have anything to do with heresy." City Councillor explained, "Now is the age of free trade. It is too inappropriate to deal with it during the period of the religious war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The samurai of the receptionist, the female knight who read the imperial order, According to the tradition of the Holy City Anno, the heads of each Paladin are served by the devout devout girl, who symbolizes the holiness of the Knights with the innocence of these girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the head of the girl is just a simple symbol. In the battle, it is still commanded by a deputy head who is experienced and skilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Seal of Light, the worldly Lamb is lost in the torrent of hope, please redeem these souls filled with greed." Matilda, The mascot of the Knights of the Holy Ghosts, looked at the smugglers with mercy, and prayed for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city councillor felt that the headache was terrible. Even if it was difficult, the businessman who tried to seek preferential policies, he could move out of the various conventions and debates all day long, but in front of this puppet who only knows prayer and mass, how can he take it? No words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to be willing to mess around and leave us in a ragged situation?" The patient who was ruined by the patient increased the volume and pressed I can't help but talk about the foul language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dignity and authority of the Seal of Light will not allow any offense, and for the immortal kingdom of heaven, even if the city is turned into ruins, it will not hesitate." Mattida replied with a serious face and categorically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member sat down for a while and got up and said goodbye. Walking out of the St. Mary's Cathedral, which was temporarily used as the headquarters of the Knights, he thought indignantly, "Does the fees belong to the church industry? What qualifications do you have to determine the survival and destruction of the city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the MPs, the inspector Lyme of the patrol hall, when he met Fran, who came to inquire about the case, complained indignantly, "The guys in the church almost deprived the patrolmen. All the rights, ha, in a blink of an eye, we become an idiot who can't do anything except salary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran also has a deep understanding, From the first court to the patrol hall, at least four cross-examinations, if not the identity of the prosecutor, depending on his rare brown hair and eyes, may be escorted by a saint warrior who believes above all else. Go to the pagan test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of test is said to be ridiculous, such as putting people on iron balls and throwing them down the river. If you are not a pagan, you will drown; if so, you can The spell of the heresy 浮du floats on the surface and has to be sent to the firearm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is simply murder." Fran could not understand this irrational behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let us praise the absurd, let the church take over the city's elders' council by default." Inspector Lyme said the opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran thought for a moment and said with a smile, "Maybe we can make this thing good within a certain range."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigator’s spirit is inspiring. He always appreciates Fran’s head. This guy can always come up with some practical and clever ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must first ask the bishops in the most sincere tone, and willing to do their best to catch the heresy. As working in the patrol hall. You will be welcomed by the old inspectors for decades. After all, the Knights are outsiders, and they have a few streets that are specific to Feidu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "And then?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then, some places where there is no evidence to obtain a search order, and there are doubts, you can bravely bring the holy warrior Going in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspector Lyme understands that in the belief that private property is above all else, if there is no conclusive evidence, the patrolman will be connected to a civilian apartment. Can't search. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take the Holy Warrior as a coolie to maintain law and order," the inspector said excitedly. "This is the casino that is hidden in private clubs and never pays taxes." Black market auctions may suffer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, here is the private industry You can't..." The attendant stepped back a few steps, screaming and stopping what would never happen, but the sound was getting smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of samurai prestige follows the inspector, the magic contained in the silver armor, like the ripples of the water, from time to time on the smooth mirrored shell The blue halo, the fine vine-like plant pattern hovering along the edge of the armor, compared with these walking crafts, the black leather uniforms of the patrol patrols are no different from the coarse linen clothes of the countrymen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Lyme, are you sure that this home is suspicious?" asked the samurai leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the information of the patrol hall, every few days, many people will come to the party by horse-drawn carriage. Those carriages are decorated without exception. The identity of the host is not the same, and the time of the party is usually late in the evening.” The inspector replied, “With a little guess, the patrol hall is unable to issue a search order, but for the glory of the seal of light, it is necessary to check it out. In the unlikely event that those gatherings are rituals of all kinds of gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, praise the light, I didn't lie, but here is more likely A stronghold for a black market auction." The inspector secretly thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team leader nodded in nostalgia and made several gestures. Twenty samurai were immediately divided into several squads, and walked into the front yard in a half-moon shape, surrounded by the double-decker main house in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards and the attendants in the yard, very handy surrendered the weapons, for the meager salary and the outside of the armor, there is a holy power in the holy The Knights of the Temple are desperate, and only low energy will do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the patrolman searched back and forth several times, except for a few servants and an elderly butler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., can you give a reasonable explanation for arbitrarily private residences?" The old housekeeper comforted the panicked maids and said annoyedly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspector Lyme carefully looked at the housekeeper, this is the old man of nearly 60 years old, his white beard and hair are neatly clean, black vest Underneath a white shirt with a bright yellow bow tie at the neckline, with a dusty brown wooden floor in the room, a painting by the master's hand on the wall, a luxurious flower basket-like ceiling lamp, a typical noble mansion and a A typical aristocratic family steward can't see any doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is your master?" the inspector asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The owner was invited to visit the capital of the city in the previous day and visited the Minister of Finance. He has not returned yet." Half of the old butler showed off half threatening to say, "He and the Minister And the friendship of several ministers is deep, and now you have time to withdraw, please believe that such behavior will be regarded as humiliating by the owner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please answer honestly Have you and your host participated in the ritual and shelter heresy of 亵du.” The samurai leader took the conversation and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspector turned his eyes, this straightforward, unskillful interrogation, others can answer honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old housekeeper stunned and asked for a cross. "The master has always been a devout believer in the seal of light, never absent from the mass of each week. How can I do illegal and unclean things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No truth, but no lie." The samurai leader raised his arm and unfolded his grip. The fist, in the palm of his hand, is shaking a faint white light group. "You actually resisted detecting lies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detecting lies is the most frequently used lower god of the samurai. This spell can distinguish the authenticity of the other's words from the displayed colors. If it turns from the original white to black, it lie, if it is red, then It is the same loyal and trustworthy mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protection spells or tough mental power can offset the power of detecting lies, but these should not appear in an ordinary old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, the old butler’s eyes changed, and the respectful expression was just an excellent acting. At this moment, the scorpion flashed with the beastly bloodthirsty brilliance. A little bent over, the patrolman around him was the first to bear the brunt, and a bloody spray was immediately sprayed in the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reactionary samurai just pulled out the sabre, and was blocked by a snake-distorted wave-shaped blade, the old butler’s armor The smashed the steel plate in the left chest of the armor and pierced the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple, vicious, one hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened between the electric and the Flint made the inspector Lyme stunned. This is still an old man. It is clearly a special walk in the dark to harvest life. Assassin master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servants who are still scared have drawn daggers and shackles from their shoes or cuffs. Unfortunately, their skills are not as good as those of the old butler, in the fight against the samurai. It quickly collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler was entangled by the samurai leader, although the assassin’s offensive was even more embarrassing, the leader stepped back a few steps, and the armor at the shoulder was also fierce. The spurs of the spurs showed a fine crack, but the balance of victory gradually fell to the samurai side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is in the lanes under the night, or the luxuriant grove, the assassin can find the opportunity to retreat even if he can't kill the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wide hall, there are no hidden shadows and eye-blocking obstacles for him to hide. The experienced leader is entangled in his hard-faced confrontation, which is obviously right. Assassins accustomed to sneak attacks are not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a bluffing spur, the assassin, while the leader is still in a defensive posture, quickly chose to retreat, he slid in the direction of the stairs, wanting to use the ladder Narrowness to avoid multiple enemies,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is a pure warrior with him, then the assassin’s plan will be awkward, but the assassin has forgotten that this is a holy warrior with magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his retreat gave the holy warrior the opportunity to release the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rope-like light wave wraps around the assassin's body, and the second-level magical technique cannot completely impede his actions, only let him delay for a few seconds. Clock, but this is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolfing a slap in the face, barely escaped the long sword from the sky, the assassin looked up and found in horror that the samurai were behind The musket on the back has already been loaded with ammunition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing the assassin saw was white smoke from the barrel and countless Mars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until seeing the old butler’s ridiculous corpse, twisted and fell in a large pool of blood, Inspector Lyme was relieved, he was afraid Wipe the cold sweat on your forehead with soaked sleeves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inferred from age, he should be the famous old assassin Maidjes of Golden Horn Bay." Inspector thought, this high-handed, killer career The assassin master who has done countless major cases has a lot of information in the archives of the patrol hall. "Fortunately, it is with the samurai. Otherwise, with him alone, all the patrols including me can be solved." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does Medjes appear in the capital? The inspector quickly got the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true eye of the holy warrior, the magical eye-shadowing technique disappeared, and behind the mural painting on the second floor, there was a secret door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person hiding behind the door has given up the resistance. The man is about forty years old, with a thick beard on his forehead, a handsome face, and a mature man’s taste. The slightly collapsed nose and the yellowish skin show that he is a mixed-race child with both Tantin and Mamlok. He sits quietly in a chair, as if he is a wealthy person who has been accustomed to food and clothing, but is strong. The arm, the sneer and the blue eyes that are always hung in the corners of the mouth, and the occasional exudation of the blue eyes, also indicate that he should not be able to see the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This image was quickly matched with a memory of Inspector Lyme, "Igo Andech!" he shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man opened his mouth and smiled, revealing a neat white tooth. "Yes, I am Igo Andech."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a proverb in the East: "I don't want to enter the tiger's den, I won the tiger." The inspector felt that this sentence was very effective. Igo Andech, the biggest gang leader of the Tantin Empire, the gang he led, did not do evil, smuggled, kidnapped, Murder, black gold trading, not counting the crimes in the dark, just by the record, is enough to send him to the guillotine ten times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wanted list, his reward amount is six zeros. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the number one wanted, has been living a life of arrogance, a lot of coveted mercenary groups, catching the wind and searching for his tracks, in the end, instead Because of the constant assassination, the courage to continue is lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assassin Master Madges is the right arm that Igo relies heavily on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most famous assassination was in a six-year-old, a baron who was deeply influenced by mystery novels, and was quite a family, trying to make a story in reality. The detective's heroic attitude, spent a lot of money and manpower, and even chased Igo with a private guard, so that some night, the count of the dreamland was awake by the cold wind blowing through the window, when he slammed the door. When the windows got up and were ready to be closed, the things side by side on the bedside table made him mourn the extreme fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vase on the bedside table did not know where to go. Instead, it was the wife who slept on the pillow, and the son of the next bedroom, who was cut off by the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his daughter disappeared that night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the tragic night of terror, the baron was insane. Finally, in the case of careless negligence, the fragments of the porcelain bowl were used to cut off the aorta on his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Igo Andech." Inspector Lyme shouted again this sinful name. "You were arrested, you will stay in jail." At the bottom, waiting for the trial of justice, if it were not for the damn law, I would like to tear you into pieces now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, hope is a Comfortable single room." Igoo stood up indifferently, the corner of the bed, the bed that had previously been blocked by his body, also appeared in the inspector's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
