			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Fran Fryer would like to meet his wife in a warm and welcoming atmosphere, kiss her bite, and forcefully breathe Embrace, confide in the bitterness of the parting, blame the wrong things she has done, try to make up for the debts she owes, for her atonement and pray for justice, not to punish her alone, but at least for now, this thought can not be achieved, An Mei to him Be wary, and Zall Law is even more eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is calm and calm, his heart is frustrated, the cruel joke of the hand of destiny, let him stand in front of the love, but can not spit out the hot words, only Can continue to be blinded by falsehood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he must cheer up, everything is getting better, he has been for four years, compared to the long one, more than 1,400 days and nights, the moment Although it is particularly difficult, it can see hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some spare food in the kitchen cabinet of the Golden Goose Tavern. Fran searches for it, pulls out a few small tomatoes and half a pound of bacon, and half a bottle. 42 years of rum, he poured three cups and asked, "Mr. ladies, what do you need to eat? We should have found a more appropriate place to discuss the details, but whether it is me or your identity, it leads to Can't be seen together in the streets where the eyes are mixed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really dare not eat a person who claims to be proficient in potions, the food that I made." Law is squatting, he is a little hungry, and there is a kind of exhaustion after the anger, his mind has calmed down, he constantly analyzes the new information and the changes he should make. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man who has the power to heal and can change his body shape, an unexpected alliance, the old man’s eyes flashed with the color of the work, scanning Enemy and new allies, sneer in the bottom of my heart, "Are you still a human? A monster wearing a human skin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let the lady come, minced tomatoes Salad, I remember that the taste you made is not bad." Fran told Anmei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl raised her eyebrows, "First and no matter why I want to cook for you, salad? Is it delicious? I don't remember that I have this kind of Craftsmanship.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Trust me, believe in yourself. Your food is great, maybe you walk into the kitchen and you can remember what you remember.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anmei thought about it for a moment, wiped his hand, stood in front of the kitchen counter, and looked at the pot, spoon and a bunch of spices very strangely, she took it awkwardly I got a chopper and felt that there was no bloodletting. The "small dagger" that is not sharp enough is really like a toy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran gently walked over and pointed at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The knife is good." He picked up a sliced ​​tomato and stuffed it into his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think that the assassin master is a fool who won't make a knife?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, respectfully the assassin, the seasoning should be less, the intensity of the mixing should be moderate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original is similar to the poison, in the blade There is a difference in the amount of the poison. The effect is also subtle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...you can understand this too."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taste of the salad is very general. But Fran quickly ate out, and the man’s heart was half joyful and half bitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zall is slowly putting simple dishes into his mouth. For a moment, he seemed to smell a warm atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He won’t believe in this enemy’s rhetoric, but he’s superbly lie, usually half-truth, and Zall’s method takes a little more time to identify Real and disguised in order to pile up things that are concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the dark tavern, Fran explained his plan with reservations, and Zolph touched his chin and took a cold breath. He has to admit that in the past it was really a small look at his enemies, and the other party was indeed deceitful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Do you want the gorse and the royal family to tear the skin and not continue to coexist? The energy of both sides should not be underestimated, I can expect one In the field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not an anarchist, nor intend to make Byron chaotic, just need to cross the Reinschmann family, and because of you The addition of can make the plan more fulfilling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A wonderful Opportunity. Can also elute your wanted identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is that Fran just learned that Zall Law and An Mei fled the film king organization together. I started to conceive, but he couldn’t ensure that Zall Law would follow suit and only be a substitute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the arrangement, the old man smiled. "The reason why I became a wanted criminal is entirely because of your tricks. Now you want to bleach me up? Isn't it afraid that I will take the opportunity to retaliate and let your business be destroyed?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I can hardly trust you, so it is very difficult to entrust this to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I will guarantee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking is An Mei, the power is not the girl’s long term, she has been listening silently, this self-proclaimed friend The plan proposed by the man is indeed easier to achieve than the simple force, so she promised, "I can't compare you with your brain, but supervise you that you won't be a private ghost, but there is no more suitable candidate than me. I have noticed that you have any act of betrayal, no matter who you are, please prepare the coffin at the funeral for the next moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisdom is the rudder of the voyage, The force was the lubricant on the steering wheel, and the three of them quickly reached an agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one thing was not arranged properly, Fran finally said to An Mei, "About Lavetta, and Cecilia, I don't want you. There was a misunderstanding with them again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed in secret, when he mentioned Lauvita, Fran had a derailed husband who admitted to his wife that he had The mistress's jealousy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That was not my personal wish, but the official organization of the organization. Now the movie king is my enemy, and I can’t continue to fight hostility." An Mei certainly didn't realize the complex mentality of the man. She replied easily. "As long as the two girls don't take the initiative to provoke me, they can be safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This works 16k novel network exclusive text version of the first release, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s a good relationship or a debt, we have to admit that Fran Flair is a very woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another trouble from a woman is approaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medida Hepburn, no, it should be Miss Saint Marrakech, stopped in a town on the coast, she was dressed in plain, dressed in the village The kind of linen gowns and fish rubber bottom shoes that people are accustomed to, the long flowing hair is cut into a flat head, which makes people look far away and mistakenly think it is a beautiful young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the day when the town church publicly preached. In the town square, high canvas sheds and wood pulpits were set up. The church members, the quasi-believers and the simple people who watched the bustle were surrounded by the square. The gods are shaking the brass bells of the ceremony and reading the words of the holy flowers on the holy script. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loyal followers prayed devoutly, praying for the glory of the Lord, and escaping the infinite abundance of the abyss after death. Those who are not so pious to the church are also full of sorrow, even if they don't believe it, but it is not a bad thing to show awe of mystery and majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of specially selected children, around the pulpit, gently sang praise songs with childish children, they have not received professional training. But from the child's pure heart and tender voice. Still let the songs fill the ethereal ethereal taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Father sees in heaven, whether it is tall or dark, and the dark valley; the Father sees in heaven, and controls your clothes to be brocade or lonely; the Father looks in heaven... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The samurai girl closed her eyes slightly, wondering whether she was infected by the surrounding atmosphere, or her heart was fluctuating. Her face was red and her lips were silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, she glimpsed herself in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible memories, like the lurking cold arrows, always when she wants to forget. Once again stabbed the soul. Cruelly torn the scarred wound, let it bleed, so that she can not rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The Father is watching in heaven. Pity for you, sigh for you, grieve for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Becoming a part of the choir, it is undoubtedly a kind of honor and liberation for the children of the seminary. It represents a status and encouragement, not only can temporarily boring the teachings of the scriptures. After the brain, the dishes are more abundant than the ordinary young students who can only eat beans and thin bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theological Seminary is a bitter-cultivating lifestyle, morning prayer in the morning. Prayer in the afternoon, Mass in the evening, and prayers before going to sleep, everything must behave in a proper manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making a mistake, you have to whip, or hungry, as a little princess in the family, Ma Dida, when I first entered the seminary, often because of the small incompatibility. The nun was swayed on the back with a few whip and closed into the quiet prayer room all night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom... Dad, I want to go home." Matilda choked with tears, only the moonlight that came in responded to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is very envious of Fei Yi Li Lisi in the same bedroom, that is a good and good student, a young lady who is very popular with the tutors, but also a choir Lead singer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Li Lisi, the child is not only smart, but also a scorpion like a white spirit." The gods and we all praised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a time when Li Lisi was very kind to her, and she only dared to sneak out of bed in the middle of the night, steal some bread and apple from the kitchen, and sneak into the quiet The prayer room, from the small window on the door, was given to Matida. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you can remember to wipe your face clean, if you find it, don't say it is what I sent." Li Lisi whispered "Thank you..." and so on, Ma Tida gorged, filling up the little belly after going down, remembered to thank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is quiet, the moon is quiet, the two girls are so separated across the door panel, there is a chat without a ride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the days of the seminary, this little friendship is the only thing that Mattida is worth remembering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until her first call to the Holy Flame, the harsh and boring trainee's career, there are still some wonderful decorations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s a natural disaster for others, but it has brought disaster to Matida. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Losing friendship made her depressed, lost her father, but made her desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the girl's spiritual world, this is a wound that can never be healed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floor of the white jade is covered with embossed panels, the vine-engraved mass is engraved on the floor, and the veiled vertical accordion is hung. The clear pool, all the details of the holy city of Anno, reveals the harsh holiness and the accumulation of fear over the years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including the execution of heresy, a trial angel carved on the wall, will sternly see the place where the sinner will die, the crossfire is in the human In the eyelids, the pillars painted in black, like the bloodstains that have dried up in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind in the morning blew the mist, shaking the bell drill under the eaves, sending out the sound of the call of the Lord, the criminals wearing white headscarves, the religious madness of the heresy, and the gods of forgiveness for the sinners. And wrapped in burlap and nailed to the shelf, it is already a heresy of half dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metida has not remembered how she was taken to the execution ground, where the atmosphere made her fear, tremble like a cholera. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sinner, tremble! Only fire and blood can calm the Father's wrath." A samurai shouted, he lit a torch. And then handed it to Matida. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is holding the burning torch in disbelief. She cringes and sneaks, and everyone in her eyes has a passionate and unreasonable look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida wants someone to tell her why this is why someone is guiding her and how to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that who urged to push a hand behind her. The girl walked a few steps forward and stood in front of the haystack under the torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s the hot word from the torch in the hand, or if I’m having a fever, Matida feels that her head is groggy and her feet are like cotton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shouted, "burn him! I will ignite him! You will save! The sin of the bloodline!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is like a thunder in the ear, everyone's eyes are concentrated on her, like blame. Like a command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl was taken aback, subconsciously let go of her hand, and the torch fell on the soaked hay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blazing flames and black smoke make the prisoners suffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teach Father, I curse you, accuse you, your cruel deity, only numbness and ignorance." The man shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the devil of hell, close the evil mouth, and swallow the words of swearing." The onlookers rioted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a young age, Matida squatted on the floor. The teeth are trembled. She wants to escape from the scene like hell, but her legs don't listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire swallowed the linen on the head of the heresy, revealing a face that was distorted by intense pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reveals the fire curtain. I saw the girl with a pale face, and the eyes that had gradually faded, suddenly brightened up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She heard him whisper in a trembling voice, "Baby, don't be afraid, I don't hurt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She personally burned her father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You hurt me!" Matilda heard someone bring The crying room yelled at myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Ai, the old god’s adopted daughter was looking at her with tears, and the girl struggled out of her shackles and hurriedly released her palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Metta's sister, what's wrong with you?" Little girl squatted. I am sighing at the place where I am pinched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the death of the old man, the new sentiment to preside over the church gods did not intend to adopt three cumbersome, some people found a way to send the two boys to the city, and became a A small shipbuilding site contract apprentice, but Ai Wei is a problem. No workshop is willing to take in a little girl. Mrs. Medo, who lives not far away, temporarily adopted Ai, but her husband is not happy and made a lot of private. Grievance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Medo is not a stupid little man. But for poor families, it is undoubtedly worse to have one more mouth out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also have their own children to feed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villagers miss the old gods and sympathize with the orphans who are homeless again, but the poor livelihoods have forced them to succumb to the suffering of reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a mistake, it’s just sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida has been lurking near the village, watching the children have a home, she sold her own dagger, the exquisite enchanted sharps if To the experts who know the goods, at least thousands of Caesar, the girl casually sold some money for emergency, secretly placed on the window of Mei many windows, she looked at the sleeping little Ai, turned and left to find the answer to her fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after a few miles, Martida noticed that someone was following her. She thought it was the Holy See searching for her holy warrior and hurriedly hid in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, a barefoot, panting girl appeared in the field of vision, is Ai Miao, she tied it into a simple parcel with a pillow towel. I was looking around anxiously, and when I found that I couldn’t find the target of tracking again, I cried and cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't fall asleep, knowing that you are back." The girl whimpered, and the foot was already grinded out by the stone. "Medida's sister." Let me go, wherever I go, Uncle Mayo doesn't like me, I can't let Medo 婶婶 always because I am wronged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matti It’s a very tempered girl who knows how to live together for a few months. The old god often smiled and said, “This girl, once decided what, a few cows can’t pull back.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about half an hour, Ai smear tears, carry the parcel, and continue in the opposite direction away from the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She chose to leave and she will not look back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Warrior understands what he is about to face, but she cannot watch the little girl fall into a ruthless society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a penniless, unaccompanied little orphan, the world is cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mattida sighed and chased the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the lonely, self-salvation path, she finally had a small partner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town evangelism is coming to the **, the preaching shouts shouted out the name of the Father, and the people attached their hands and shouted hysterically, praying for remorse and forgive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the non-Christians who are onlookers are also infected by this group of fanaticism and participate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Grandpa has never done this before, even if it is a weekly mass, it is also quietly praying with everyone." Ai Wei said strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
