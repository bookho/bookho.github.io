			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Tomorrow is the day when the Cardinals premiered at the Tandin Grand Theatre. All day, Barry Silana was in a state of nervousness. Since yesterday, she has never slept, and she has kept the script for a while, trying to find out from the lines that have been scrutinized hundreds of times. The place is right; I went to the props room and checked whether the dance clothes were off-line. She saw that everyone was not pleasing to the eye. As long as anyone was free, he shouted loudly. "Are you really ready? Are you ready?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the evening, Fran, who couldn’t stand it, pulled her into the room. "Calm, it’s good for everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know, there is the kingdom I dreamed of! Can't fail, can't be sloppy." For the troupe, the Tandin Grand Theatre is equal to the Knight's Hall of Honor. It is the majestic crown full-text novel read by the king on the head, all in the .com (piaotian.com. Wen. Xuewang, Baru's tone and expression when mentioning the Grand Theatre, all reveal awe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "I know." Fran said gently, he pushed the head to the mirror. "Oh, everything is fine, the only bad thing, only you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barry in the mirror, seeing a hair scattered, face 憔悴, black A stupid woman in the eye.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heaven", she squinted, "What am I doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, tomorrow, glory and victory belong to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you really succeed?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The audience are cheering, even the stars of the sky are as if they are shaken by the applause." Fran hypnotic, whispering in the ear of the ball, "The stage of the Tandoor Theatre will be red In the world of birds, it will be worshipped by everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That will be the world of the Cardinals." Barry muttered, she sighed. "Thank you, I feel much better." She turned and rubbed her hands around Fran's neck, rubbing her feet and sipping a kiss, because her height was too big, her soft lips only touched the man. Chin.<br /><br />&n Bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be a gentleman. This time you should bend slightly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go well to sleep." Fran took Barry's arm off his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this an invitation?" The head of the group looked at the beautiful eyes and looked charming and charming. "I don't mind dating you in bed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day, this woman loses her mind, and when she is lively, it is really hard to fight. Fran thought with anger and funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he saw that Barry moves naturally off his coat and skirt, wearing only tight-fitting small underwear, revealing the waist and slender thighs . Climb to the bed and drill into the quilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A person relaxes and sleeps." She yawned a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms., here is my room." Fran reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me sleep for one night, please." Barry said, "Don't leave before I fall asleep. When I am alone, my heart is still very confused." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran sat on the bed for half an hour, holding the hand that Baru reached out from the quilt and watched her fall asleep. Give a soft squeak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went out helplessly. That night, he had to sleep in the room of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the troupe employees. When I saw Fran and Barry coming out of each other's room, I was all surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole sneaked at Lauren, "Sure what happened, I actually missed the most anticipated gossip."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren laughed. "You don't seem to be nervous at all. It's the premiere at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No If necessary, we will succeed, and we can appreciate the performance of the Cardinals. It is the pride of the Tantins." Nicole held her head confidently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, the Tandin Grand Theatre. The audience was fascinated. The repertoire was "Lymemore's Lucia", Lauren's original five-face tragicomedy, telling the story of the two lovers' joys and sorrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Nicole on the stage read the sad lines, there was a sob in the theater, and when entering the cheerful story, it seemed as if the chandelier on the ceiling was smiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music gradually disappeared and the curtain slowly closed. The boiled applause sounded like a thunderous rumbling, and it rang for ten minutes. Barry led the actor to collectively call the curtain three times before the audience satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many reporters who have been invited to observe the newspapers have already thought about the keywords of the headline tomorrow: "Conquer!" Yes, the Cardinals conquer Everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the Grand Theatre and the officials of the Tantin etiquette department came to the background at the same time. "If you are honored, please have your team play another show tomorrow night." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the previous schedule, tomorrow is the tour time of the Flower and Sword Theatre." Barrie asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter." The person in charge said, "The audience needs you, isn't the applause just enough to explain the problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was even a church to send a bishop, but this time it was criticism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter whether it is laughter or sorrow, it is a cheap feeling. Only praise of heaven and piety is the right way of drama." The bishop said sternly, "in Tantin After the tour, I represented Anno and invited your group to perform in the Holy City. I believe that every believer would like to appreciate the classic moral drama "The Fortress of Fortitude" by the Cardinals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overnight, the Cardinals are no longer a Star Troupe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a superstar big troupe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Cardinals perform amazingly well, and the royal troupe of the royal wedding is likely to be it." Earl of Finance, Lord Enrique, made two cubes of sugar into the coffee. Stir slowly with a silver spoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Occasionally, the new member of the card I recommend, Lord Simomodo, is the major shareholder of the Cardinals Theatre." Viscount Kate said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, our Viscount, the story of the Mr. Knight, has heard you talk about it several times." Tandoor's famous banker Elro said, "The footprints of the world's great adventurers, can The moon god, worth 100,000 pieces, will not hesitate to return to your generous rich man, who was received by the Emperor Shangri-La and awarded the title of Marquis, and now has another identity: the owner of the famous theater company."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The East is not called Marquis, but Zheng Zhiqing!" Kate stressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, what is his name, anyway, the title of the east side can not be used by Byron." Elro shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in the lounge of the Pegasus Club, and several big people are talking casually. "His Excellency, you mentioned that the Lord Ingram of the Ingmar is looking for an investment project?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elro immediately laughed "Whether it is the finance minister holding the key of Byron Vault, when can I think of investment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But my finance minister can be bad, a few The wedding after a month, but not a small expense." Finance Minister stalled, "Which money should I deduct from the budget of the department? Whether it is the Security Department, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, or the House of Lords, as long as Moving their budget of a dime, I can make me feel bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, is it a wedding, can you empty the emperor's pocket?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is true." The Finance Minister replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was nothing wrong with the wedding, and the Earl of Clifford was most worried about the identity of the bride. The old party led the family's gorse and extended its power to the royal family, which is for him as a member of the emperor. This is not a good phenomenon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the majesty of today’s sacredness can suppress the elderly party, what about his centuries? The performance of the crown prince is considered a benevolent, but definitely can not be called the tough name of the wrist. It is said that the Crown Prince Julius is quite obsessed with his bride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Emperor’s preparation for? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Kelly tried to keep his thoughts out of his head and continued, "I don't have any opinion about Mr. Jean Knight becoming a member of the Pegasus Club."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no opinion." Elro said, "It is the depiction of Lord Kate that I can't wait to see this person in the legendary story."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is very simple," said Earl of Kelly. "A few days later, the royal family had a party, invited by the national envoys and the social celebrities of Tantin, the right to open an invitation letter for a foreign Lord. I still have it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Party?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the theme is to introduce the two newcomers who are about to get married, and also show the countries, Byron Political stability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elro did not ask again, he certainly knew the dispute between the parties, but as a banker with money for money, no Need to get involved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Information Sharing Center houses nearly 60,000 publicly available file files. The task of Zall Law Longchi is to put the information sent to the center every day, and archive it according to the type. This is a boring job that doesn't have to be a brain, and is cumbersome to the extreme, from busy to early. Only one week. He wondered if his ass had been stuck with the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now licking his red eyes and closing the file in his hand. Zall is not willing to be a small intelligence analyst, but in front of him, there is a great opportunity to get him out of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy Don Leinschmann, the most distinguished lady of the Justice Department, is currently losing his temper for a case without evidence. Zall Law believes that the documents that have been turned out from the 60,000 dusty files in the Information Sharing Center will greatly help the case. He took the file in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the door of the archives room, go downstairs, and walk towards the judicial building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Longchi trainee analyst, you spent three days in the archives, and finally got it." On the road, I met my colleagues and said with a smile. Only a week later, he succeeded in establishing the image of a geek in the eyes of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This idiot, the treasure is buried there, but I don't know how to dig the pile." Zall said, "If you can get Reinschmann this time." Miss's trust, maybe I can be a regular scout."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My dog ​​finally got the news." In the office, Peggy sarcastically said, "You have been looking for monkeys for a whole week. I really don't know that the safety department with a budget of up to four million a year will be so snail-like. The efficiency of the work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intelligence officer angrily thought, "Just for the dog, you forced the agent of the security hall to sleep a few days, God knows, In the city of Tanding with a population of several hundred thousand, it is difficult to find a lost dog." He resisted the unpleasantness. "Please forgive me. We just found out that the guests staying at the Heihe Hotel have taken over. It..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Peggy interrupted the intelligence officer’s words, went to the hanger, put the white fox fur coat on, and walked out of the office, right. The secretary said, "Give me a car, I am going to the Heihe Hotel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, an old man in black uniform with white hair is from the corridor Come over, "Hello, the Prosecutor of Leinschmann, I am a Longchi analyst at the Intelligence Center. Can you bother you for a few minutes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy frowned, ignored it and walked straight away from him. The guards of several palaces who were ordered to protect her guarded the old man with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Banson, the suspect you are suing, a decade ago, a famous fraud case may be related to him." Zall Law hurriedly raised With a kraft paper file, "The criminal wrists are very similar, this is a wonderful breakthrough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Show me." Peggy turned back and took the file, flying fast. Reading, but the page turning speed is getting slower and slower. Finally, on a certain page, she stopped and repeated it several times. "There is indeed this possibility," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every criminal has the same logic in planning a conspiracy. As long as you grasp the law, you can discern it." Zall Law explained, " If there is ample time, I believe that I can find out more deaths without catching the prisoners, and Benson is on the top."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peiji has Looking at him with interest, "What is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zolf Lungi, currently an analyst at the patrol department intelligence center."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s very good, at least it’s better than looking for a dog, it’s going to take a week for the security department to be strong.” Peggy nodded appreciatively, “and knows how to call me a prosecutor. Your Excellency, not your disgusting Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The car is ready, and it stops in front of the gate." The panting secretary rushed back and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't need a car, let me inform the Chief Justice and the inspector of the patrol department, the case has made new progress." Peggy said, then asked Zall Law, “Are you free at the moment?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Be ready to serve you.” Zallfa thought that Missy would let herself participate in the case analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you go to the Heihe Hotel now and help me pick up a dog named Monkey. I want to see it before I get off work. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of Peggy's disappearance at the end of the corridor, Zall Law does not know whether his expression at the moment is bitter or ashamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran was stunned when he saw the former secret policeman. He recognized that this person had pursued himself in the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Baru personally came to the dignity for Zall's law. She said to Fran, "This is the good gentleman, who sent the little Matida back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are welcome." Zall said. “Are you picking a strip with a red collar and a monkey dog ​​a week ago?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dog is the pet I am serving, a big man's pet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, you are here to retrieve it for him." Dog?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes.” Zall’s law is not willing to say that a person who used to be the captain of the dark police department is now doing the work of the errands. This made his self-esteem insulted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was about to leave, Barry asked, "Don't you meet Matilda?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
