When he was led by the secretary, he walked into the conference room and explored Long Limkus introduced him to the agents. "You, this is Mr. Longchi of the Western Dark Police."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, hell, What did the secret police come here?" A detective screamed ironically. This phenomenon is normal. People in the same profession will always look down on other branches in the field, just like the Lute harpsichords who look down on the piano players, the writers who write the orthodox operas, and the slang words that are dedicated to ordinary people. The drama is not pleasing to the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, please honor, this gentleman is our friend, he brought a message."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lyme stopped the riots of the detectives. From the introduction letter of his old friend, he can see that the western inspector praised Zall Law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary distributed the information prepared by Zall Law, about ten minutes, and waited for everyone here to read it quickly, Zolfa said, "This There are four extremely dangerous gangsters, one of whom is a royal wanted, and I have a hunch that they have come to Feidu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Premonition?" Shrug, "When the police rely on evidence, they are not street diviners."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although there is no conclusive evidence, I can reason about their mode of thinking, For wanted criminals, the best way to escape from hunting is to escape from abroad, and to hide in the name of a big city. The crowds that come and go, countless and disappearing faces are the best protection. But these are the best protections. All need money, and according to the Western newspaper, one of the prisoners, the gangster who is nicknamed "Gian Quan", did not have time to take large sums before he fled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Inspector Lyme heard the meaning, "You mean, in order to maintain their escape, they "Do you commit crimes again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, and the Golden Horn Bay, the most prosperous city, is Feidu, in the eyes of the unscrupulous. It is a drop of oil. The fat of the fat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detective felt resentful for this. "Please, the fee is not a small town in the west. In fact, the small case of thieves and other trivialities is removed. The case rate of Feidu is quite low in the country, but the detection rate is among the best. "Zall method is not heard. Continue to say, "A large sum of money is crucial to these fugitives, and the thief is obviously not enough. Therefore, they are very likely to do a big case in Feidu, once they can meet the needs, and then go far." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big case?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Robbery, extortion, kidnapping, fraud, the object should be expensive and expensive."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lim meditated, "very likely. But how do you find them in the crowd? The fees are too big. And because of the protection of private industry and trade, the city is not Maybe. If you dare to hand over the city application to the city council, in less than two minutes, he will be driven out by angry lawmakers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The bad influence and economic relief brought by the church closure of the city was the pain in the hearts of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The appearance of the wanted order in the information can only be used for reference. The prisoner will disguise himself and pretend to be another person, but can prevent it in advance. The human area is protected in a quiet manner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, we have a better way, the special weapons of the patrol hall of Feidu." Lime said, "One Years ago, a wizard named William, who made a wonderful invention through alchemy, he inscribed the charm on the ring and installed the receiving device in the patrol hall, if the person carrying the ring met in the fee range In the danger, only the press is required, the patrol hall can immediately receive an alarm, and the location on the Crystal City map will appear where he is. And he will be murdered. When he dies, the ring will automatically alarm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there such a thing?" Zall was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, great invention, but the Master has already left Feidu after receiving huge rewards. This method cannot be widely used, only limited. In the hands of the rich.” Lyme laughed. “The rich people are willing to pay a little money every month, and they can enjoy all aspects of protection. As long as the prisoners dare to take the shot, we can find them immediately.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much is this person who knows this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only inside the patrol hall, and wearing a ring, the rich man, It’s impossible to know the prisoners coming to the west.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zall’s law nodded and suddenly thought, “If the victim does not think that he is in danger, Didn't press the agency?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole meeting room people laughed, "How could there be an idiot that I didn't even know if I was kidnapped?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, maybe it is possible." Zall Law barely smiled and groaned in the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayre Duna heard that the next day, he was always restless, and the audience attended the meeting and the president of the meeting talked privately. This weekdays are endless, and they love to express their opinions. What happened to the people of speech today? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, how beautiful the face, the shy blush is like a red wine drop on a white porcelain plate; delicate lips, than the most fragile flower core I still have to wait for it to be released. If the blush is more beautiful, the pure lips will contain me..." He kept thinking about the last night's avoidance, imagining the pleasure of enjoying the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dunner Wen, is there something to eat?" A big prosecutor interrupted Ayr’s thoughts, and he woke up. The meeting arrived at the moment of the afternoon recess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am thinking about the scope of the fourteenth regulation of the Code." Ayr said that he could not stand up. The crotch bulged into a large group, but fortunately the president's robes concealed the embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a quarter of an hour, he stood up as if nothing had happened and was going to eat at a restaurant near the first court. As he walked through the arch of the main entrance and was about to step down the stairs, the water curtain behind the Mutu Fountain was faintly beautiful, leaving Ayr to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl who was last night, was red-eyed, so pitiful like a seedling that had just been baptized by torrential rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ayr noticed that she was wearing very ordinary clothes, rough handwork and cloth revealed in the sun. It’s not like the dress of Miss King, which makes the president very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., how are you?" The girl was equally astonished, wiping dry tears in a hurry and pretending to be calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ayre has a very good set of women, and with his kind concern, he quickly knows the passing of things, very simple things, because yesterday was home late After being blamed by the rich man, the young lady ran out of anger. And he also learned that the girl's father is a well-known long-distance boat owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Interesting, it's really interesting." Ayr thought, the ship owner just happened to know, although not familiar. But know that it is a coward who has no wife and children and will only make money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus the girl looks elegant, but in the eyes of the experts, all the clothes of famous counterfeit goods, Ayr smelled the conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unskilled people can't be the president, although the coveted girl is beautiful, Ayr's mind is still quite clear. He sneered in his heart. "Hey, what happened to me? A liar who is a famous lady." This female liar is very clever. I don't know how to get into the club. I want to seduce a few fools and lie to their money. Unfortunately, she did not know that fraud has been revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s more advantageous, Ayr greedily looks at the girl’s long white neck and hooks up with a lady, maybe it will cause trouble. After all, they have rich and powerful fathers. It will apply anger and revenge to men who destroy their daughter's innocence. But a female liar? Not being sent to prison, she is already very kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayr can imagine when he reveals the scam. How can this beautiful girl squat at her feet and seek forgiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to play with the liar, which is much more interesting than a boring meeting. Of course, he will protect himself cautiously. The liar may have associates, but they don't even know that the new method of the patrol hall of Feidu, the ring of the alarm, is wearing on his finger, as long as he is in danger. Within five minutes, the patrolman will be able to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look, this dress is really not for you, I will take you to the tailor shop in Queen Street to buy one."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ayr said, and then saw the smug look in the eyes of the female liar, and immediately revealed a grateful expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really loaded, Ayl’s voice is full of disdain, “Oh, don’t deny it. It’s my pleasure to send clothes to the distinguished lady.” When you think about it, "I will earn money back from your body sooner or later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowetta licked his lips, this guy has been fooled, mistakenly thinking that he I am playing a game of cats and mice. She remembered the boss's evaluation of the president: lascivious, but very clever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general little trick can't fool him, so you have to design a trap in the trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let him step on the second trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ayr is very puzzled. When buying clothes, the girl insisted on paying her own bills, even for lunch, she insisted on giving it, and also stuffed the waiter with a five-story tip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is very greedy, and she is still playing rich people, wanting to get bigger money from me." Ayr thinks this push side should be correct. He patiently waited, the liar will always be exposed to his true colors, and he will be better threatened when he holds the evidence. "Either go to jail or go to bed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At dusk, the female liar finally started to act. "Hey, you are so good, let's go to the hotel to open the room, happy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, I am Think about it," Ayr said. This liar can't wait, a real big lady, can not invite men in this tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put on his hat and opened a room in a hotel under a pseudonym. After all, Al Dunawen is a celebrity, he does not want to be recognized by the hotel hospitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautetta cheered and jumped onto the bed, glaring at the side, lying on his side, suggesting Ayr with his eyes. However, the court has hesitated at this time. The other party has not defrauded the money, will it be so simple? There is a trick in it. Ayr poured a glass of water for himself and sat down comfortably on the chair to prepare for the showdown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What purpose do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strange man, what are you talking about?" Lauvelta walked over with a smile and pulled the collar of Ayr's shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Less, I know who you are? A liar! You must have never thought of the shipowner you said, I know." Ayr pushes the girl In the fight, the shirt was torn open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! I know that Carmen’s old guy can’t do it.” Lauvita didn’t panic in Ayr’s imagination, she shrugged. “Forget it. You are leaving soon, after all, a handsome guy like you, stronger than Carmen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carmen?" Ayr jumped up, "Feidu General Court Long Carmen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, that is the old thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please say it." "No need, he gave me a lot of money, but since it failed, I don't want to harm you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayr After thinking about it, since the Dunawen family has relied on the gorse, the rights in the judicial department of Feidu have become more prosperous. His father, Duyun Wen, has retired behind the scenes, but still manipulates a large number of court presidents and prosecutors. For the Chief Justice, it is undoubtedly a shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the name of the gorse makes Carmen dare not play big moves, only to make small frictions in private to vent their dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much did Carmen give you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A thousand Caesar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I don't have much cash, but you see." Ayr wrote a pen, wrote down the amount of 5000 Caesar on his personal check, and signed himself The name and date. "Five times the price, tell me what you know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liar looks at the check. I bite my lip and think about it, I agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple trick that is enough to ruin your reputation. Earl of Carmen learned that the gorse intends to marry the Dunawen family. He could not tolerate the influence of Dunawen, so he found a sly niece, posing as a shipowner, as long as she and she are now in bed. . There will be a good show in the scene where the father meets his daughter at the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the ship owner forced himself to marry her, tangled, confused the water, even if it was exposed, he also fell a laughing stock. With the heart of the gorse, the marriage is also finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I not know about marriage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your father knows, but things I’m still not sure, I’m still thinking about it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayre understands the character of a dad, the father just wants to do anything, he will never consider asking his son. Thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn. I still want to play for a few more years. And the daughter of the Golden Sparrows is not necessarily the beauty of Peggy." He is in the room. Crossing, "You said that the crapper. Will it appear in the hotel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, he should be in the downstairs hall. Maybe the Earl of Carmen and a few famous people will happen to be there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have already gotten it, now I can't go out." Ayr looked at the broken shirt. "Who would believe a man with a disrespectful man, and a beautiful girl in the same room, but nothing happened?" He touched his lips and said, "You can Testify for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't dare to offend Mr. Carmen. I will lose money when I receive the money tomorrow." After receiving the money, the liar started to give it to Ai. I made a plan. "Wait is not the way, ask your father for help? He may have a way." Ayr thought for a long time, called the room service, gave him a sum of money and a letter, "Give me a shirt, and then send the letter, The address is on the envelope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I am as soon as possible." The waiter bowed his head and said, his eyes wide open. From the crevice of the shirt, he saw the right side of Ayr's chest and had a birthmark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The meal service in this hotel lobby is two o'clock in the morning, and people with identity cannot go to the proofing and still can't go. I and you must Waiting, then go out from the side door. "Aer sees the waiter out the door and whispers to the liar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hallway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran in uniform went to the corner of the stairs and quickly took off his jacket. He looked at the letter in his hand, "It became."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This works 16k novel network exclusive text version of the first issue, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Dunawen received a letter without an signature at 7 pm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, since your son took a non-cooperative attitude and tried to disclose the address on the letterhead, he gave him a little lesson. The ransom 100,000 恺 恺 放 到 老 老 老 老 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎 赎The stinky meat with a birthmark." The letter attached to Ayr was attached, with some red blood on the edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the note, I am in trouble. The specific matter is inconvenient to say in the letter, you are doing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please send someone to... The words behind are painted with ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s indeed Ayr’s handwriting, and the old Duna heard the police immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around eight o'clock, Inspector Lyme rushed to Duna, and the "positioning device did not show up. The patrol hall could not find the position of the president." But what happened?” Old Duna heard, “My son wrote it, he was in trouble.” “Probably a scam, your son was cheated.” Some of the police officers brought by the inspector Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Old Duna smelled angrily at the speaker. Although he was strict, he was always proud of his son’s geomorphic device. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Zolfa Lungi, I suggest to surround the Green Agate Square and catch the prisoners. You don't have to give a ransom, you can wait at home. "Wait? Damn, my son is being tortured!" Old Duna groaned. "There is a letter from Ayr, the other person knows the birthmark of his chest. Can you explain?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This should be a clever scam, but what is it, I am still thinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for you I thought that my son would be finished!" He stopped paying attention to Zall Law and said to Inspector Lyme. "I am going to prepare 100,000 Caesars. If I save the poor Ayr, I will just toss you at the expense." Even if I apply for a closed city, I will help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 11 o'clock in the evening, Duna Wen’s manager put the box full of cash on the green agate. The designated locations. Inspector Lyme sent a few plain clothes in private and stayed nearby. Summer Night Square is a good place for a retreat. Many couples walk around or sit on a bench and whisper. Plain clothes don't dare to be too close to avoid revealing their identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are couples sitting in the seventh row of chairs, which makes the plainclothes alert, about 11:40, a carriage accident, turn Stop at the square and start overhauling the wheels. The carriage just blocked the sight of the plainclothes. Fortunately, after a few minutes, the driver took out the garbage hanging on the axle and drove away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the couple also got up and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The box is still under the chair. Plainclothes continued to wait until one o'clock, the square was empty, and no one came to take the ransom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One and a half... two points... After more than one hour of the designated time, the plain clothes were puzzled, and they carefully walked over and took out the box. "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager stared at the box and suddenly cried, "Heaven, this is not the one I put!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size is the same, the color is the same, but the ransom box is the high-end goods of calfskin, and this, obviously, is used to spread the goods. In the dark, it is far from the distance, which was previously impossible to distinguish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the couple!" The plainclothes recalled that when they were sitting in the chair, they carried a small box and it was definitely a packet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for two hours, it’s enough for the kidnappers to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay waited for three o'clock, the new shirt and his father's carriage had never been seen, he had to venture out of the hotel side door, fortunately, Did not encounter the old things of Carmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, I am leaving, go to the bank to get the money tomorrow." Lauvita raised the check. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go it." Ayr thought, the check was not stamped, as long as the female liar went to the bank, he would immediately be caught by the security guard for fraud. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he, smiling, made up a stolen lie and watched her being sent to jail. Ayr looked at the liar and disappeared into the corner. He reached out and blocked the car at night and rushed home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dunna’s big house is so lively, seeing the appearance of Ayr, the old Duna smells ecstatically holding him, keeps saying "When you come back, just come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayre looked at his father inexplicably, and looked at Inspector Lyme again, "Please tell me, What happened?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpts, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
