The administrator asked the old guards who looked at the car with some suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, this is a shuttle bus, and many places complain that the detention center is overcrowded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The roving judge who came out of the car then dispelled the Director’s doubts and was a judge who had known him for many years in the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I happened to go to the city to do errands. When I met a prisoner on the road, I let it go to the town deliberately." The judge and the director greeted, "How many criminals are waiting?" "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On one", "Well, by the way, you can avoid running after more."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial was conducted in a small office of the police department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Theft, arrested on the spot." The judge flipped through the file, "What is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Tobosso, sir, please believe that it is just an accident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge does not believe in the criminal’s rhetoric, this kind of street gangster who relies on theft for a living There is no truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even their identity is not well verified, landless people, orphans adopted by the head of the thief, everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is usually the best option for such people, penalizing money or going directly to prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bail one hundred baht, can you come out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has no money "Blanc interjected, "Even the meals of last night and morning, all from the police department, you can see if you can add some funds to the department."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is not my terms of reference, agent." The circuit judge said, and then sentenced, "six months imprisonment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran considered for a moment, "According to criminal law regulations, criminals have the right to choose to imprison or hard labor, the latter's time limit will be reduced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really an old oil Son. Maybe I should check your case carefully and judge for a few more months.” The judge satirized, “Well, go to the mine to serve the sentence, two months.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blan Lafran, "You are crazy. The days of the mine are not good. I have seen a fat man, stayed there for a few months, and only left the bones after coming out."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easier to escape than prisons and open pit mines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get a night, fool the guards, change back to Quasimodo in a secluded corner, pull off. With the speed of running after the transformation, even if the guards found out, riding a horse to search, it was too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes, he will be free and will not hurt innocent people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then mix in the crowd and meet the cardinals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran smiled. "Your personality is not suitable for the police."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe Bran replied, "I wish you good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A window full of iron railings was parked outside the police station, the prisoner will be Sao Paulo makes a short stay. Then send each prisoner to where he is going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more than half of the space in the carriage being transformed into a cage. The prisoners were wearing handcuffs and squatting inside, a total of four prisoners, and two fully armed guards outside the cage were watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car is just about to start. Bran asked, "Gentlemen, I am going to São Paulo by the ride."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not in accordance with the rules."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get it, the rules are rules, and the human condition is human." Bran is a veteran. "You are a newcomer, I have not been rejected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The guard exchanged his eyes, "Come up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prisoners all looked at each other with indifferent expressions, looking at each other with provocative eyes, but after touching one of them with a fierce sight. The eyes were removed from the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a strong and bald man, not tall, but his neck and shoulders are deformed, full of massive muscles, compared to the width of the shoulders. His head was small, and his arm was stabbed with a roaring animal head, and his fist was so thick that he could crush the enemy's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no sound in the car, and Fran felt that something was wrong. The tattooed man next to him, turned to the guard outside the cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard stood up and put his head out of the window. "Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This It was a secret number, and the van suddenly turned and drove into an abandoned road and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gentlemen, the wheels seem to have some problems." The driver of the car shouted, "Come and help check."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Bran sitting still, the guard pushing him, "Man, help the handle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Bran quickly pushed away The door, jump down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge also wanted to help, but the guard blocked him. "Sir, I want to tell you something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Please say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get a ride, sometimes lose your life.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The judge fell down on the lower abdomen, and the blood squirted the murderer. This sudden situation made the other prisoners surprised. "Come on the cage." "The tattooed man ordered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened? Hearing the noise inside the car, the little policeman Blan ran back and asked, pretending to be a murderer of the driving guard, raising a sharp dagger and cutting his trachea from behind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guys, whisper. "The tattooed man is majestic, let his men untie him, and then throw the key to the person next to him. "It's all on the road. I am Kregan. I must have heard of my name." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kregan! That big punch Kregan!" The prisoner shouted excitedly, "The famous big man in the west."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a previous accident Fortunately, people in small places didn't recognize me. I can't go to Sao Paulo, otherwise any ashes there will be celebrated with incense." Kregan said, "So I played such a play."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where the prison car is exactly the same." The prisoner admired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, that's true. But the ashes of the car are currently lying at the bottom of the river." Kregan laughed. "I am going north to avoid the wind." Head, you can also escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fo Lan was on the ground, holding Bran in his arms, the little policeman’s throat cracked a big hole, his face Pale, bloody non-stop, "I don't want to die, please." He desperately pulled Fran's sleeves, screaming, screaming, and getting colder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is an ashes not broken." Kregan came over and asked for a machete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of the way." Fran said hoarsely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan looked at him with surprise, "say it again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the big boxing Hearing the more firm order, he said, "Get out of the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article is the first text version of the 16k novel network. It can't be reprinted without excerpt, excerpt, and more. More recent and fastest chapters, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three bodies that were only wearing underwear and were soaked in blisters were placed in front of the police officers. The inspector stared. "It’s the 13th prisoner. Escort guards?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, identity verification is correct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coats and documents are Being taken away, the inspector had a very bad feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Apply for martial law, all patrols are dispatched, and every road is strictly investigated," the inspector said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, someone passed the blockade on-site warning line. "Are you the head of the criminal group of the General Administration of São Paulo?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you? Don't wait, please leave." The inspector does not like the tone of coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zolf Ronchi, captain of the dark police unit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢, I don't know when the secret of the dark police hall can intervene in the criminal case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know who killed them." Zall said. "The dark police hall is not sufficient in the west, and you don't have intelligence sources and cooperation, so that the case can be settled as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zall is at the border On the way, I found myself fooled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is caught in a logical misunderstanding, thinking that the goal itself is gray, middle-aged, with a mustache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can’t think about it in reverse, the swindler of the pseudonym Carl Stevens shows the appearance in front of the world, it is simply dressing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief of the station, ten ** is the goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was slammed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zall law allows the team members to continue to the border and return to the station alone. The less credit, the better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he only saw the small policeman Bran in the first aid, the judge who had become the body, and the van of the empty one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have figured out that the car is Kregan. According to the same car, a prisoner was arrested and he is preparing to take refuge in the north. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not in the north, there are only poor villages and rolling mountains." Zall said affirmatively, "If I am a fugitive, I will risk telling Outsiders, where are they going?” He took out the map and pointed his fingers at several big cities on the shoreline of the Golden Bay. “The really smart people will hide in the most prosperous places. The more people, the easier it is to hide.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
