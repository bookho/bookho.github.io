			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market is located in the tenth place outside the capital city, close to the black gold avenue. This was originally a small transfer station between the port and the capital, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but savvy wholesalers quickly discovered that they were more expensive than the urban area. The land, as long as you walk out of the city gate Shiyan, the nearby land, cheaper to send. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rent a large warehouse in the city, the monthly rent, you can build one at the transfer station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small transfer station quickly moved the building, and the warehouses of the rains came out like mushrooms after the rain. If you have money, you will build a simple bungalow. Neatly arranged in a row, outside the rough stone to build a courtyard wall, the money is less, not to be outdone, build a shed in the block, hire a few trustworthy employees guarding day and night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business people in the expensive decoration of the shop, always only sample and a small amount of spot, encounter large purchases, talk about the price, go directly to the warehouse transfer It is convenient and saves a lot of trouble. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, small traders have also come together. There are a large number of employees left behind by business people, and there are many workers who are carrying trucks to unload goods. These people have simple requirements for life. Cheap and affordable living items are right for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is learning very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it’s cutting ingredients, or observing a small piece of meat tumbling in hot oil, let it start in the most delicious time, even the meat in the meatballs The final ratio is also well mastered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Fran has a small formula that makes the cost of lunch more cheap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mint leaves and laurel leaves as flavorings are not cheap, and ordinary citizens who generally pay a fee rarely eat meat. Their staple foods are bread and fish soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that meat is hard to eat, there is no spice to remove the smell, and the boiled meat can’t cover the pungent smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But orange peel can be cheap, this wild green skin fruit has been artificially cultivated for generations, the taste is sour, no one loves to eat, only the voyage vessel Will buy a few barrels to prevent the occurrence of nightmarish sepsis at sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the port, a few copper plates can pick up a large basket of orange peel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orange peel is air-dried, baked with a small fire, cut into small pieces, mixed on the meat, the effect is not inferior to the orthodox spices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The box lunch with meat chops caused a sensation in the market. Every day at noon, the small dining car of Fran’s family was full of people, and some old customers who used to eat did not hesitate. Going far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A day, An Mei carefully counted the copper corner and the gross ticket, and earned 60 yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, the competitors in the market can’t do it anymore. Several stall owners are downcast, some are ready to find another, and some are planning to come. Yin, before they acted, Fran took the initiative to find the door. He promised to sell only one hundred lunches a day, and never monopolize the business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gentlemen, I am not afraid, the road of the patrol hall is definitely more familiar than you, but it is good for everyone, but it is good for everyone." Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At home at night, An Mei asked, "When the business is best, we can sell more than 140, so it is not a big loss? The whole market is 咱If you sell one, you can earn more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Imagine if you buy clothes, will you go to the exclusive street of the clothing store, or choose the whole article? Is there a place where the street is alone?” Fran threw the copper horn and quickly grabbed it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei has big eyes and seems to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We didn't have the money to put all the food stalls in the market. If there is only one left, it can't be supplied to everyone, so you can earn a lot in the first few days. But for a long time, when people think that it is too unreasonable to wait for a long time every day, they will find another place to eat, or there is a formal restaurant to find business opportunities to open a branch." Fran continued to explain, "the scale is formed. Profit, I would rather compete with ten booths in the most customers, and not want to monopolize a street where customers are scarce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your brain, in the end How long is it?” An Mei looked at Fran’s face for a long time with the fascinating star eyes, then laughed and pushed him to the bed, and the plump body teased like a snake. “Today’s Let's challenge it again four times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Minger wants to get up in bed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then three times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, all the vendors who supply lunches have found that the rules set by Fran are good for everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most obvious point is that you can purchase the ingredients and enjoy the benefits of wholesale discounts. Even the expensive peppers are discounted by group purchase, and the cost is reduced to an acceptable level. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flower and the same money as before, the quality of the ingredients has increased a lot, the customers of the mixed market have a good time, they are more willing to take more from the pocket A piece of copper, to let the taste buds enjoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweetness allows traders to respect the promoters, and some people began to call Fran "heads", which became popular soon. François convinced everyone to move the meal stalls together, instead of heading west at the head of the market, each specializing in specific foods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Fran is rated for the popularity of each type of food, pork chops and meatballs are first class, fish and ordinary seafood are second-rate, boring rape as a side dish And so on, it is a third-rate, try to make each booth according to good craftsmanship to a popular dish, not repeating each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, a succinct open-air food court was formed, and François Amn, inspector, obtained a wine license for the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diners have more people, and even some sailors in the port have a big happy treat, and are happy to come here to celebrate. According to them, the food taste of the port To be inferior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan plans to spend enough money, buy a piece of land, hire several chefs, open a real restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master William originally asked Fran as his full-time assistant, but carefully considered, Fran euphemistically refused, for those who have family, no day It’s not a good idea to experiment almost all night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the original dream was to be a prosecutor before the age of forty," Fran thought. "The goal now is that before the age of forty There is a chain restaurant of its own. Any road, as long as you keep going, will have a future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very confident about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three carriages approached the fee in the afternoon when the sun gradually slanted westward They stopped at the remote grove that was far from the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Igo Andech frowned unhurly, he looked at the eight thugs he brought, and asked in a loud voice, "Spout? Actually want me to wait He."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Patience, the more detailed the information, the better. After all, there is a holy warrior in the city of Feidu. Think of the old Madges who ate this loss. For the killer, a little negligence, the price is his own life." Answering Igo is an unusually burly person, the collar turned high, people can only know his forehead and curly hair. From the waist of the muddy dagger and the thick sole of the sole, he is also an assassin, few assassins will be so high, the shorter the person, the easier it is to sneak in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is either a rookie who doesn't know how to choose a career, or a master in this line. Obviously he belongs to the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's right, if you are with you that day, I don't have to show up and be humiliated." Igo lowered his anger slightly, by the way, appreciated. The tall man is the ace of the Igo Andech gang. No, except for the assassin, he has a more mysterious identity. For a long time, even Igo, who is the head, is not willing to sin easily. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, a horseman came to the woods. He rolled over and stopped, and before he could gasp, he was caught in the throat by Igo. "You know that it was wasted." Whose time?" he muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...Head...the two of them are separated today...separated." The spy’s face was purple, and Igo’s hand was loose, and he squatted half. He coughed on the ground, his tears came out, and he finally recovered. When he saw his head change because of his inability to change his face, the spy shuddered and hurriedly replied, "The prosecutor has been fired and has been with his wife." Doing small business outside the city, today, the prosecutor is still in the market, but the stinky girl stays at home. I ran on both sides, so I delayed the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ig knocked on his teeth and decided. "Joe Corleone, you take three people to the city, remember, don't even leave the mouse in the room, the rest go with me to the market."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe Corleone, the tall assassin, the bow that hides under the collar seems to smile. "I am enough." He untied the reins tied to the horse and jumped up, Yang. Whip, the running horse is caught by the thick thighs, always giving the illusion that it seems that the rider is dragging the horse under his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is always so arrogant." Igor burst into tears, although Joe is not as respectful as others, but this little thing does not affect the gang leader trust this The loyalty of the subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, guys." The gangster clap his hands, "I will be happy, don't play him so fast, I want him to suffocate." There is no good meat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran’s residence is at least one The 30-story two-story building is located in the alley of the old district back street. Like most houses in the old district, it is of wooden structure, without a basement or terrace. Well, maybe there was a terrace 20 years ago. On the wall outside the second floor window, you can see the residual wooden piles and the rusted black nails, which are rotten and rough, and can barely provide the function of sheltering from wind and rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the obstruction of the houses on both sides, it is difficult to see the sun, the people are scarce, and only a few houses are rented out, and the tenants are also Workers who sell hardships usually return home when the sun is completely down. Sometimes they are busy, and it is common to not come back for two or three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a corner that has been forgotten by the city. It is a bit bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe is very satisfied with this, he does not have to wait until late at night, the prey is only a woman, one of them is old, right, and there is a dog . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the object of murder does not conform to Joe’s morality, the task is the task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy's gray iris smeared a trace of green awn, the shadow of the back alley of the whole alley seemed to be called by some kind of power, and began to appear like a water surface The ripples of the circle and the ripples of the ripples became more and more fierce. In the end, the black waves of one person were raised, and the body of Joe was wrapped up. Gradually, the waves were calm, and the killer disappeared without a trace. It dissolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a unique human being in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can tell where these people have inherited the most mysterious blood, so that they do not need to learn arcane, do not understand God's grace, they can master some incredible skills, people use the legendary power The monsters come to call them: Dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you reveal it yourself, even the Prophet Master can't tell, in the end who is the Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blood is the blessing of heaven, unpredictable, as if the gods will throw a gold coin into the world, as to who will be shackled, it can only be attributed to luck and more Supernatural factor. A dragon squad strictly trains the scorpion, and it cannot let the descendants inherit it. And a country farmer who complains too much weeds in the field will unconsciously let the blood appear, creating a strange plague between the minds, letting all The grass that robbed the wheat nutrients withered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe Corleone was a thief who made a living by plagiarism when he was a child. He didn’t have the qualifications in this area, he always lost his hand and beat him up. I can't steal the daily quota. When I return to the nest at night, I have to smack the thief's head, and often I don't even have to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time he went to the streets, using the scarred hand to unravel the pockets of passers-by, he muttered, "You can't see me, you can't see." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there was a cloudy afternoon, at the door of a shop, he stared at a fat man who had just pushed the door out, his pockets, he Back in the past, carefully hit the button on the pocket, just put your fingers in, the fat man seems to notice what, holding his hand in his pocket, keep looking around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The younger pre-feeling was beaten, he didn’t have the strength to escape, just ran two steps, his legs were straight and soft, he could only kneel in the corner, his hands clasped his head, hoping to be shackled You can escape this disaster in two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can't see me, it's fine." Joe thought desperately, fearing that his teeth would tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty strangely touched his head, the store clerk put his head out of the counter, "Sir, what's the matter with you, need help?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought I had a thief, but no one even saw it." The fat man replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, no one really, the illusion." The clerk said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They really can't see Joe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that day, Joe Corleone got the best friend, as long as he was in the shadow, he was the omnipotent god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the underground world, an assassin who can be completely invisible in the shadows, let all the impossible trembles tremble with fear, the shadowwalker Corleone, is every A nightmare that an individual cannot escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei was in a fever, and it rained a little rain two days ago, so that some overdrafted body quickly broke down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl took some medicine in the morning and was always sleepy. She was half-sleeping and awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran wanted to accompany her, but she was rejected by the girl. "I took a medicine and went to sleep. It’s okay, you don’t have a booth today, the future. The chain restaurant will earn two bricks less."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a sound of the cup being shattered downstairs, probably the grandmother didn’t take it, Anmei Stupidly thought, she wanted to get up and clean up, but she was boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Jack "Wang Wang" called a few times, then very sad and snorted, "That stupid dog, was sharded to the leg?" Mei struggled halfway on the pillow and shook his head, trying to get himself back to life, ready to go downstairs to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just sitting on the edge of the bed, putting shoes on his feet, the girl’s body suddenly stiffened, and the eyelids kept jumping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inexplicable, continually feeling like a heavy object oppressed her from breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bedroom door was closed and there was no strange noise, but she felt that something extremely dangerous was standing outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling seems to have appeared once before, right, three years ago in the winter, the night of the pigeons being released by Fran. At that time, the tavern was just snoring, and when he got off work late at night, he was followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the horror of that day is far from the present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei cried, tears kept flowing, she didn’t know why she was afraid, why did she cry, but she couldn’t stop it, she held the quilt and trembled The bed moved slightly, the girl wanted to shout, shouted grandmother's name, called the puppy Black Jack, but the real nightmare made her brain and tongue become stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the outside of the door? Where is Grandma?" An Mei thought, she stared straight at the bedroom door, and did not dare to look away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the line of sight, the door becomes blurred and transparent. If it disappears into the air, is it the cause of tears? But who is the tall figure in front of the door? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fran, you must not come back now." An Mei is desperate, she seems to understand a little, this feeling, only when her life is in danger Will appear, reminding her to be careful about the call of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe Corleone’s keen senses have detected the situation in the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was surprised that in the material, the prey was just an ordinary woman who was born, but she seemed to have already felt what was going to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More surprised things happened later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ice cubes dissolved under the raging sun, Joe still blends with the shadows, showing the half body of the emptiness, resisted by the shadows, the shoulders of the left body, Arms, legs, a little bit, peeled off from the shadow. No matter how he summoned, he could not get a shadow response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it?" Joe kicked the door very rudely, he guessed it, the girl who was tired of lying in bed, saw strangers break in and made a miserable tip Called, the tears in the corners of the eyes, painted a trace of water on the face that was distorted by fear, but in any case, it was impossible to cover up the two eyes with green eyes and barely visible pupils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The new dragons!" Joe thought, and is also the natural enemy of the assassin, able to foresee the danger and the ability to detect the source of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some mediocrity who seem to be inactive, in the life and death can stimulate the power hidden in the deepest part of the blood, but Joe did not expect that this part of the million The chance of one will meet today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assassin Master is hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei did not know where to get the courage, throwing the pillow to the killer, and even fleeing downstairs to escape downstairs, Joe instinctively reached out, only need Two fingers can pinch the other's throat, and when he touches the girl, he stops moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small living room on the first floor was a mess. Grandma fell on the back of a large pool of blood. Black Jack was nailed to the wall by the kitchen knife. The tail was still shaking, and the tail was still shaking slightly. An Mei fell on her grandmother and shouted wildly. With. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murderer followed step by step, walked down the stairs, and looked at the hysterical woman with a very strange look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is Miss Anmei? What happened? I came in." Al Duna smells a bouquet of delicate roses, dressed in a decent, he I haven't given up yet, thinking about the hardships of the past few months should make the girl lose her childish thoughts of pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams heard outside the house made him feel that it was a great opportunity. Maybe I am quarreling with Fran and marrying the damn guy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is rich, such as the savior who appears to save Cinderella's prince, and the other is a hawker who sells box lunches at the market. The person is out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as it’s not a fool, you know how to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You took my position, I will take away your woman, not to mention that the girl is really beautiful." Ayr sinisterly laughed and pushed away Cover the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body and killer in the house made the hopeful Chief Justice stunned, and he quickly stopped in front of the girl. "Who are you?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ayre is confident in his own skills, and swordsmanship is a compulsory course for every aristocratic family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the small circle, no one is his opponent, although there is no sword, but the crutches can also come in handy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe Flair offended the hooligans of Feidu and was devastated, oh, I like this ending, and then accept your woman by the way." I think that although the hero saves the United States, although it is old-fashioned, it is worth a try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayre puts the most prestige posture, "I am the official of the thirteenth court, Dunawen, which gang is your gang? Mouse Pace is still Knife, little Jimmy?" He scornfully said the names of several rogue heads. "Even your head sees me all respectfully, don't hurry out."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words saved his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Duna Wen? The Feidu family, which is close to the gorse, if it kills him, it may bring disadvantages to the alliance." Joe in a flash Turn the dagger over and knock it out with a knife handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is holding her grandmother, her voice hoarse and whispering, and her voice has no focus. The fear has made her in a state of disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill her?" Qiao Sisuo, "No, it’s better to let her live. It won’t take long for all the killers in the underground world to relearn. Sneak, except myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hypnosis and brainwashing are not too difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woods, the soil filled with decaying leaves, greedily absorbed Stars are bright red liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hours of abuse, Fran Flair’s painful organs were numb, his blood was blurred, his body was constantly pumping, and he had stopped bleeding. The wound was quickly slashed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few places, you can already see the reddish bones, even the corpse of the cemetery is better than his current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Igo. Andech is happily wandering around the head, watching Fran crawling a little on the ground with his bare fingers, "Escape Point, man. So slow, you can catch up soon." He slammed his feet from time to time, admiring the blood spray from the terrible wounds, mixed with red granules and damaged skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan couldn’t move, the eyelids were getting heavier and heavier, and the messenger of the Lord was on his way, not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear, climb again, if I can climb out of the woods, I will let you go." Igo licked his lips, excited and flushed, he Turning Fran face into the sky and stepping on the chest a few times, suddenly, Fran's mouth and nose poured a lot of bloody blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a symbol of the rib piercing the lungs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
