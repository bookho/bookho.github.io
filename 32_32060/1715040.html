			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The panic brought by the Assassin disappeared without a trace. At this time, the entire upper class of Tantin was in an excited and busy atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-awaited royal wedding ceremony was not affected by the assassin’s incident. According to outside rumors, the body of His Royal Highness has improved, which makes people once again admire the healing The magic of medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Fran’s heart is clear, and Peggy’s health is very bad. Just like the death row in the prison, the law still does not deprive the prisoner of his right to exist until the gallows are opened. He deliberately suppressed the time of the Holy Power treatment, but simply pulled Peggy back from the death line, stopped serious internal bleeding, and expelled the toxins. However, it is not his responsibility to cure those sequelae together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the half-month period, the muscle organs damaged by the knife and poison are not so easy to recover naturally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to eliminate the uneasiness of the citizens, Peggy was in high-profile appearance in front of the public after a week of recuperation. She accepted two newspaper reporters in a few days. Visited and returned to the Justice Department to handle some trivial matters and attended a banquet of a prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is also the guest of the prince. He had deliberately asked Peggy at the banquet. "I have seen Mr. Longchi in the Justice Department. It's hard to imagine that he would do such a bad deed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can hardly believe it." Peggy said bluntly. "Now the world is rumored. Because my attitude towards the secretary is too bad, causing him to lose his sense of reason. Although Zolfa Lonchi’s personality is disgusting, he is not a crazy disorder.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think people can be wrong, just like you are a smart person worth mentioning. When I get to Longchi, I have to ask him exactly what happened.” Peggy smiled softly and reached out from the passing attendant and took a glass of red wine, but this move affected the wound that had not healed. Missy bit her teeth and her face was white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The potion potion. It can't be tested to make such a serious injury, completely recovered in just a few days, you should rest more." Fran notice It’s a painful look to Peggy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, anyway, it hurts, what happened, it will still happen, it is better to finish early." Peggy groaned and suddenly asked. "When you came to visit the palace, have you seen my father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Think how he is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Duke is a tough, awesome object."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, he always likes to raise his head and fear, because the person who wants to stand above him, from the spirit to the **, has been wiped out."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last paragraph was very light, such as the breeze through the gallery, the whispering sound, so that Fran could not understand. But he looked from Peggy. A certain expression that is fleeting. Guess what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to be very tired, don't bother you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, right No matter whether it is me, or the gorse or the royal family, it will not be expressed to those who lend a helping hand in times of crisis. The reward is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran shrugged and didn't care. After he left, he walked toward the position of Finance Minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that I am right and wrong. As a neutral businessman, the relationship with political parties is well handled, but who knows what will happen tomorrow? Change the situation." He thought as he walked, "have to control the troubles, such as Zolfa Lungi, such as Ma Tida..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but fortunate Disasters are the grace and jokes of the gods, not the wisdom of the world. Can be mastered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain of the glory, the shadow of the clouds in the sky, after all, was blown away by the brisk wind, this is the true inner portrayal of Lila Berry at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl sang the minor tune of her hometown slang and swam in the courtyard. In addition to her hair style, she wore a white nursing hat, carrying a basket of clothes, walking to a row of bamboo poles, using a fingertip to rub the sheets on the bamboo poles, soft sunlight in the afternoon, invading It is very comfortable to touch in the granules of cloth and cotton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded with satisfaction, pushed her feet up, pulled the sheets down, grabbed a corner with her chin, folded her hands pleasingly, and put them in the basket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of sparrows were stunned by the girl’s pace, then fell not far away and jumped on the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grab the sparrow, but Lila’s masterpiece, when she was a child, she often used a bit of breadcrumbs and clams to make a trap, adding a fried small dish to the dinner recipe. poultry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if the girl likes to eat. I have a chance to catch a few." Lila thought, she was born in a country town, she could not understand The so-called nutritious meal in the sanatorium, the oil should be placed as little as possible, the matching of the haloin must be reasonable, and even the specific concentration of the soymilk is clearly defined. The menu shows the various daily doses of nutrients, and the string of numbers looks like a financial report for accounting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have never eaten such troublesome food, it is not healthy." She grinned. "All day in the room, half step is not coming out." If you are ill, you will become sick."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lila finds a new job for a caregiver, she comes to the nursing home and sees Marty at first sight. When I arrived, I liked and sympathized with this lady like a porcelain doll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a very beautiful girl, but she doesn’t laugh, sitting at the table next to the window sill, occasionally holding a colored pencil and smearing it on the paper. Anyone who can't understand the pattern, more often, is in a daze. Huanren did not have a focal length through the printed curtains, looking at the distance, the woods on the hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a warm sun, as if it is not able to expel the atmosphere of cold and ash, Lila will have an illusion every time he cleans the room, this decoration is luxurious, even Under the mattress are small spring-sized bedrooms, like a prison with invisible cages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leila does not understand medical terms such as "autism" and "congenital brain hypoplasia", but she feels that for health, the sun Grassland is more effective than a hundred pills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking for opportunities, I should tell the head nurse that it is more effective to exercise in the wild than to be quiet." Lila puts the basket in her arms. Thinking while walking, at this time, she suddenly saw the goalkeeper pulling the iron gate, a tall man, dressed in a big man, riding a horse, galloping in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
