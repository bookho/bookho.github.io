			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The bank staff passing by in front of the office, all listened to the roar of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that Double Eagle Bank is in trouble and has trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All bankers will never pay interest and lock the customer’s deposit in the drawer. If there are 10 million Caesars on hand, then at least 8 million of them are invested or lending, and the cash that can be paid at any time on the books is always a minority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop the panic, for the banker, it is undoubtedly a financial black death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feidu Branch is currently infected with this plague, unidentified bankruptcy rumors spread in the Gulf region, and more than a dozen rich people are busy selling bank bonds After the matter was revealed, it triggered a new round of panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are long queues in front of the bank, and well-informed people are scrambling to withdraw money. The team of hundreds of people surprised every passerby, and the news of the inquiries was spread by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, even small traders with only a hundred blocks of deposits have kept their deposit receipts, fearing that the bank will declare a bankruptcy before it is their turn to withdraw money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the cash in the small business halls in the surrounding towns was exhausted, then several medium-sized cities in the Gulf region, and finally, the headquarters of the Bay Branch in Feidu, only Desperately let the cash trucks wait in the backyard, and their money is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are thousands of people gathered in the square, pushing away for a hundred---for a long time, the original designer, did not expect hundreds of years later, when it was exceptionally broad The streets, because of the dramatic increase in population, have become overcrowded. The construction of a new street is very resistant. In the city, if you take two steps, you will encounter a famous building that has left an impact or anecdote in history. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alchemist and the engineering scientist finally came up with a compromise method, using the method of digging piles and mines, to create artificial roads in the underground of Tantin City. Let the carriage divert to relieve the pressure on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no eternal light, the lamp with permanent light can expel dark, hard cement mixed with curing agent, can support the wall of the tunnel, total investment Six million is expected to be completed within two years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it does, the official will be promoted nationwide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experimental point chosen is the Bull Street in the East District of Augustus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investor will have ten years of ownership after the completion of the project and charge the carriage using the tunnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investment consultant of Double Eagle Bank, through detailed road and person flow analysis, believes that the maintenance fund will be removed, and at least two million net profits will be generated in ten years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private friendship between Elro and the Finance Minister has enabled him to firmly seize this government-related project, but now he can only give up . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Bo is also interested in the tunnel project. It is better to give him the cheaper than the bell bank. I am currently owed a favor to the Knights." Elro thought about the content of the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a week, under the withdrawal of the Double Eagle Bank and the care of the Finance Minister, Fran signed a formal contract with the authorities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take out six million, for Fran, it is no small burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But because the project lasts for two years, the previous period only needs one million investment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, your vision is absolutely correct, this is a good deal." The official who signed with him said, "But this is related to public safety, all The quality of the project, the official will check at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Fran answered. He looked at the plan provided by the authorities, and there was a huge spider web lurking in the depths of the earth. "For the progress of the project, I need a construction map of the sewer."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is natural, we will provide all convenience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tunnel of Bull Street? No, that is not his purpose. Fran is preparing to dig out the small-shaped passage leading to all directions while constructing the carriage tunnel. This kind of trail, which is only intended to accommodate several people at the same time, is not difficult to dig, and it will cover all important locations in the city after being connected to Tantin's underground waterway. As long as the staff is drawn from the gangs in the Golden Bay, confidentiality is not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
