			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. In the beautiful sister of Loli and the blonde, entangled in the unclear and unclear emotions, Fran Fryer leaned on the leather On the squat seat, the car parked in the back of the hills, the clear sky is extraordinarily blue, the silky clouds are moving lazily, nature never shows its beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter; the thoughts of joy, distress, joy, sadness, love, and hate; the self-discipline and indulgence of moral construction The fall of the people, whether from the external senses or the inner small world, is rich and varied and varied. From the moment of birth, people face a choice of questions: the housewife is thinking , eat stew or fried fish tonight? The small staff is thinking, should I quit to another company? The same treatment, but more promising, love is in depression, she and her, two girls, who is more suitable for me? Are the soldiers on the battlefield making choices, escaping or fighting? In a drama that people can enjoy, there is also a sad cry:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Survival or destruction? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the time and life of Fran, already solidified on the day four years ago, was stagnant in the dark and invisible season. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no choice but to go forward, even in the mud of hatred, sinking into insidious, barbaric, cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the commandments that are stuck in the bottom of my heart, he has long been different from the freshman in the judiciary full of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has only one thought to destroy the woman’s arrogant career, cut off the family’s leafy roots, let the punishable sin, pile the grave , choose a location for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe we can talk calmly." Julies, who was released from the ban of the coffin, was under the supervision of the gunman. Slowly tearing the bread in his hand, he wiped off the breadcrumbs on his hands and shouted at Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now there is no common topic between me and you." The Avengers replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, about Peggy." Julius whispered without retreat. "Maybe in your eyes. I am a mad patient, poor." The meat ticket, but it does not mean that I am a fool. What you do is not out of greed for money, nor for me personally, nor is it a madman of **, otherwise you can do it more despicable, that is, Revenge, the word can be explained. So I imagine that your goal is my wife, perhaps the family behind her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran picked up his eyebrows. In his impression, Chu Jun was a gentle, scholarly, young man who was far away from conspiracy and tricks. He could speculate on this step when the news was blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good reasoning. If I said yes, what would you do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Trading, release me. And stop the plot against Peggy and converge on your sinful mind.” Julius still doesn’t know the news that his father is dying, he promised, “I will advise the father to try to get rid of Rein The Shiman family has too strong ambitions and has never been guilty of your crimes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you also hate the gorse?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am just for my wife, Peggy is a good girl, but the girl of the wealthy family will inevitably make some sins involuntarily, so please don't hate her. We will weaken Leinschmann into An ordinary aristocratic family. It is in the interest of the royal family to get rid of this pitiful predicament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Chu Jun is full of honey-like tenderness "Oh, so we have a common language, you can save a lot of trouble, and will not hurt more innocent people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; In Julius's mind, his precious wife is only a puppet manipulated by the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sentimental and simple people, Fran sighed and thought. The crown prince does not lack the depth of intellectuality, nor is it an idiot with a deformed IQ. But the kind nature makes him unable to recognize the true face of others hiding behind the fake face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, how can he treat a cold-blooded woman as a weak lamb? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A puppet involuntarily?" Fran sneered with a chuckle, "What kind of grace to create something can create a woman who is as determined and determined as her?" Destroy this arrogant arrogant woman, and it really makes people feel happy from the bone marrow. Please believe, soon, you will feel this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Julius's eyes are full of fear, as if the devil came from the abyss, ready to take away his most beloved things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a worthy demon!" he snarled angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If only darkness can engulf the darkness, then, I am a devil, what's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fulan whispered, "This is blood and soul, give me advice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No feminine femininity, live like an energetic Cold-blooded workaholics, sharp-minded and intelligent, but with a kind of brutal aggression, arrogant, unruly, arrogant, self-righteous, have the whole world, and compare others to uncultivated lower animals, why the Highness will be obsessed with this woman... ... If the names of the ladies in the private circle of Byron are summed up, we can harvest a lot of mean words, they look at Peggy and look forward to her when she is in the bottom of my heart. Falling from the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggie, who is burdened with many ladies’ resentment, never disdains the hostility of others. She is 26 years old and is at the age of the woman’s goldenest. She is of noble origin. Perfect as a sculptured face, an envied husband, who controls the private forces that can't allow Xiaokai, she can make the person who hates her become miserable, and make the person who loves her rich and powerful. Her forehead does represent The extraordinary crown of sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she is qualified to be arrogant, and has the money to enjoy the worship of ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the saying goes, "There is also a time when the gods are sneezing." Missy is irritating at this moment, and she swears harshly from the red lips, she asks. "Is it an attack? The so-called mysterious dragons, but like the hunter-only escaping, are you escaping?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public disease Heavy, the family is eager to move, the political situation is surging, everyone is going to make ghosts again, what a good opportunity, she can completely suppress the father’s ambition by using the position that Chu Jun can not be moved, and then slowly record the power of the gorse Pushing her husband to the front desk, he controls the power of the entire empire behind the scenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s all because of the troublesome kidnappers and the fragile little mad husband who made her planned arrangements messed up and forced to return to Tantin. The rights center, but also have to worry about becoming a weaker position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She patted the floor of the carriage with the bottom of the boot and continued to swear. "The outpost's scout was attacked. I couldn't get the layout and intelligence of the trading location. Joe Kao Is Leon's proud dragons all in paper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She held her hair with her fingers in a depressed mood. I just want to find someone to slap a few slaps. "Casimodo is not around, you have to protect me personally, and the rest of the people are all a bunch of waste and vats!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp &丽安 looked worriedly at the sorrowful Peggy, in the mind of the little maid who was around the waiter, her mistress never knew what to fear, and used all kinds of wrists gracefully and viciously. Killing trouble in the cradle has the highest realm that a woman can achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the private intelligence and the maid instinctively said that a series of accidents that occurred when Chu Jun was kidnapped seemed to be directed at the owner, but not in detail. The evidence gave her a slap in the face, the girl got up, took out the glass from the closet of the car, and used the juice and several flavors of pure wine to make the hostess a light cocktail with a beautiful color. I hope a cold liquid. Can calm her anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a pouring of the wine, and Missy slowly exhaled the tone with a slight alcohol, trying to stretch the tight eyebrows. Being angry and angry, but indulging in meaningless venting, without any help to the predicament, Peggy is always a woman who knows the more important, the more she must remain calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am probably in the medically ovulated period, and it is easy to become impatient." She laughed at herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You really don't want to change the plan, meet with the kidnappers?" Julian cautiously raised her own worries, now it is 1:00 pm, before night, Lightly loaded carriages must arrive at the agreed location. "I am worried that this is a trap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if it is a trap, I have to take a trip. I only have one weakness, that is, I am known by others, Julius The illness, and then the Presbyterian House took away his inheritance, which led me to be involved, so that I could no longer approach Byron’s supreme authority. So, either he could hold him firmly in his palm, or he would have to Completely wiped out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bluntly tells the words of the big rebellion. Let Yan Li’s eyes wide open, the little maid squatted for a moment and bowed her head respectfully. “I promise that even if there is a despicable trap, I will ensure your safety.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ray of sunshine, projected through the gaps of the window curtains, the moisture makes the floor slightly convex, the blood that has not yet solidified, slowly flowing along the slope of a small land, a potted decoration with evergreen potted plants Falling down the hallway, the broken tiles and the mud splashed all over the floor, and there were a few green and small broken leaves gently swirling in the pool of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excitement of people’s conversations is like the sound of summer humming, the dozens of firearms soldiers and senior agents are searching in the building, with a strict attitude. It seems that even the potential gap between the floors, I have to kneel down and study it carefully, in an attempt to find any clues left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zolfan Lonchi took off his coat indifferently and threw it away. The double-breasted gray woolen coat was contaminated with blood and white flowers. The brains, this is the early moment, a good dragon pulse, broke through the surrounding net, when he rushed over, he was caused by a close-range gun with a broken brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and tied the curtain to one side, and opened the window to reduce the strong bloody smell in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the outside, this is a comfortable country farmhouse, very common in Byron, usually a villa renovated by some rich peasants, with white painted wood Fences and cobblestone artificial trails, behind the house with barns and stables, and about three acres of land, because it is not the planting season, the land is temporarily abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blitz operation has just ended. The opponents are the two battalion's musketeers, one row of cavalry and local police, while the other is six. A dragon assassin belonging to a mysterious organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the power is clear at a glance, the six unlucky ones are now lying under the crumpled brown plastic corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the informant of Chengcheng, this is the first gift that Zall Law gave to Kufu Von Tver, and is also a necessary step to gain trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Fran’s plan, with the help of the power of the authorities, the underground arming of Peggy was weakened as much as possible, and the Missy was considered to be a trouble. And Joe Corleone also felt that the stocks could not be exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more importantly, to promote the prince’s eagerness to move, anyone who has mastered authority can’t forget the sweetness brought by the power. Struggling, he could not tolerate the jinque's step by step, one hand covering the sky, but not confident enough to rely on the forces in his hands to cope with the union of the great aristocratic group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
