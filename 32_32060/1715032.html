			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The door was slammed open, and the floor rubbed sharply, breaking the nearly solid air in the hall, and the appearance of the court mages made people feel Surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berry Rothie disgustedly squinted at Bishop Roland, Austrian law and magic, this is an opposite school that does not look good to each other, the former pays attention to personal qualifications It is believed that magic is a tool that is commanded and manipulated by human beings; while the latter puts everything under the sacred faith and the sacred aura. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He guessed from the crowd’s expression that the situation did not improve, so he quickly walked to Julius’s side and whispered, “The lieutenant has not left. Danger? Does magic work not work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius paled, for a long time, nodded desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed, God's grace is superior to the Austrian law in the field of treatment, but it does not mean that it is omnipotent." Bury is just enough to let others Hearing the voice, he solemnly said, "I don't know the bishop, have you ever heard of potions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland crosses his chest and his eyebrows are tight Wrinkle, "The potion of the shaman's potion? It was a hundred years ago, it was a school that was lost, dirty, and awkward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the Holy See In the eyes, everything except the holy city of Anno is unclean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berry Coconut shrugged his shoulders, "Magic Pharmacy, Fundamentally, the branch belonging to alchemy can be explained by the concept of plastic energy and enchantment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But why do you mention it?" Roland is obviously not willing to continue to argue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two hours ago, I officially met a gentleman who has studied the magic potion. In the case that both grace and medical skills are not effective, I feel that You should try the curative effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please allow me to take the liberty to ask." The Director of the Security Agency’s Gould Frye seems to be under pressure from the spurs It seems to be a cup of snake shadow, and as everyone knows, not long ago, he had a little unpleasant little thing with the Chu, very likely. As a result, he will become a scapegoat and be kicked out of politics by political opponents. He cautiously asked, "As the bishop said, it is a school that has been lost for hundreds of years. It is hard to believe that when we are at a loss, it just happens to be in front of us. It is a scam..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gentleman's mentor is a master of alchemy who is familiar with me. It is not to be false." And Bury looked around. "Many people at the venue know him."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius's eyes rekindled the spark of hope, "Who is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Casimo Lord Dolby. "The courtmaster replied, "He is preparing the pharmacy, and then he will arrive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a delicate and delicate oriental thin porcelain bottle. Like a translucent sapphire. Gently spread the luster. The wall of the bottle is as thin as the wings of the fly, as if it were in the hand, as long as it is slightly exerted. It will break open. The stoppers that are even blocked are made of the most beautiful emerald floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the light, you can faintly see that there is a small half bottle of light blue sticky paste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the potion that can come back to life?" Julius took the bottle trembled. Although he didn't know anything about potions, it was worth the money. On the container, it adds a little confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As I mentioned before, I have traveled in the East for several years as an adventurer. This medicine is what I got in an adventure." Fran answered, "I must have praised Master Berry Roche for admiring my mastery of refining potions, but people must be loyal. For the potions, I am just a beginner."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you ensure its effectiveness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan’s tone is very heavy, “It’s too much to say that it’s too old to say, it’s after all The field of the gods. But it has a magical effect on serious injuries. At least six times. It is this bottle of medicine that took me back from the land of the lord, which is why it is only a little left. Apprentices who are interested in Potions, I wanted to keep it, experiment, and study the detailed formula, but obviously, the knowledge it contains is something I can't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berry agrees to nod. "The history of magic can be summed up in ancient times, those legends The legendary spells are also beyond the reach of our masters. Perhaps the product of this potion is in that distant age. Compared with the Arcane, Shen En is still a child who is not yet dry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many ancient records, magic has indeed appeared hundreds of years earlier than magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the presence of the Archbishop's ground, showing off the long-standing heritage of Austrian law, and the incompetence of the declining magic is the most willing thing for every mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s face was ironed up from the chair. “Since the magic is not used, then I will leave.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is keeping him, everyone is staring at the vial containing the magical ointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope it works, let Peggy wake up." Julius took a deep breath. "Please try it, as long as she can recover." I am willing to seal you as the Earl of Byron, plus a rich land in the south."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This promise immediately whispers to others, the champions of the emperor The eyes of Fulan are cast into the eyes of the people; the hospices belonging to the old party are easily apprehended to the Crown Prince and feel unhappy. A new count is not in their interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan smirked and refused, "Is the title of the Earl comparable to the chance of saving a life in times of danger? Please believe that this is entirely from Friendship, and respect for the royal family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reply is unexpected, and the members of the upper class of Tantin know the Englishman Generous, but did not expect that he was so generous to such a point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The politician of the old road, speculating that he may have another picture, but in the eyes of the crown prince, Quasimodo Bo Knight is already extraordinary. saint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ward of the St. De Charity Hospital is very narrow, thick curtains, blocking the sun in the west, leaving the bed, a woman in a coma, shrouded in a dead In the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her face is bloodless, pale and scary, her closed lips, showing a sick blue, only the slightest nose, and intermittent breathing Shows that she is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
