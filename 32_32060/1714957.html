			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ping, false, rhythm of the lines, body movements, how to express the emotions of the characters in the play, to train a professional actor, after a long study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bird squad is not a professional, and it is enough to basically perform the character of the character in the drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your pronunciation is very good, but lacks affection, dry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Action More coincident, according to the rhythm of the music to determine whether the body language is fierce or dull."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barui directed Fran, she is preparing to adapt a previously popular script Very simple revenge, but with a plot in front, the handsome knight was cursed by the evil wizard and turned into an ugly geek to meet Fran's appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran’s memory is very good, and the lines are familiar after two times, which saves a lot of things and gives him more time to practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afternoon will be done in the afternoon, and Nicole will hear a wink. In the market, except for a circus that just arrived, there is nothing else. The troupe came to compete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means a good opportunity to make money, as long as Fran can play a role; as long as the audience can accept a ugly person to star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tent was set up overnight, and the next day, the Cardinals were rehearsed, and the whole show was arranged in the morning. In the afternoon, the key story was picked** Part, practice repeatedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ending is that the Cavaliers fell in a pool of blood, picked up by the lover, kissed affectionately, and then the Cavaliers woke up in the kiss, Nicole never complained that Fran was good. Heavy, so ugly faces still have to kiss, they all know that this troupe can survive and develop, it will be tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran was not able to adapt at first, but he quickly understood that the performance, in fact, and his in the courtroom, with awkward tricks and expressions, to dig The trap, let the prisoner fall into the same, in the court, he wants to deceive the lawyer and the suspect; on the stage, he wants to fool the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers, once, he often used exaggerated language and expressions to confuse everyone and let the criminals relax their vigilance, and not long ago, he also pretended to be a nobleman. , cheated a large sum of money from the enemy, let the enemy ruin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully summarized, this is all acting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole day, they are in a state of high concentration of spirits, constantly discussing how to make up for mistakes and loopholes in the performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the end of the script, the knight changes back to its original shape because of the pure kiss of the lover. But what do we do? Or weird, the audience will not accept it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, use the smoke screen, remember that we have a few colored smoke bombs for the stage effect, and the end is made."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not suitable for Fran's clothing. He is too big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Change the script, the knight has been wearing a large cloak for his appearance Now, it’s too urgent to be a cloak.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, everyone was exhausted, even when they were eating, they didn’t have the strength to chat, fell on the bed, and soon I fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn Fort’s market day, of course, can’t be with Carnival In contrast, the folks and residents of the surrounding manor have brought some local products to the market, and the merchants who purchased them also came here by horse-drawn carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No time to advertise, send flyers, Cardinals are only free on the first day, the first day is often the least profitable, only people talk about buying and selling, When you deal with good things, you have the time to watch the drama, so the last three days are the main source of income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the word of mouth on the first day is very important. If the response is not good, no one will look at it in the next few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free or attractive, there are a lot of people in the big tent, even the hawkers who are stalling nearby, see no customers coming to the door, but also crowded to the door to watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to go to the Dawn Fort Market?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;芜荽, sage, rose Aroma and thyme,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of a girl there, hello,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She used to be my lover..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very popular poem, which is subtly changed here, turning the place name in the poem into Dawn Fort. To please the local townspeople.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw the ugly ones coming out from behind the scenes, the audience was surprised. Originally, they thought it was the troupe used for the troupe. But, not long after, people are up, they are the protagonists, and they play the role of a knight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is standing on the stage, a little nervous, always pay attention to the stage The next reaction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole’s presence calmed down the discussion, the beautiful girl attracted the attention of the audience, but after Fran’s appearance, the discussion started again. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did this troupe do it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two do not match, the knight is this virtue, I can also play." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shirt worn by Fran was soaked, and his palm was sweating. "Calm, how about it, and the play is finished." "Nike can see that he is not right, suggesting him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; took a deep breath, in the voice of the chaos, Fran suppressed the distracting thoughts. Serious performance, the knight, who experienced the most terrible sufferings, still adheres to virtue, and walks on the road full of thorns, such as the boundless darkness, the faint, but never extinguished glory.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has completely entered the role, no more snoring in the ears, no first time as the protagonist, he is fascinated in the story.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am tired of sighing, attacked by sorrow, trapped in the enemy's strategy, the enemy forces my soul, wants to expel me into the darkness, Lord, please make them fear Let them know that they are just people. He muttered the lines, the appearance of the enemies, emerged, condescending, and smiled ironically at him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let them know, but they It is human. Fran looked up at Peggy, the head of the gang, the shining gorse, "...you, but people." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Nicole glared at him, Fran was awakened, the hallucination disappeared, and the whole tent was silent, at first it was a person, then It’s two or three, everyone is clapping, some ladies, still crying.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
