Fran is wondering, this purse is well-made, The material is also expensive cloth. It seems that the kidnappers don't care, and they will be seen by the people who care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the yellow-brown walnut flower, the emblem of the Darmack family." Paris smiled miserably, "a baron family in the west of Byron." Perhaps in the eyes of the big man, it is not worth mentioning, but in the eyes of my poor mother, the baron is already a very big master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's very simple The ethical drama, in a noble manor, as a maid's young girl, and her master went to bed, although the other is a 60-year-old man, but the gorgeous clothes, exquisite diet, the servant's envious eyes, let The girl felt that the deep wrinkles on the old man's face were smooth and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a mistake. Everyone wants to live better and work harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that she miscalculated her charm. Not long after, the tired Dalmark Baron sent her a few small sums. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the girl, after abandoning herself for a while, found that she was pregnant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can say clearly, the flesh and blood in this belly is the flowering of the baron old tree, or the legacy of a man in the days of self-destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Paris Dalmark." The girl gave the child the name. She is like a madman, and announces to everyone that this is the blood of the baron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After childhood, Paris is not beautiful, there are many small white spots on the cheeky cheeks, the baron does not admit, let one not Know the origins. In the future, there will be no ugly daughter who marries the value of other families, to divide his family property. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Paris was four years old, the baron, which could not be tolerated, drove her and her mother out of the manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother always cursed and cursed, "A thing that is not worthy of sorrow, if you grow beautiful again, maybe the lord will be merciful." Give me an identity..." Then she psychedelically portrayed that in the castle, even the blanket on the ground was cleaner than the current bed. On the wall of the corridor, there was an art that she didn’t understand but was expensive. The oriental vase of thin tires, the pure porcelain jade, seems to flow slowly in the sun. And the walnut flower made of gold foil...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the descendant of the walnut." Until death. The mother was still stunned and cautiously presented the gift of the baron that year, a yellow and white strip. The shawl embroidered with purple walnut flowers on the lace is placed in the hands of the daughter. Perhaps, even she does not know who is the father of Paris, but in fantasy, the identity of the lady of the noble family is better than some The hoe of the poor people is better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After that, you joined the Cardinals?" Barrie pityfully touched Paris's hair, she still remembers. When the girl ran with the caravan of the tour troupe, she asked for a job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance and figure, as well as the crappy western accent, is not suitable for being an actor. The head of the team only discovered the conscience and barely accepted her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the Cardinals mixed quite well. It was a medium-sized squad, and even the actor had a handyman, and there were more than 20 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris worked very hard. Also good at pleasing others, the actors change clothes, even in the harsh winter, she still uses the hands of frostbite, carefully cleaned with cold water, like a servant, and is unbiased to serve every actor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, this inconspicuous ugly head, in the eyes of everyone, left a very good impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They teach girls makeup, teach her to use chalk and rouge to make up for the lack of appearance, teach her to choose the color of the clothes, teach her how to train the voice and how to smile on the stage And with the use of eyes, not long after, the girl rose from the handyman to the little actor who played the supporting role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For half a year, the 13-year-old Parisis stood firm in the Cardinals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the company also admitted that sometimes, hard work, can overcome the talent of mediocrity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But why, Baron Dalmark, are you looking for an illegitimate daughter?" Lauren asked, and this is also a strange doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know?" Paris shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you know who the other person is, it will be easy." Fran is calm and calm, "You go to the town to rent a room, stay temporarily, I went to Dalmark's pick and asked why.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't the alarm? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't make sense, the other party is very calm to find the lost daughter, although they don't even know what their daughter looks like, just rely on the shawl to prove identity." . Fran said, "What must have happened, otherwise it will not be so urgent. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dalmark, the land named after the lord's surname, is very prosperous.< Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rolling hills and sandstone make the land in the west poor, not suitable for reclamation, but there is the most precious treasure: gold mine.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work piaotian novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! From the first vein was discovered, " gold! gold! "People who used to take the whip and rushed to the west have gathered here. The peasants plucked the fields, the pioneers abandoned the reclamation, the workers dropped the tools, the civil servants left the desk, and even the missionaries abandoned their evangelism. In a few years, the barren land has prospered like a metropolis with hundreds of years of history, and all the aristocratic families that have been enshrined in the west are rich and rich.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is said that every Emperor of Byron wants to take back the ownership of the western seal, but the power of the aristocratic elders is always a constraint of the imperial power. Even if there is no family of gold mines in the territory, they are not willing to see the rights and traditions of the nobility. It was destroyed by the royal decree.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise it would be a bad start, today is the west, who knows, will it be the turn of tomorrow? Br />/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the final compromise, the western part of the annual mining amount of 70%, as a tax, paid to the national treasury.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The emperors never believed that the 70% would be the real amount of exploitation. Perhaps, in fact, even 50%, but no one can confirm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incorruptible tax officials and statisticians, the aristocrats in the west, have ways to drag them into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twinkling stars in the sky are like gems adorned with black curtains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the gentle slopes of the hills, the castles of the prestige are surrounded by thick walls and towering towers. There are no good stones in the west. The marbles of these buildings are all from Shipped in a distant place, the light freight rate exceeds its own value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manor, the racecourse, the mill, and the star are dotted around the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight in armor keeps patrolling, and even can say that this private residence is quite a bit of a military fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the west, the house of the Viscounts is already comparable to the mainland, some countdowned counts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold brings wealth and battle to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount of Heber Darmmark saw his cousin in the study. He was in his early forties and was full of beards. "In the rumor, I don't remember, My daughter is so beautiful." He looked at Matida, some doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl paled her face and shrunk in a goose blanket, and she didn’t say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount played the shawl. "What else can I confirm her identity besides this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "No, sir." One of the knights who took the Ma Tida said, "The thing happened more than ten years ago. If it wasn’t for passing through Dawn Fort, I found a girl wearing this shawl. We couldn’t have been in person. In the sea, find the illegitimate daughter in the rumors of the old lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viscount of Hebrew attempted to communicate with his cousin, but the answer was his girl’s teeth and nails. Mattida is like a frightened little beast, not letting anyone close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, your cousin, it seems that there is a problem with the brain." The Cavaliers said, "There is no difference between a child and a few years old."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, this really makes me sad." Heber didn't care. "It's time to take a break and take her to the bedroom. If you continue to cry, give her some sleeping pills."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting for Ma Dida to leave a few blood marks on the knight's face, screaming and being pulled out of the study, "Cousin a few years ago, after dying on a woman's belly, no one left, no one, only An illegitimate woman is still an idiot." He said to the butler who stood at the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not very good? We are easier to control." The butler replied respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But she is a sly illegitimate daughter? By a shawl, I can't prove anything, maybe I caught the wrong person."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s okay to be wrong, the key is to let the imperial ambassador of the emperor recognize: Baron Old Dalmark has heirs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The Supreme His Royal Highness, trying to recover the mining rights of the veins, every Western aristocrat, if there is no direct heir, his pick will be taken back by the state." Viscount Heber poured himself a glass of wine, "only Son or daughter, even my nephew can't inherit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of the best veins in the west is in the territory of the old baron. Unfortunately, he only now Half a life is left, meaning that you are not allowed to breathe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold belongs to the Darmack family, no one can take it away. Praise the Code, even the emperor, It is impossible to disclose the laws that violate the law. Those, will make all the nobles feel fear and unite." The Viscount said, Before the death of Zhai, we had to pass through the aristocratic court, forcing Tantin to recognize the inheritance of the idiot cousin. Of course, as her brother, at that time, she would be sent to help her to govern the territory."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have this grasp?" The steward advised, "After all, you are just a Viscount, a noble court, will you stand on our side?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hebrew has a good chest, "Of course not by the power of the Darmack family, but some people will help us." He picked up the letter on the desk, the envelope, the seal of the wax seal, one A magnificent gorse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The messenger of the Reinschmann family is already on the road." The viscount ordered, "The rooms are arranged and ready to meet our friends. When she arrives, immediately Representation to the aristocratic court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
