			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. The trojan stopped shaking when it was dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For three days, she couldn’t dream, every time she closed her eyes, the shadow jumped out of consciousness, stepping on the blood of the earth, looking at it. She smiled weirdly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile is sunny, but Lauvita only feels cold and bitter, like a chill in the winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the encounter of the limestone mountain range, the mysterious woman whose power is terrible to unimaginable makes her fear of peace, which seems to be imprinted in the depths of consciousness, and It did not fade away with time, but it became more and more intense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night is dark, she always smiles and says, "What shit king, I thought I could do whatever I want with my super power? I will be good next time I meet her." Design a trap to let her know the difference between man and beast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dawn, she clasped her knees and curled up on the bed. The body does not listen to the trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very anxious about a man’s arm, eager to hear a man admire, “I’m really good at it, I can’t leave you alone.” Even eager to relive the pain of being overwhelmed by a man and being held by the big hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, come back soon." Lauvita sobbed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the day comes, she appears in front of others, and the girl can always be calm and self-sufficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially when a woman who sees a big breasted visit every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barui is more and more annoying to the girl with gray eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woman's intuition is often particularly sensitive in one respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why every morning, she came to Fran’s house and stood in a demonstration-like manner against Ravitta across the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labetta took off his glasses and lifted his head out of a pile of documents. "The boss hasn't returned yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, estimate the time and distance, probably to Tantin today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there is a silent silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Baru looked at the tea in the cup and slowly became cold with the steaming heat. I couldn’t help but say, “You should rest in bed. "It is best to sleep well and leave immediately. Lauvita knows what the other person’s words are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The boss didn't put his mind in the company. The accounting and staffing arrangements were very messy. When he was not there, he was responsible for sorting out the details. It was my own. Mission. "Laugha signed a letter at the end of a contract and closed the folder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights are leaving me, can you understand the commercial operation of his company? Barry knows this, what is the meaning of the deputy manager of the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She screamed and put the cup that had just been put back on the table. Well, if the head of the group moved a little bigger, the splash of water would be more. We can replace the word "put" with: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"fall". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this Sao woman really older than me?" Lavetta coconut thought, "naive."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't know what she wants to pursue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She does not know the true identity of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lauvita does not understand much, what is the head, but she has already guessed that it is a big plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What she should do now is silent assistance. Instead of expressing your feelings passionately, to create troubles that he does not need now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you like the boss?" Lauvita said suddenly. "So I am hostile to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This sentence made Barrie unable to prevent it. She thought that the gray-eyed girl officially declared war, so she did not hesitate to answer. "I met with Quasimodo three years ago. I get along very well, and..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautita interrupted her, "That Just show your love boldly. If you don't say it, who else will know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the team surprised the opponent will say so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, as an employee, should not interfere too much with the boss's private life, but your performance over the past few days has been very troublesome for me." You don't..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think I like Mr. Bo Knight?" Lauvita said with a smile. "He is a good boss. I have a lot of rapport with him." But the feelings are limited to work, so I am entangled in innocent embarrassment, not what I want." Barrie is dubious. But the kind expression on the face of Lauvita is not like a lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, the boss is a piece of wood, don't look at his thoughtfulness, but he is emotionally slow, I don't believe it, you haven't made any hints." Ask and ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is..." Barrie remembered a lot, those who deliberately made it for him, wearing pajamas in front of his door. In exchange for the indifferent reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, the head of the group followed the words of Lauvita and step by step. At noon, Barry has fully believed that Lauvita is not a bad woman in her imagination. She said everything, she wants to reveal her depression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Casimo is still missing his wife, but he can't let go." She sighed in a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead wife? I have never heard of it. Lauvita is secretive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then use your enthusiasm to melt him." She said the numb line in a joking tone, and asked with concern, "You know his wife's How many things? Maybe we can analyze the boss's preference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting out what you want to know from the mouth of an ordinary woman is easy for Lauvita. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Barry returned to the Heihe Hotel, she smiled and her steps were light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go out early in the morning, what good things are you doing?" Nicole, who is repeatedly practicing the details of the stage, asked inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to say that Miss Whitemane, the assistant of Casimofei, is a good man. God, I actually had a disgusted feeling for her." Barry said loudly, "I think we can be good friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work 16k novel network exclusive text version of the first release, without permission can not be reproduced, excerpts, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one o'clock in the morning, Fran returned to Tantin. He asked Moore to return to the building to provide the dormitory, and then quickly returned to the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he opened the door, he saw Lauvita under the lamp, draped his feet, and archived a stack of documents. Her face was pale, her body was thin, her arms and ankles were tied with light bandages with a sterilizing syrup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The home is brightly lit, and even the wall lamps in the kitchen and corner corridor are open and dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she heard the sound of the key turning the door lock, she turned back and stood in front of the half-open cabinet, her eyes flashing in anticipation The light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly, jumping into the light of joy, turning into a calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita slowly moved to Fran and said in a tone of exchange of business affairs, "You must know something about the movie king." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shadow King? Is it in the limestone mountains, have you met them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost all The army was annihilated, and there was only one person in the other party. And I am still not sure if Longchi is really dead.” Lauvita will sneak into the cupboard and pull out a brown paper bag. “I’ve been analyzing the movie king these days. Intelligence, but the clues are too few, there are some speculations, you should..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan looked at the withered face, the cheeks and the cheeks Deep dark circles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will talk later." He slammed the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation is urgent, their strength is not that we can fight now, we must race against time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You should take a good sleep now." Fran frowned. "Since the opponent is very strong, it is necessary to maintain a good energy to cope with all kinds of unexpected situations."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." The girl nodded in obedience and walked upstairs to the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stair steps make it difficult for a girl with a physical injury to get up. The muscles hurt the bruises on the body, and the bone fractures were sore, and Lauvita had a slight cold sweat on his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she was picked up by the waist, and the heart of Lauvita began to squat, she looked up with joy, but only saw an indifferent s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the bedroom door, Fran put her down. "Tomorrow, tell me everything you know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl feels a disappointment in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't expect anything to happen, but head, it would be better to be more enthusiastic about her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I am going to mix two drugs, it is good for bone injuries and bruises." When Lauvita just walked into the door, Fran said, he I paused. "You're fine, I'm very happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's a reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Reward?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When no one, change back to your other appearance, to be honest, the head of this strong man, I am true Not used to it.” The girl raised her hands and turned Fran’s collar, which was lifted by the road, and smiled, closing the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bedroom was dark and did not turn on the light. She leaned behind the door and the corners of the mouth solidified with a faint vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women always change their moods because of a man’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laugha stood in the darkness and suddenly felt nothing terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran put the girl’s finished documents on the desk, walked to the cabinet where the tobacco was placed, opened the small glass door, and took out one of the irons. The box, the brownish tobacco is sprinkled on the tissue paper, slowly rolled up, ignited, and soon, the rich smoke floats in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
