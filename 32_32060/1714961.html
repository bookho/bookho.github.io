			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a meaningless battle." Longmai said with annoyance that she didn’t know why she was inexplicably involved in something that was irrelevant to her. For the assassin walking in the dark, this is against the taboo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invasive skin, painful, weak, slow, paralyzed, at least four negative energy, making her physical condition very bad. Worse, her headaches started to start again, and many strange scenes lingered in my thoughts, and my consciousness gradually blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the holy warrior, although the power is not mastered, he can’t control the black gas exploding in the other’s brain, but no one can spur After wearing the brain, still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her lips are not bloody. "Tonight is a bad day. If my brother knows, he has to lick it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Return to the headquarters immediately? No, you can't let those jigsaws look at jokes." Although the ability is only awakened for two years, in the Longmai, the qualification is always more important than the effort, she called For the king's level of talent, almost overnight, let her stand at the top of the underground world, the food chain of the weak meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-yard space around the body belongs to her completely, magic, Austrian law, dragon veins, physical laws, any power, as long as it is close to this range, it will be chaotic, by She is at the mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even her brother, the assassin master known as the Darkwalker, said, "What you lack is just a combat experience, otherwise, a hundred assassins, too Not your opponent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only weakness is that this ability does not protect the inside of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon scorpion slammed the discomfort, she stared at the ground, the man who brought her familiarity, but was very strange, "Hell, no impression." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She squinted her head, thinking strangely, and then turned into a virtual shadow, and soon disappeared into the forest side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce and short-lived battle was calm, and the moon hangs high in the air, shining from the leaves of the sleazy, and giving the whole world a silvery color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran lies in the earth, the holy force of the Eternal Cabinet, constantly repairing the broken body, the semi-melted muscles, the red granules appearing like Newborn seedlings breed under the call of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart is cold, cold, blood is cold, like a fallen, stone statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The halo of the stars, like the mist of the fountain splashing, lingers in the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An awakened hare, attracted by the light and fog, curiously jumped on Fran’s body, chasing the floating light in the air, no For a while, it stood still, long ears kept shaking, and seemed to hear an inexplicable sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咚...咚......咚......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slow and powerful beat, re-enter Recover in the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand moved slightly, the frightened rabbit, immediately ran back to the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran lay on the ground and looked at the arc of the sky. "I...it is no longer human." He smiled, and for a long time, slowly climbed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body has recovered, or as ugly as ever, the bleak scars still exist, but the ring that provides the transformation is gone, on the finger, wear In the place where the ring is, there is a strange uplift, **, like a block old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched the uplift, did not know if he could have a transformation, and remembered the samurai who pursued him, and immediately looked around in horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is not far away, half leaning against the tree, her head hanging on her chest, not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franland hurriedly walked over, muscles were tight, and when there was an emergency, he immediately fled. I have already seen it, the power of this girl is far Beyond his imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the approach, the girl still did not respond, Fran reached out and gently lifted her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matilda's forehead to the back of the brain, with a small wound, seems to be a weapon, running through the head, completely lost consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly breathing, but not far from death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor person, but for me, it is a blessing." Fran sighed, he touched the tiny but deadly wound, prepared go away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singular incitement emerges in the body, and the energy of the sacred object seems to be summoned, echoing the residual power of the samurai, from the finger , condensed into a little light group, drifting into the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is like a lightning strike, the body is pumping strongly, weakly breathing into a rough sigh, slowly, quiet, tightly closed Double eyes, pale face, more ruddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...there is such a power." Fran was shocked, and another cruel thought was screaming, and the cry was getting louder and louder, "killed." She, kill her, or wait for her to wake up, it is you who died..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, no matter how good, she can’t even escape Escape, hey, how thin the neck, hold your hand, with just a little effort, no one will stop his revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kill her! Kill her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran's hand, slowly put on the girl's slender neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not a wicked person, but is blinded by faith! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand is shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crazy as a belief! The name of false justice kills others! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten fingers, gradually close, as long as one force...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurry, she is yours enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are my enemy." Fran's face was distorted, he hesitated and indignant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
