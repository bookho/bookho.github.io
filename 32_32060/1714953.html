			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger of the girl gradually fades as the sun goes down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl has the feeling of being teased in the palm of her hand, but the idea of ​​finding the dirty monster made her have to listen to Mr. Toposo’s arrangement for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not enough for the world, or the experience." The girl thought, then sat down on the chair in the window and prayed quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan drank a slightly sweet wine, such as a bloody red liquid, gently swaying in a glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years ago, the vineyards in the south of Byron had a bumper harvest, and the year-round sunshine and temperature that made the wines comparable to gold The best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine on the table is one of the collections of the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the great taste didn’t alleviate Fran’s troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the holy warrior and figured that he must marry her before the end of the transformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women and mad believers are hard creatures, and the lady in front of them is a combination of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A monster, about two meters tall, ugly, has traces of stitching throughout the body. I must send this monster to the firearm." The words made him surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Ma Tida was searching for her savior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anno's holy warrior has its own set of distinctions between good and evil in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, as with the church’s asylum law, as long as it is not the Father of 亵du, the fallacy, the doctrine, and any evil deeds, can be forgiven. With forgiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder the lady, the smuggled market town, just disgusted instead of shouting the holy words to purify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rigid and unconceived mode of thinking made Fran poor and ridiculous, looked at his eyes with pity, clenched his hands, and prayed for two hours. Girl, "But in some ways, I am like her, really." He thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inadvertently, I found a potential enemy again." Fran smiled. "I have to hide from her in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 6 pm, the hotel The buddy sent dinner, a plate of lamb, two stewed tuna with pepper, cream lettuce salad and seaweed soup, barely rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some desserts that are obviously prepared for girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said that the auction started at 7:30." The buddy placed the tableware on the table and filled the small silver bowl with the hand to fill the hot water. Put in a clean towel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the dude went out, Fran shouted, "Miss Hepburn, please dine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long time Ma Tida stopped the prayer, took a section of the bag from the carry-on bag, and tore it off in small pieces and sent it to the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you angry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Mr. Toposo." The girl is cold Answer, "We are just strangers, can't take your love again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran smiled, no more invitations, he ate very slowly, It was not until 7:30 that the dishes moved a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smuggling leader came as the appointment, he knocked on the door. "Hello, if you want to go to the auction house, now is the time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lead the way." Fran sorted out his clothes and looked at himself in front of the mirror in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complete aristocrat, the face of the oily face is solidified with arrogance, the expression that he hated most before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Life is in a falsehood, playing various roles, this is me now." Fran touched his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the almost untouched meals on the table, and seeing the beautiful sacred and beautiful samurai, wrapped in leftover bread, smuggled The leader thought angrily. "What rights do the nobles have? It can make her so desperate, and even eat a meal." He is more convinced of Fran's identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buildings in the market town are very low, the gray walls and gray doors and windows, through the fork of the town center, the leader knocked open a house that is no different from the surrounding buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smuggling dens, the more secret things, the more hidden in the most inconspicuous places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first floor of the house is an ordinary dwelling, while the second floor is a very wide hall. Ten people who have a business look are holding a sign and bidding. Just use the brand to pick it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no screaming voice, no auctioneer screams with excitement, the auction site is quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some goods without buyers in the auction house, three barrels of tobacco, selling one hundred and fifty gold coins, and one bundle of good wool, only six Ten Caesars are one-third cheaper than the market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally there are some antiques, all dirty, and they are sold soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need some special services." Fran whispers to the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which kind? Is the message or commissioned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there any..." Fran looked at Hepburn and the girl sat in a position away from the two chairs. "Is there a strange person who has ever seen this belt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weird People?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, not the ordinary person, with some supernatural factors. What information is OK, I am paying a big price."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you a singer? We are just ordinary smugglers, but we don't have the daring to listen to the intelligence of such people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is relieved, here is very close to the fee, he will be known for months when he is staying at Master Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the mysterious reputation of the Master well preserved this secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, when will your head come to Sarah? I want to meet him personally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no reason, only the head informs me, not my notice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you see him, say that I have a big deal to talk to him." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, how can I contact you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want me to wait?" He? No, I will send someone, you only need to inform him about it." Fran handed the leader a piece of cardboard, painted in beautiful colors, and was hot in the middle of "Van Toposo" name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the purpose of Fran here, and I am slowly coming into contact with Igo Andech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, my baby is also a little private to ask you, answer truthfully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Ma Tida asked, the leader said faithfully, "No, dear lady, a monster? You should go to the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girl is disappointed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last day of the auction, there was really nothing good. The final auction was an antique book, which was made up of several large pieces of parchment, which read Strange words and some patterns, no one wants to buy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Fran took the book from the auctioneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, maybe some scholars are willing to buy, but they won't come here." The leader shrugged. "The auctions have not been sold for several years." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The text Fran does not understand, but those patterns, he can recognize a small and half, are hand-painted plants, under the guidance of William, he I have learned a lot about the wonderful herbs that can be found in the book, many unheard of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plain green leaves and small yellow flowers, but the roots of the ground are like the female body; the other, with long fleshy branches, dotted Countless thin spikes, the painting is using a leaf to fight a fierce beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture is very sloppy, looks down, like a childish fantasy reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I will buy it." Fran flipped the book. "But you have to talk about its origins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will ask." The leader said He called his subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the trophy of the Raman people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prosperity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, sir." The subordinate replied, "Rahman is the head of the slave and often goes hunting in the Black Continent. This book was obtained in a hunting slave." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you see Raman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm afraid I can't, he didn't come back last year. The leader laughed. "The slaves will occasionally become the prey of the indigenous people. Poor Raman and his men may have become the orc's plate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much does it cost?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can just open a price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Fran put the book, "It is an unexpected harvest." He meditated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea washes the sound of the reef gently, like a melodious serenade, moonlight Yantian exudes a little shimmer of stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Hepburn, it should be separated." Zhenkou, Fran said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Toposo, may the Father bless you, the happiness and love of the Lord are always with you." Matilda's fingers crossed the cross in the void, " You are helping me with sincerity, or seeing me as a tool for your purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran looking at the girl, the moonlight of the style, As for the evening makeup, on her holy expression, smeared a trace of flattering, "may, both."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two horses are moving differently Going in the direction, at first, I heard the hooves of the other party. Soon, both of them were covered by the secluded night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
