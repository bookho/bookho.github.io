Within three seconds, the flint could not function."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullan pressed the firearm in a puzzled manner, and the iron sanding rim cocked vigorously, but the fire did not spurt the flame. But after a few seconds, the finger has left the wheel, and the gas outlet has a brilliant flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As a member of the Shadow King, I think, I am also a dragon." Lauvita is nervous, she is afraid that her head will show a disgusted expression. Think of her as a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Fran’s plain tone made her feel relieved. “Maybe you will feel embarrassed about it, but sometimes it’s not a bad thing to be different.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his mouth and decided to conceal his healing power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I am qualified to accompany you to fight together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You help I am too much, sometimes I am thinking, how to repay you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use your whole person to repay. Of course, Lauvita did not say anything. She smiled like a flower. "The head is very gentle and often thinks for others, but it is too gentle, but not good. The struggle in the future will be very difficult, and people who are not self-protecting can not be involved." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Barry, although the head is like a not The wood of the style, but the heart is clearer than anyone else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran's eyes looked into the distance, "Yeah, I know better than anyone else. Barrie is a Very good girl, I really can't bring her danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe I am talking, head, do you really like her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was silent for a long time, "In fact, I am very selfish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"selfish?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Red Bird Theatre is a warm place, like a home, Nicole is hot and passionate, Lauren is always happy, Xiaosai Celia is lovable, and Barry. Know how to care for people, self-improvement and kindness. I am eager to see their warmth, as if to find a sanctuary for the soul. Breaking with them, forming a stranger, can make the whole theater safe. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't let them continue to do so, or they will be subtle, and the head will be smashed by the damn big breasts." Lauvita said, "Now I thought about dealing with the enemy with all my heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the event, he might try to choose a relationship."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any female creature that attempts to appear on the head must be killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can only belong to me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to completely possess him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In my body, there is nothing that has not been conquered by you. You have taken its life and carried its death..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breeze blows into the rehearsal room on the fifth floor of Heihe Hotel, the cotton curtain pats the window, and Barry Silana puts out a few strands of hair scattered around the corner, hands Supporting the chin, leaning against the round table in front of the window, absent-mindedly listening to the final rehearsal of the troupe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last time I was encouraged by Lauvita. The head of Baru has been thinking about emotional things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the scheduled schedule. After the wedding performance, the troupe will tour the holy city of Anno, but just think of it. She was to be separated from Fran, and her heart felt uneasy and stinging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I hope you will take me, just ask you to leave me a pair of eyes so that I can see you." Nicole is in front of the curtain Continue to recite the lines of the love drama, and exchanged tacit eyes with Lauren from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barry smiled and watched the silent communication between the two people, picked a spoonful of sugar, sprinkled it into the espresso, took a sip, mixed with a bitter bitter sweetness, lingering in her taste buds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If coffee is the relationship between me and Casimodo, the initiative is eager, it is honey, now coffee, Sugar is not enough." Barry's blush was a bit fierce, and an unconscious thought was uninvited. "Dearly, Lauvita is right, suggesting that it doesn't work for that wood, I have to be more calm."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up violently, and the action was a bit bigger. Nicole stopped to recite, "Is there anything wrong with the lines?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, very good, you continue, I will go out to do something." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still want to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The troupe is not leaving, I can't, what? You and Lauren deal with it." She finished, hurried into her room, flattening the wrinkled part of the skirt in front of the mirror, finishing the appearance, and courageously nodded to the mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I came to Fulan’s house, after pressing the doorbell, Barry suddenly felt that the whole person was in a mess, like a sailboat in the sea of ​​life. The smog lost its way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened, the ash girl poked her head out. "I thought that you will be busy dealing with the troupe today." She opened half of her body and gestured. The head of the team is advanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is Quasimodo?" Barrie’s voice was somewhat disappointing. "I didn't see him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The boss has some business to deal with." "When can I get back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is estimated that around 10 o'clock in the evening." The head looked down at his hands, again I touched the back of my hand again and again, "Hey, I... I..." She wants to discuss with Lauvita, there is no secret between the women who have no competition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita walked towards her, her face was warm and smiling, she whispered, "What do you want to say?" , is it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Casimodo has a thriving career in Tantin, can not be willing to ask him to leave his job, accompany me to go to Anno "Barry said, "The dream of performing at the Tandin Grand Theatre has been realized, and the monastic worship theater in the Holy City is also the honor of a dancer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Lauvita is a good listener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you go down, there will be no results."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can chase happiness, woman It’s time to take the initiative.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m going to give the troupe to Nicole after I’m going back from the Holy City tour, it’s going to take about half a year. Simodo, but should confess after returning, or before leaving Tantin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautita clenched his fists and nailed his nails Into the palm of her hand, she said calmly, "The person who drags the water will never succeed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The boss has often spit up the water recently, saying that although the career is successful, but very lonely, there is an appreciation of your words." She hinted, "I will go out at night, can determine the relationship, you go The Holy City is also at ease." Originally, Barry also thought about it six months later, and then clarified the life of the troupe, but the words of Lauvita gave her confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of determination is embarrassing, but once she made up her mind, she felt relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bookshelf is covered with gray. Manuscripts, bookbindings, sheepskin rolls, countless books piled up on the shelves, Fran climbed down the ladder with the roller and stared at the name on the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the relationship between natural lightning and current mechanics - Jassavin", Fulan spent all day searching for information in the library of the University of Tanding But the results made him puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anno's holy warrior, why should you pretend to be a professor in the field of science. Hunting for the infidels? Nothing, it is not the medieval Middle Ages." A little movement, "current mechanics?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard the term, it is in the sewer of Feidu, when I just woke up..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he got home, about nine o'clock in the evening, Lauvita seemed to have left, and the hall was quiet. Fran turned on the light and took off his shirt to reveal a scarred body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chandelier suddenly went out. A warm body. Embrace him from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment of heartbeat, Fran gently pulled the hand around his waist, "Barry?" he asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃." Some people behind me are in a hurry. Fran returned and looked at the head of the group with a look of resentment, and the sexy lips opened slightly. She did not wear underwear, only wearing a thin silk sleeping set, under the faint light of the moonlight infiltrating the window, the charming body was looming under the satin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clearing of the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-naked beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there something more tempting than this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to inform you that tomorrow is the most grand performance "Butry said awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I will join in." Fran smiled. "But it’s not a pleasure to have a hug."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the performance, the troupe will go to Anno. I have received invitations from several bishops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leading the troupe, in the name The theater performance is your dream, congratulations." Fran looked upstairs, "Lowvita? She left you tonight tonight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" She won't be back tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Fran didn't know what to keep talking about, he waved his hands, broad shoulders and muscles, that An ugly scar is in the eyes of the people trapped in love. Exudes wildness, but the eyes are serene and deep, and there is a kind of temperament that fits perfectly with the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you have some misunderstandings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Misunderstanding? You understand what I want, And I am willing to admit, yes, whenever I think about building a family at night, I can think of you when I wake up to feel the body temperature of the pillow." Barry said desperately, for fear that once she stopped, Lost courage, "Casimodo, tell me, you think the same, even if there is only a little bit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She licked her chest, her fingers, and the nipples that were erected by the excitement, clung to the smooth satin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making a good idea, I will not treat you badly. Barry is elated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be a real tour troupe, and one day I can perform at the opera house in the big city. Barry smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave in the troupe, run the Cardinals with me, if you want to do this, just like swearing before God, please promise, don't suddenly disappear. Barrie hopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a beautiful woman worthy of love, how can people not be tempted? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I never thought about it, just treating you as a good companion in business operations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fran heard this saying, "I don't want to delay the performance of the troupe tomorrow, please come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢...I understand. "Barui stared at him and smiled awkwardly. "That, let's try another one." She squatted and hooked Fran's neck with her hand. The whole person fell into his arms and bit his. Mouth, her lips are hot and his mouth is cold and thorough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took him to the ground, led it, slowly moved down, touching the wet and warm place, "Look, I am soaked. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not like you, don't be crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you Just when you meet a woman who is lonely, you should be pity for her, comforting her, only one night. Please don't be so cold-blooded, the day after tomorrow I will leave Tantin with a group, you don't have to bear any responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran took the princess's softness and put a large coat on her. "I invested in the troupe's money, just..." he thought I think it should be done more absolutely. "Come to me after tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lauvita stood in the dim light of the streetlight, and looked at the watch on his wrist with a restless heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pointer moved to 10:20, she saw the iron gate slammed open, and the head of the barui rushed out with tears, looked around and slammed the robe, probably standing After five minutes, I waved a rental carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black River Hotel." She heard the sound of Barry with a weak cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Lauvita took only half of the cigarettes in his hand and sucked it all at once. "Childish woman, I am really afraid that you are involved, but don't think that I will let you go so far, please believe that hateful women pick up and are more vicious than the scorpion."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walked toward the house and took a few steps. Stopped again, "Tonight, let the first person stay, I am not suitable for appearance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This works 16k novel network exclusive text version starting, not It is not allowed to reprint, extract, and more recent and fastest chapters, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up, the night sky is smeared with sparse stars, and the moon is half covered by a black-gray cloud, which looks very cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folan Ping took a sip of tea and sat on the edge of the wicker chair. The horse and the carriage flowed through the main road outside the house. The distant buildings were like Qionglou Yuyu. Glittering lights. There seem to be hundreds of billions of thin spots in the air. Let the city be wrapped in glory. From time to time, salutes screamed, highlighting another great man worthy of being welcomed by the Royal Ceremony Team to reach the city of Tantin because it was too far away. When passed to the ear, it has become a fine micro-sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is boiling, so that the night is melted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of thoughts are intertwined in Fran's mind, and there is a terrible, inexplicable temper. He drank a few cups of herbal tea, but he still felt hot and uneasy, dark, negative, burning strong emotions, and he was fidgeting from the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside. The voice of the people, the voice of the car, cheering and screaming wildly, intertwined into countless screaming noises, surrounded him with darkness, and gradually became dead, silent, dull, speechless... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a good day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you going to sell the gold cufflinks?” An Mei asked. “Now there is still some money left in the house. The dresses and gold foil pocket watches are gone. You have to be a little decent. Go out to socialize.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are more important things to buy, lunch is full of fun, I will give you a surprise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little wild cat seems to understand What, the slight shame of dyed red cheeks made her beautiful, "I came back early, in fact, that is the tradition, not too expensive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast XI Point, he came home, the house was spotless, people feel warm and beautiful, the table is covered with white napkins, cheese, minced meat and fried cakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grandma is still resting upstairs, waiting for me to send the meal up, do you have anything to say?" The girl is wearing only the satin dress, hands Tightly overlapping on the chest, looking forward to the happy corner of the corner of the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." He pulled out a small red-wrapped box from his jacket pocket and a shiny ring on the lined hard sponge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't say that I have to promise." Anzheng tried to stay restrained and did not care, a heart actually jumped wildly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you promise?" Fran said strangely. "It’s difficult for the judicial community in Feidu to hire a prosecutor suspected of having a bad record. I have to find something. Luzi, wait for a court chief to come to dinner, I am going to give it to his wife to show it. "An Mei has a disappointing disappointment and frustration on his face, "Oh."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can find a job, are you not happy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." The girl barely smiled. "I am going to add two." Set of cutlery, when are they coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It won't be long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour Fran said, "Let's eat first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the court and the couple have not come yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on and re-do some small dishes." An Mei food like chewing wax, she looked at the ring on her finger, Fran did not let her wear, said that the length of the lady's finger is similar to her, first Try to find out if the ring size is right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now it's all the lunch hour." After eating, An Mei whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I go to the alley, etc., you pack the table."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Fran turned back. "The president and the couple sent me to inform me that I have another entertainment. I want to invite me to participate. The carriage is outside the house." "You go." "Hey, go together." The wheel is pressed on the bluestone road. The car was slightly trembled. It didn't take long for An Mei to scream. "Hey, stop, I put the gift on my hand, I didn't take the box, how can I give it away?" She took off the ring in a panic. Pinched in his hand, fear has affected Fran's future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you have already sent it out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咦?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she saw Fran from the bottom of her seat, took out a bunch of delicate flowers, and the back of the ring in her hand, engraved with the abbreviation of her own name, I understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That...what are we going to now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Affiliated Church of the Civil Administration, Inspector Lyme is waiting, he is a witness. Grandma and Black Jack are also in the carriage behind." "Bad things." She whispered, snuggling over, cheeks licking his collarbone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marry me okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy stunnedly in front of the mirror, the pink cockroach floated on top of her head. Gorgeous jewellery is well-worn, delicate and beautiful on the fingers, wearing a ring made of the most precious materials, inlaid with six round jade earrings, elegantly lying on the earlobe. There is a graceful hair between the curves, the crown of the splendid flowers and the middle of the crown, inlaid with a blue and flawless blue diamond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful dress is lightly draped in the delicate skin like ivory, white and clean wedding dress, which makes her more expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius von Como is obviously suppressing the joy in his heart, his lips are shaking, his eyes are confused, he tries to calm his breath, and he is afraid of turbidity. Nasal snoring, reading the beauty of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Peggy..." he murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please don't add the word Miss. Tomorrow I am your wife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Um. Peggy... Peggy...” Julius snorted, as if to name the name forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lady smiled lightly. The corner of his mouth rose, and the smile that floated with a slight smile gave him great courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoldering fire in his body suddenly broke out, the accumulated love was ruined, and the blood rushed to the head. He walked a little bit and slowly took her. The face, the fingertips slipped off the eyebrows, gently stroking, thinking that it always contains arrogance and self-esteem. Reassuring and tender as water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy’s body was stiff, and her hand clung to the elegant skirt. Gradually, she relaxed, her eyelashes flashed and she squinted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius has dreamed of countless times, his wife's delicate lips, what a taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sweet like a mountain spring? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it hot like a flame? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fragrance like a shoe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like a glacial cold, without temperature and feelings.
