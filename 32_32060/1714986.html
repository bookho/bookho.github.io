			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. At four o'clock in the afternoon, Fran went into the second-class criminal court on the 13th. The crimson carpet in front of the door was slightly old, and the furnishings in the room were also antiques. The goods, this court has six small courtrooms, including two night courts, so the lights in the whole room will not be extinguished until about one o'clock in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den’s cases are carried out here every day. They are all small cases that are commonplace, stealing, fighting, burglary, extortion, and the identity of the defendant is usually Feidu. The gang, Fran, on the bench in front of the small courtroom, saw the policeman, the policeman who was escorting the prisoner, the scorpion, the fierce look, waiting for the judge to summon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, be honest." Fran heard the patrolman telling the accused, and the prisoner scratched the mud on the edge of the chair and said carelessly. "Four months of imprisonment, because I am sure I can't afford to pay a fine. How can I get used to it? I will be familiar with it. I will go straight to prison. I can come out one day earlier." "This is the procedure." The patrolman replied. It is impossible for the law to shut a thief who steals only a small amount of money each time for ten years. The thieves of Feidu are familiar with the law. Every time they succeed, they never commit crimes again. They don’t start to look for the next goal until they leave their wallets to their associates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theft and the attachment are not known, the handover process is also quickly concealed, stealing 100 and stealing 500, the result of the penalty is completely different, but the patrol is forever You can only find one, wallet from the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss, may I ask the President in the court? Fran asked, the clerical and court secretary of the court is a middle-aged woman with glasses, neat clothes, and good nails, which are of the type that is critical and rigorous.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr., what are you doing? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the second officer of the wind horn", Fran is pulling, the ships coming and going from the port, not through patient inquiry. It is difficult to find out Which boat is called the wind horn, "The matter that the president has asked for is already done, send me to inform. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, the president is not in the office." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When can he come back?" "Oh, schedule, I can't divulge it at random, you can write a letter, sign it and hand it to me." Transfer for you. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I can't write..." Fran felt his head and pinched his hat on his chest. He said nervously and shyly. "You see, if the captain knows that I can't do anything about it, it will make you laugh." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, boy, you said I wrote, you are the wind..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wind horn, the day before the arrival at the dock. Come back from Andara."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the specific thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s one..." The second officer suddenly stopped. "I still inform him in person, after all..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary thought, maybe it was a private or an embargo. But she has no reason to manage the superiors, and in the circle of rich people, it is not wrong to enjoy something that cannot be bought in the market. She turned over the itinerary and today the president is not available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will come back in a few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." "It's not good to run. After all, the amount of unloading is large. We can't send more sailors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running? One? The secretary’s imagination came up with the answer. It’s not going to be a woman, no matter where. The poor people sometimes sell their daughters to let the family continue to live, and the exotic girls of Mamouk are a good choice for the mistress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the president of Dunawen is known for his lingering flowers. She has heard of it. The father of the president, Mr. Dunawen, who has left the position of the Chief of Staff, can I have complained a lot about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is attending the meeting, and I am not sure. When will the President come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fran knows this meeting. Every year, the summer seminar of the judicial department of Feidu is being held. He once participated once. The content is nothing more than the promotion of various positions, the allowance for the resignation staff, the vacant space to sit, and some For a new interpretation of these articles, refer to the comments of the case. The meeting usually lasts for one week and only the senior staff above the vice president are invited to participate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good opportunity to get in touch with each other. Sometimes the meeting drags on until the evening, the attendees usually go home directly instead of going back to the office, even if it is early Growing up prosecutors often invite each other to attend a private salon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really bad. Did he have time in the evening? The president must have contacted him and not to inform the family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night after tomorrow, Duna heard A meal, the secretary thought about it, decided to tell the second officer, "The day after tomorrow, Bao Ding Street No. 27, the president may go there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you "The second officer said, "I will return to the ship. If you can come back tomorrow, you can ask him to send a carriage to the port. If not, I will go to him the day after tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Peer?" The secretary asked strangely, then suddenly remembered that this was the name of the President of the Eleventh Tribunal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second deputy took out the paper with the address. "Isn’t this the eleventh court? I can’t read, the passersby guide me to the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This damn illiterate, delaying her time. The secretary thought angrily. The next day, Al Duna heard that he had just returned to the office to get the documents. When asked what was going on, the secretary replied that everything was working properly, and then told Ayr about yesterday’s joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, Pei? I have a chance to laugh at him. The guy is almost sixty, and he is ready to raise a mistress." Ayle said happily and asked again. Tao, "What is the arrangement for tomorrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At 8 pm, a bank office in Golden Road has made an appointment to invite you to the party." The secretary gave the itinerary The president looked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bao Dian Street 27", Ayr looked at the address, "I will attend when I arrive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fran felt that the time was a little anxious, and the people who had been hooked up by Ayre had not decided yet. At 8 o'clock tomorrow, I have to find it before that. But a lot of girls who are daring and want to make a fortune are not arrogant, but they have a good appearance but their heads are empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the morning of the day, Fran had not found a candidate. "Maybe give up this opportunity, wait a few more days." He discussed with Kregan. At this time, the golden goose's hospitality knocked on the door, "handsome guy, your little lover came to you." The receptionist grumbled and said, "No wonder these two days did not come to me, it turned out that I had it, but I Look at the little girl, the skill is definitely not good for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
