			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Nothing! Zolfa Longch sat in a chair in frustration, the coffee on his hand was already cold, and his future was defeated. According to the principle of criminology, in the first few days of fugitive exile, the probability of capture is the largest, and the longer the time, when the prisoner finds a way to dissolve into the society, after the sound is secret, he can catch it and can only pray for the lucky care. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that prisoners who want to enter the Golden Horn Bay must pass through Hyde City. But he went to the Hayde police station several times. The director always said coldly, "Helping you is my responsibility, but you can't let the bureau put all the energy and all the hands on it, and maintain the security of the city. It is also my vocation. I will inform you if there is news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zorph guess, the other party does not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the assistance of the local police station, it is not enough for him and the detectives he brought with the inspector of São Paulo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the inspector politely said goodbye, "Mr. Long Qi, I have to go back to St. Paul, and staying will not help."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They killed three policemen and one judge, just give up? The deceased is your colleague."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detective silence For a moment, with an expression of indignation, "Kregan will always go back to the west, where is his nest, I am waiting for the day to send him to the guillotine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; &nbsp; Zall Law knows that this is a fart, the inspector can not stay in a province that is difficult to detect, and stay away from the province. This will affect his position in the police station in São Paulo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, people who love rights like Zall Law should return to the dark police hall to return to life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret police did not only have one of his team leaders, he did not complete the task, he did not have to resist all the responsibilities alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this person feels a sense of frustration like never before, especially when the prisoner has appeared in front of him and slipped away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wolf is hunting, he will retreat with self-comfort in the unfavorable circumstances. But there are always a few coyotes, and they will be inexplicably mad. For the carrion in the mouth, he did not hesitate to attack the lion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, in the eyes of Zall Law, the enemy should only be excused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was kicked by the rabbit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no longer a problem in merit, but private hatred and extremes. Zall's law can't stand it, fleeing back to the nest, getting together and laughing. The wolf is stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For me to hand over a private letter to the dark police station. Well, you are gone, then I will stay alone." He told the inspector. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspector’s face is a little feverish, thinking, "How good is the secret policeman, it seems that the dark police hall is not all a group of people who like to fish through the world, at least this Mr. Longchi, with the spirit of knight, will not give up his reputation without regaining his reputation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kindly took the shoulder of Zall Law and thought about it. "The São Paulo General Directorate can't manage the things in the Golden Horn Bay. But I have an old friend who is a detective in the patrol hall of Feidu. Maybe you can find his help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"费都?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. The old guy is called Lyme, Lyme Cux, who used to deal with the case beforehand. If you see him, ask me for a good voice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fedor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kregan struggled to read the words on the paper, and he patted his head, puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Feidu, if you say that the city has the most wealthy people, then there is only a fee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What kind of plan did you conceive, maybe ambush on the side of the road. It is more convenient to rob a few passing carriages," said Kregan. "The capital of Feidu is almost the capital of the Gulf. You Crazy, the total number of patrols and spies there is more than the three General Directors of São Paulo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On dozens of Caesars at a time? Continuously doing The case will only alert the authorities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran describes the prospects, "Since you want to grab, come big one time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I have more than a dozen men now, I will dare to do it. I can always wait until the rich people settle down and go out of town, but relying on two or three people to go to the robbery is full of money for the bodyguards everywhere. It is unrealistic." Kregan was hesitant, and he was surprised that this kind-hearted person suddenly became crazy. "But a good change." He thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only monkeys will be happy for a few bananas..." Fran picked his brows uncomfortably. He found that the tone was like someone." ... Let's just say, if things go well, we can get enough tickets to get through the officials of the higher authorities. It is not difficult to cancel the identity of the overnight order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Failure "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then continue to flee, no difference now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan Thinking about it, shrugging and agreeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, choose a good goal first." Fran said, "Dunna, Feidu is a prestigious family, if their family has an important Members are kidnapped and will pay a large ransom at any cost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant boxing has not heard of the name Dunawen, in fact he does not understand the fee at all The rich people of the capital, "That is him." Krigan said, "Get off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are going on a slow day, on the road, Fran purchased some herbs and minerals in the town. “I can configure the syrup to make the skin black. Of course, after careful brushing with hot water, I can recover.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;~nbsp;&nbsp;Until half a month later, Fran returned to Feidu, a city full of memories and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing half a mile away from the city wall, Kregan greedily looked at the endless trucks. "This is not a few dozen Caesars, just grab a car." "We will send it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you can't find the place to sell dirty, and there are patrol cavalry patrols on the main road at any time." Fran warned, "If If you don't follow my plan, then break up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, listen to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "For the time being, wait for me outside the city, I will do something private." Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what are you doing at this juncture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be back in a few hours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;福Lan wants to visit Mr. William. He hasn't seen it for more than two years. Last time, with the Red Bird Theatre, he didn't have time to meet the best friend and mentor. Fran bought some red wine and fish in the port. For the mage who was addicted to the alchemy experiment, he could only use the black bread as a staple food. The wine would affect the concentration and the meat could not be stored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, occasionally improving the food is also a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He specially asked the merchant for a big basket, half a basket of wine and meat. In the shoal of the remote place, Fran took off his wig, clothes and shoes. Fold it over the food and place the basket on the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When naked swimming for a few hundred meters, Fran urged a ring that blended with flesh and blood to turn the body shape back to Quasimodo. Looking at the reflection on the water, the ugly giant smiled and waited until the Master Tower, and he had to look for William's borrowing robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiu Haili is not too long in the excitement and strong arms to beat the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coral islands and towers are still worn out as if they were in memory. The wooden door on the first floor collapsed on one side and had been covered with sea salt and white salt left behind by evaporation of sea water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was broken when Fran escaped from the sewer and sought help from the Master. Apparently William was lazy to not repair it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. William, I am coming to visit you." Fran stood in the hall, waiting for the Master's answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quietly, only the sea breeze passes through the cracks of the stone and makes a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked up the stairs in confusion. Pay special attention to avoiding the big hole in the seventh step. I remember that at the time when the Master Tower helped William to do the experiment, he was stuck in the hole more than once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This repair, next time I come, bring a piece of wood and tools." At that time it was the prosecutor's Fran proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it always reminds me, be cautious, be careful with the experiment, and go down the stairs, just pay attention to the sun and the stars. But not Pay attention to the people at the foot. Nothing can be done successfully.” William said, looking like a professor wearing gold glasses and teaching knowledge at the university desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor is still in place. The small cabinet and the bed were quietly in the corner, and the dust was dusty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing on the third floor, those closets, tables, experimental instruments are gone without a trace, the ground is also gray soil, only when Fran comes in, step on Clear footprints on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master has already moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan feels very lost. When you suddenly realize that a friend has not been in contact for a long time, he rushed to find him, but found out. The address in memory has long been meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lost is to make the reunion in the future better." Fran sighed, took the bottle out of the basket, screwed off the cork, "cheers I wish you an early success, my old friend," said Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait back to the city. It is already dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Man, you are too slow." Krigan complained that he grabbed the fried fish in the basket and chewed it. The cold fried food was not good. eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franland will buy them from the port, and the sailors often wear clothes and hats to them. "Change clothes, we go to the city. First find a home." The hotel has a good meal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s easy to enter the city, purely the commercial city will not have too many checks, the guards don’t look at them more. The sailors in the Golden Horn Bay are too common. For the guards of the city, it is the right thing to collect taxes on the carriages and goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the old district of Feidu, Fran took the lead with a group of people and came to the golden goose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss is still a smiley face, the table at the wall is still full of oriental merchants, and the regulars are still flirting with the women. flirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two double rooms, come back to eat, the food is based on 20 standards." Fran told the hospitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food is very fragrant and the beer is very refreshing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should we do now?" Shawei remembers their purpose, and some can't wait, "I will never go upstairs to sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
