			<div id="content">In the middle of the night, Moore set aside weeds and walked along the path to the abandoned village. He looked at the gray-blue sky and the shining star. The day was not cold, but Moore still felt the palms wet, his body was cold, and the inexplicable biting chill made him chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a place like a dead country. The original inhabitants left for a variety of reasons, leaving only the abandoned house. The vines and moss turn the ruins into a part of nature. Near the sea, you can see a dilapidated small pier. The wood on the pier is rotten, but the pedestal made of cement and bricks is solid. Not far from the beach, you can glimpse the wreckage of the boat drowned in the sand. Many years ago, this was probably a slag yard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore is a good sailor. He is familiar with all the waterways along the Golden Bay, but has never passed by or overlooked the boat, indicating that the village is far from the standard waterway. Hidden behind an unknown semi-arc bay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked the boss for a month off, like an adventurer looking for a pirate treasure, and found it by the vague clues in the rumors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sophisticated mailbox on the edge of the dock, made entirely of thick iron, with a purple crow on the mailbox. He put the "Please help me" note into the mailbox and left the address. Moore stayed in the town hotel forty miles from here. After three days, he came back for dinner and found a letter on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard your voice. Come to the dock at five in the morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no signature, only a crow's seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of curiosity, Murt intended to inquire about the small village’s things, the boss thought about it and replied, “Oh, there used to be a slag yard, a lot. The fish rafts in the spring of the year no longer passed nearby, and the fishery was abandoned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does anyone live there?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Occasionally there will be a tramp where it is, but the village is not close to the main road. There is no living facility and it is impossible to live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"So, have you heard of any strange people appearing in the village?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss was busy greeting the guests, and then turned around and answered, "weird People? Oh good guys, there are only weeds, it is estimated that there are no rats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is a resident interface in the town, "the son of the street bread shop owner Doesn't it mean that one day I saw a boat at the seaside near the village?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ship?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very beautiful yacht, not a fishing boat of a few pieces of wood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The kid is a slut, he has no words. Quasi." The hotel owner laughed. Moore recalled that he didn't have a watch, but the sailor could rely on the stars to judge the time. The star told him that he is now estimated to be five o'clock, but he is far-sighted. , around and at sea. There is no shadow. “Is it a prank?” Moore thought. But who knows his purpose and the help letter sent out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint fog covers the sea, and Moore stepped on the cigarette. He nervously touched a cigarette. He lowered his head and slammed the match on the canvas trousers. The sea breeze made the fire impossible. Just when he was going to find a place to shelter from the wind, the sea on the right side, in the fog. There was a shadow of moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are always afraid of mysterious things. In an instant, Moore feels that the blood of the whole body is in the brain. The unknown fear reminds him of the giant beasts and ghost ships that the old sailors often mention. He felt that his feet seemed to be a salt column and he could not move one step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few seconds, Moore just breathed. "Here is land, really a monster, I can turn and run." He comforted himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow is close to a few points, and the outline is gradually clear in the fog, which is a small double-sail fast sailing. The boat was painted black. The sailor's good vision, let Moore see, the bow is like a winged, crow on a balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailboat gracefully stopped at the dock, then a ladder descended from the deck, "Please come up." The boatman said that the crisp voice indicates that the other is a bit A young woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The crow is a woman?" Moore hesitated. He hadn't got rid of the mysterious atmosphere. He couldn't help but think of the legend, the sailor who tempted the sailor and then the meat fled. In the end, the revenge of the psychological prevailed, Moore gritted his teeth, took off his shoes, rolled up his trousers, smashed the sea without knees, and climbed the boat from the ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More beautiful ship, Moore admired, fear has been replaced by curiosity, the sailor’s blood is boiling in his pulse, the streamlined hull, white The triangular canvas is painted with oil and a warm color deck. "This kind of boat can make the rudder alone without the need of effort. The speed is like the wind. It can be forty nautical miles in half an hour." He thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a black cloth towel on the deck, "put him on." The female voice ordered, waiting for Moore to follow the instructions, holding a soft hand. He, bypassing the aisle, came to the boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please sit down, friend." This is another low male voice, pure Byron, with a clear bite. Moore reached out and touched it, and there was a chair next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Mr. Crow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be said that the crow is the guide for the underworld. Man, the dead, is the eye of the god of vengeance.” The man continued, “Talk about your experience. I am willing to listen.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About half an hour, Moore said that he was unfair. "Oh, this is a woman, watery flowers. I loved you faithfully the moment before, but after a moment, I was put into the arms of others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Retaliation! I have to wash and insult!" The sailor was excited. "My Sally is, after all, after all, I loved her, but the man must give him a good look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are many kinds of revenge, there are trials in purgatory, and there are evil gods to play." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want him to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, my friend, he robbed Your lover, but not a crime of death. Crime and punishment It must be fair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore lowered his head and gasped for a long time before he calmed down. "It is done according to the unwritten tradition of sailors! On the ocean, there are Your own law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man seems to be thinking and then replied, "Good, I promise you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guarantees Moore relieved, he suddenly thought of something, "... Excellency, I am a poor sailor and can't get any reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friend, my reward, you can afford it." The man replied gently, "Friendship I need your friendship. If one day. A person with a purple crow seal is looking for your help, you just need to help me like today."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This works 16k novel network exclusive text version of the first release, without permission can not be reproduced, excerpts, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very strange." Lauvita looked at Fran, who was driving the boat, and said, "If you don't have money, you are willing to do it. And come. Not to be rejected, not long ago, you helped the financier to obtain evidence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The son who saved a gangster."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a lot of money." Fran said, "As long as it is enough, it will become."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;光分红,劳薇塔There are hundreds of thousands of Caesars in their private accounts, and their heads are more. For ordinary people, this is a huge amount of money that can sustain two generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you should also do something right, Kreigan took the money, but he summoned a lot of people in the Golden Bay. He didn't want to go back to the west, ready to go. The Gulf region. Rebuild your own gang," said Lauvita. "Sooner or later he will come to the head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be a gangster?" Fran said, "I will leave Golden Bay after completing something. He is also good, at least for now, I have a common goal with Kregan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean Igo Andech?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't get rid of him, Kregan won't feel at ease, and I just want to find that groceries and ask for something." "The road is saying, Ander. Xi Dawei lost in the chaos, but did not know where he is hiding." Lauvita suggested, "Would you like to join forces with the civil strife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No," said Fran. "Sooner or later, I will find him out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Anderch had done to him, Fran had to pay him back one by one. However, Fran had some doubts. Andrei’s relying on the gorse did not make any supportive response. This seems to indicate that the civil strife is also related to the family. Or, this is simply the buffalo's shuffling of the underground world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't matter which side wins. Otherwise, Andech is deeply ingrained and has not fallen so badly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he begins to avenge the gorse, the side of the civil strife will be his enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have money now, it's time to leave these evil things, buy a house, or open a shop, do everything well." Fran to work Weita said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have said this a few times, I love the present life." Lauvita chuckled, she looked at Fran's back and put it back Half a sentence swallowed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you going, I will follow where I go." The girl thought, "The foundation of the gang is that you built it. I swear, it only belongs to you, only Hold on your palm.

Every time I saw a new girl, I was physically, and I wanted to laugh and hold back to comfort his expression. The fat man felt that the man’s self-esteem was deprived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the weak stuff, and screamed in anger. "I don’t use anything, I really want to cut you off." The fat man has eaten a lot of medicine, even I also asked the bishop who mastered the power, but there was still no improvement in softness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently he received the wind, the city has just come to a professor at the University Medical School, is doing some research, can let men at the age of sixty, Can maintain the glory of young people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, surgeons in the secular view, as a wizard-like mysterious fear of occupation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They disintegrate the corpse and depict a variety of dissolving agents. Because it is indeed effective, the church barely recognized the existence of surgery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One morning, the fat man avoided the eyes and ears of others and secretly found the professor. The professor wore heavy glasses and a beard and was living on the fourth floor of an apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full house is a book, a few tables, a lot of glass laboratory equipment, a few bottles filled with antiseptic drugs, loaded with bulls, horses Waiting for the animal's **, the huge size, let the fat man feel deep inferiority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole room is fluttering with the scent of the disinfectant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have invented a method of transplanting animal organs to the human body, the perfect method."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Professor said. The atmosphere in the room made the credibility rise a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whose surgery may fail?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, 100% success." Professor serious Saying, "I am studying how to transplant more important organs such as the heart, but the funds are not enough now, so I can only rely on this to raise money and let the experiment continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"How much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"150,000 Caesar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" However, I am still very scared, in case there is a flash know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Science is not allowed to be any false, it is from hundreds of thousands of cases of data Confirmed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor said, "I will not let my reputation be shamed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The fat man thinks about the majesty that he can show after transplanting. "If I have such a big stuff, there is a woman who is willing to give up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"A contract, you must guarantee success." Under the fat Determined, "And, I will let a few friends be present. If you fail, you have to go to prison for twenty years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Professor refreshed He agreed, he made a contract:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This operation guarantees a 100% success rate, otherwise I am willing to pay full responsibility and be sentenced to 20 years of punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract also details the various steps of the procedure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last professor asked, "Do you want to transplant a horse, or a cow? I will do a little shaping, without losing the size. Let it be more in line." Human shape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ma, the strongest horse!" Fat man gasps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation was carried out three days later, and the fat man brought several friends he trusted and confirmed. He was relieved. After disinfection and anesthesia, the fat man was sent to the modified operating room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friends waited curiously, and there was a lot of discussion. I thought the operation would last for a long time, but in less than a quarter of an hour, the professor took off the gloves full of blood. walk out. "The first stage of surgery was completed." He is rich. Then put a little black and blood with blood. Throwed it into the trash can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can take him away," said the professor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not to transplant the horse..." The friends were shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, the experiment needs further research, wait a few moments. The study is successful, the surgery continues." The fat man who woke up was unhappy, he immediately sent the professor Going to court, this strange case caused a sensation in the city. The church also sent commissioners to the scene to condemn such awkward research. The bishop also said that if the professor was found guilty, he would apply and transfer the prisoner to the religious trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor’s lawyer said with a contract, “Please look carefully, my client. There is no violation of any agreement.” He read, “The surgical procedure is as follows: First cut off the experimenter's organs, then place the organs of the designated animals, and then..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the defendant did not complete the operation," the prosecutor said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, distinguished account, there is no description on the contract, the first step and the second step must be carried out continuously." The lawyer said, "The operation only made half The court can't rely on guessing, and the steps after the operation will definitely fail." "When will it continue?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer laughed. "Maybe tomorrow, maybe ten years later, who knows, there is no provision in the contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial continues from morning to evening, control The party can't get any evidence to prove what hasn't happened yet. "As long as the surgery does not continue, and finally fails, I can't convict, but when it continues, they have the final say." The prosecutor thought that he admitted that the trap was despicable but effective. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge ruled that "the plaintiff lost the case and the defendant did not breach the contract. The operation was approved by the plaintiff. The court held that the plaintiff was voluntarily castrated." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the court, the professor thought, "This is a return to human feelings." He once asked for help from a crow for a certain trouble. Now, he received a letter from the mysterious character and, under his direction, completed the scam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, medical professor, originally in the eyes of the world, is a crazy profession. This matter will not affect his position in the university. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one saw that at the corner outside the courtroom, Moore laughed on the wall and laughed and tears came out. He did not know that this tear is the joy after revenge, or the pain of loyalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the rules of the sailors, seduce someone else’s wife, you have to be smashed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crow, I owe you." Moore rubbed tears and murmured, "I still see you even if your face has never been seen." For the benefactors who bring rebirth, the godfather is majestic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and most Quick chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Igo Andech lost in the bloody war." Vito said, "He is not afraid now, inform the brethren, turn the ground Three feet also found him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have nothing to do with that big man." Someone is puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I owe someone a person." Vito said, he looked at the letter in his hand, the purple crow seemed to stare at himself, "although the stone was not enough." However, in order to repay the human condition, he had to grieve the former big man." He deliberately bit the "front" character very heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vito contacted the crow through the mailbox in front of the old house in Feidu. Out of caution and curiosity, he explored the whereabouts of this mysterious character after the event, and there was no result, as if there was no such person in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, send a few more people to the monastery, I don't want my son to have any mistakes." Vito told him that he knocked on the table and turned his thoughts again. Come back, "It’s like a ghost in the underworld." He commented on the crow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a big deal, I guess there is a 15% profit." In the private club, Harvey shouted excitedly. The people who gathered around him were wealthy men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a lot of money, but the money is also very large." One investor said, "I am willing to enter the market, it is the head you pick." "How much will you come up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three shares, everyone knows my previous losses, things finally solved, the kid went to prison." Harvey Explain, "Otherwise I can account for 50%."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone forgot a problem, smugglers, their bargain-stricken bargains, will disrupt our market. Someone raised a dissatisfaction. "I heard that a large number of goods of the same type were bought by Portuguese and Dutch, but they could not find the entry record." "The damn smugglers, this competition is unfair." The rich men immediately cursed. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The authorities do not have enough power to ban smuggling." Harvey is filled with indignation. "You, we rely on proper channels, legitimate taxation, and we have a pen in front of us." The big money buying and selling, but it can not be achieved because of smuggling. I propose to unite and put pressure on the authorities, at least not let the smuggled goods flow into Byron. "There are more or less smugglers in the room, who have used The smuggling channel for profit-making, but at this juncture, can not let the self-seeing fat but can not eat because of the cheap friendship with the criminals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, I immediately drafted a protest, everyone signed it," said one banker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the crowd, Harvey sighed. He touched the letter inside the pocket. It was the request of the crow. He asked himself to let the authorities at least Within two months, the smuggling of the smugglers was swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have returned your love, don't come to me later." Harvey thought. He is not willing to have too much connection with the mysterious man full of criminals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
