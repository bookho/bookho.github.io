			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like most towns in the West, it’s boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businesses mainly focus on the square in the town center, except for bars that are open all night, they have closed the door, there is no store like a store, all stores are part-time Several kinds of trading, "horses and cars, and also sell dried meat, butter", by moonlight, Fran carefully identified a sign in the shadow, turned a half circle, found in the eighth home on the south side of the square local. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was woken up in the middle of the night, no one would be happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter?" The person who took care of the store pulled the door open and the voice was very depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need an axle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, then you are looking for the right place. Please wait." The merchant re-closed the door, which heard the key unlocking and the sound of the chain sliding on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The store is small, but the goods are complete, "Which type?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wheels, two meters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I recommend this." The businessman pointed at the wall and inserted a row of axles of varying lengths, "Copper Cast, the inside is hollow, so that the car can run more briskly, or take this coffin, both ends are covered with iron cylinders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No traders More than a bit of a tongue, Fran bought a few bags of butter as a lubricant. "Is there a special glass device in the town?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran I bought a set of experimental equipment for pharmacy, and he has left it for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner’s answer apparently disappointed him, if the ordinary glass bowl can still be bought, but the curved test tube and distiller used for research, even at the fee It is not necessarily not bought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The set of Master William is said to be from the distant glass capital: deterrence, specially ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-end glass making process is almost the highest in that city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to Warwick? Fran has no free time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book that was auctioned from Sarah City has not yet touched the clue. Finding an orc who knows those words is definitely better than buying a glass device. More difficult things, like human society, the barbarians of the Black Continent, who are also divided into classes and tribal leaders, are qualified to learn their original culture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan thought, "Maybe I found the entrance to a treasure house, but without the key, I can't confirm it. Behind the door, it is full of wealth, or a stone of ruin." Gravel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When there was a distance from the village, Fran had a bad feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, a lot of beating fire, shredded the night of chaos, just arrived at the entrance to the village, the head of the group was covered with hair, only outside the pajamas A small coat, "I'm missing... Hepburn is gone." She groaned, the desperate look, as if the sky had fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of villagers, holding a Song Ming torch, inspected around the village, "Mrs, can not find people." The respondents said so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barui sobbed, tears slowly squatting down his cheeks, and kept saying sorry to Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calm, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bartui recovered from panic Reason, more than half an hour has passed, and Fran knows the whole process of things from her messy words and other people's remarks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mattida opened her eyes and she had rested in the caravan during the day. Too much to suppress the exuberant energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She moved out of bed, pushed open the window, looking out from the second floor, silent night, gray building, vaguely windy, like sigh The rustling sounded quietly, and gradually dissolved into the depths of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hepburn, little sweetheart." Barry, who was sleeping with her, screamed in sleepy eyes. "Come on, don't catch cold."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't sleep, wait for Dad's gift." Matilda squatted on the window sill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dress is put on." Barry got up, the fatigue of the journey and the lack of adequate sleep, so that her muscles are sore, the neck is hard, "age Big, the body is starting to use." She resentfully looked at the wooden wall, because of the spring moisture, the growth of the mold, "like a piece of rotten wood."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barui puts the jacket and shawl on the bench and puts it on Matida. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your mother, what kind of person?" Carefully smoothed the wrinkles on the shawl<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Mom... I don't remember." Matilda shook her head a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young mother lost her mother, and she was raised by her father. For some reason, she separated and now reunited. In the mind of the head of the team, such a tragicomedy scene emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t think when I was young, but my eyes are almost thirty-three years old. The aging of the years and the wrinkles in the corners of my eyes make the head eager to have a Home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman who has been mixed with dust like her is also picky, as long as the other person can give her a sense of stability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casimomod, it is a good choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this man, always hiding in the mysterious fog, seems to be kind and easygoing, but no one can relate to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is your past?" Barrie looked at the girl, as if gazing at her youth, thinking and thinking, until she was crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night, always scarred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida suddenly put his head out of the window, "as if Dad is back." She cheered, ran out of the bedroom and quickly squatted down the small stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is someone riding a horse in the village, can't see who it is, only the vague shadows, "Casimodo?" Barry quickly pulled out the comb I want to tidy my hair and meet again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after a while, Mattida screamed in amazement, headed down to the head of the building, only to see that at least three knights gathered on the road in the village, talking to each other, one of them was pulling the girl Mounted on the mount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medida struggled, but her strength was never as big as a man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on, kidnap!" Barry screamed anxiously, and the voice alerted the knight. They threw something at the head of the group and soon took it. The girl disappeared at the end of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We went to the town to report to the police? This broken place has not even a security team "Barry said anxiously to Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan squeezed the small purse in his hand, which was filled with golden scorpion, which was thrown at the head of the kidnapper. Walking away from Matida, leaving a purse, it is impossible to be a raging kidnapper. The other party seems to imply: accept the money, don't look for this girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those people, what is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The distance from the night, the night sight Not very good, but their horses are pure white, and they are well-trained and don't scream like a bad horse when they run." Lauren said that he was the one who followed the head and rushed out of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are the three knights going to kidnap Matida? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran believes that no one can be recognized by Byron in the true identity of the Saint Samurai girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those who are mainly the bishops of Annoxin’s church branches, if they are, will not do this at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the style of the Holy See, it will be the entire Knights of the Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless...accepted the person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the Cardinals, who is worthy of doing this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What clothes does Matida wear?" Fran asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's the same as during the day, but with more shawls," recalls Barrie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shawl?" Fran remembered, when she left, the girl's words - "Paris just gave me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no old-fashioned, like a lady's delicate hand, floating in Fran's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Paris sat in the corner, very nervous, uneasily put his hand on his knees, ten fingers twisted together, the bones were white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to have noticed Fran’s gaze, a small voice murmured, “I...I think, those people are coming to me.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris’s words are obviously bigger than everyone expected, and the head of the team is surprised to cover his mouth, “God...” she I don't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavyly choked through the line of defense, Paris closed his head, tears, almost word by word, said, "I know this purse, silver white The stripes, the brownish background, the father's family's badge, is this color."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Family?" Fran is wondering, this purse is well-made, The material is also expensive cloth. It seems that the kidnappers don't care, and they will be seen by the people who care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the yellow-brown walnut flower, the emblem of the Darmack family." Paris smiled miserably, "a baron family in the west of Byron." Perhaps in the eyes of the big man, it is not worth mentioning, but in the eyes of my poor mother, the baron is already a very big master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's very simple The ethical drama, in a noble manor, as a maid's young girl, and her master went to bed, although the other is a 60-year-old man, but the gorgeous clothes, exquisite diet, the servant's envious eyes, let The girl felt that the deep wrinkles on the old man's face were smooth and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a mistake. Everyone wants to live better and work harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that she miscalculated her charm. Not long after, the tired Dalmark Baron sent her a few small sums. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
