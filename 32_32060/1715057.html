Lan thought, "Go to ask the help of Master William? He hasn't left Tantin yet. No, if you really guess that the enemy is another mages or dragons, I will only let friends get into danger. The tower has been alive because of my life and death, and I can no longer let William fall in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he made the decision, "You wait for the news, I go alone." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore cried, "Sir, what do you mean by this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not Do not believe you, but, if you go alone, the goal is relatively small, easy to conceal, unless the team of nearly a hundred people, otherwise a small team of ten people, unless the enemy finds out, can not play other roles."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let me go, you are a businessman, although very burly, but..." Moore stopped the words, he ate Surprisingly, Fran only used his fingertips to give the sturdy sleeve wooden table to the next corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then please. Please be sure to find Miss Whiteman." Moore said heavily, "Whether it is alive or dead." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a more detailed plan was being arranged, a member of the construction team rushed in. "Mul's boss, and Mr. Bo Knight, it seems that there is news of the lady." He looked pale and swallowed his mouth and said to Fran. "We have never seen you before. In order to prevent this, Moore’s boss wants to use the power of the police to report to the police station in a lost way. The case, now the patrol police replied, outside a small town not far from the limestone mountain range, the local police found a female body, the body is very similar to the young lady, the patrol police want us to go ... ...... recognize the corpse... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice is getting smaller and smaller, and in the end, it is almost impossible to hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss missed the news between the mountains, it was impossible to be found outside... the corpse..." Moore’s voice was a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran stood up, "...in any case, I have to go to the small town. Hope is not Lauville."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work 16k novel network exclusive text version of the first release, without permission can not be reproduced, excerpts, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind was almost sweating, and when he was brought to the stables, his legs were softly on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran did not stop and went directly to the local police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the Knight of the Knights?" The inspector who received him was very surprised. "Please forgive me, who is your deceased?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably a friend I missed not long ago, I only hope that I will not see her later." The inspector knows to identify the bodies of relatives and friends. It was a great torture, and he sighed sympathetically. "You come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road from the office to the morgue is not long, along the way, The inspector groaned endlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a very young girl who looks a lot older than my daughter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Yes, Lauvita is very young, it’s all because of me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She was discovered by passers-by in the bushes outside the city a week and a half ago. Fortunately, it is late autumn. The weather is not hot, otherwise we It has already been buried."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran seems to see that the black soil is holding. Slowly sprinkle on the stiff body of Lavetta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fatal cause is that heavy objects hit the hindbrain and directly cause death. We suspect that the weapon is a hammer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Fran's eyebrows are pumped down, hammer...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come, sir, please wait." The inspector touched the key from the waist. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened, because it was built in the basement, and there was a damp air-conditioning on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small iron bed, the cold body is lying there, thin. It seems to have shrunk water. A layer of brown-black plastic cloth, covering the body from head to toe, because the bed is too small, the two arms hang down and sway slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can confirm the appearance." Fran just walked to the front, his hand was shaking, he just prepared to open the plastic sheet, the movement suddenly stopped, his eyes condensed on the falling hands. Full of mud nails, blue-purple skin...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not Lautta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita does not like to reveal to outsiders that he has Gothic blood, so he always wears thick gloves that are long and elbow. Except for him, no one knows that the girl's left hand has a layer of blue-white horny skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Moore reported the case, he could not describe the most obvious feature to the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran felt a sigh of relief in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter with you?" The inspector saw Fran standing still and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is not the person I am looking for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You haven't seen it yet!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Already confirmed. Also, just heard from you, was it found in the forest on the side of the road?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, is there a problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was not the first case." Fran looked at the fingers of the corpse again. "In the nails, there are a lot of green moss Xue." "The wild is everywhere, I think the victim is struggling when he is killed, and his hands are cut to the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly, these are the aquatic algae of the genus Moss, and the leaves and roots are quite different from those of the land. They die in the woodland, and there is no algae in the nails." Go, "The place of death is by the river, and the fatal wound in the back of the head is likely to be hitting the rocks on the banks of the river. The glued river and the nighttime moisture of the trees will make the clothes look dry and wrinkled, so you Did not judge directly "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspector stayed for a moment and shouted excitedly. "I knew that it was definitely the gangster. The night before I found the body, he was Staying by the river until midnight, if you don't mistakenly think that the murder location is in the woods, you have already caught him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you very much, Sir Alex..." the inspector shouted, but Fran, has disappeared into his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now are you going?" The manager of Ma Wei spread his arms. "But I have to remind you that your horse is already very tired, if it is again After running for twenty miles, you will definitely stumble and never get up again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I buy one now."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you really have a very urgent matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the police station is not Lavetta, the girl may Still in the limestone mountains. Go straight to the mountains from here, as long as half a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carries a map drawn by Waff and a few days of dry food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just riding a new horse, walking out of the city gate, preparing for Mercedes-Benz, Fran heard a panting voice, "Mr. Knight, she is back, White Miss Mayn is safe and sound!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fate is today, ignoring Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Moore is one step late, or if Fran does not have time to buy a horse, then he will successfully find the cave where Wave has stayed and find work. The narrow road between the hills and the Vita guns, find the mountain basin in the cliff, find the hidden gray shadow valley manor, and see his lost cherished wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter whether he no longer recognizes him, or the leader of the movie king, Joe Corleone, he hates him. As well as a large number of dragons, they can completely destroy him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss is so numerous that I must stop you. She has extremely important things to report to you." Tone, preach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Laugha is okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I received some less serious injuries. The person is also much thinner, but it is fortunate to be able to come back alive. I look at the expression of the lady, she is indeed alive and dying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran silently Turn the horse's head and follow the road when you come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
