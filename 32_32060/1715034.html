			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. The news of the assassination of the stagnation, arrived in Tirolai with a mail, newspaper and government official documents after half a week. And Paris apparently didn't think about it. It was related to herself. In fact, she gave her lover Lamy a sum of money and asked him to find a few gangsters to get rid of the lover's lover. In the days of drunken fans, the matter was gradually forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Thursday, this is a normal day of calm. Paris was satisfied with a member who was mostly a local warm-up club. At the salon of the genius, she became the focus because of her nominal cousin relationship with Peggy. Everyone was surrounded by her. I want to find out the gossip that can show off to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I haven't seen my cousin for a long time." Paris, while pretending to detach, arranged some sensational gossip. "It seems that there is a handsome knight." Shao Zuo, obsessed with his cousin, may be the case, the plot of the city is the product of love and hate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ladies of the ladies are holding their chests, 睁The big eyes, the exclamation, let the female baron cool into the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After embarking on the carriage, Paris was still relishing the feeling of becoming a central figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back." She said to the coachman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." The driver who wrapped his body in the windproof cloak raised his whip and vaguely agreed, and Paris did not find the other person's physique. There are some subtle differences with your own private car driver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wonderful night soon became a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she found out that the carriage did not return to her home, she drove to a deserted open space in the west of the city, and the driver became a stranger. When she looks like a fierce man, "kidnapping!" She fell to her seat in fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kidnapper frowned, he did not see, his accomplices, appeared in the open space within the specified time. But it doesn't matter, the woman who is dealing with the power of the hand. More than one person is more than enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chick, don't behave in a rebellious manner, this is good for you and me." He threatened to smother the female baron's socks and blocked them. She was preparing to yell in her mouth, and then use a finger to thicken the rope, pack the goods, and bind Paris to a strong one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The three fools. If you miss Miss Whitemane, they will have them look good." The kidnapper squatted, closed the door, touched a cigarette, and he looked around, but there was only a black enchanted shadow in the open space. With his mouth, the spark of ignorance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of the female sergeant, they should be here and put on an unlicensed black car. Quickly leave the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly put a gun on the back of the head. Let the gangsters hit and understand why the accomplices are wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"螳螂螳螂螳螂, the oriole is behind. The oriental proverb is in line with the current scene.” A man’s irony came from behind, and then it was dull. The gunshots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man put the pistol back in his pocket, leaned over, put his hand on the kidnapper’s chest, confirmed that he had died, nodded slightly, then climbed carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not immediately untie the ropes on Paris, but said in a cautious tone. "You are in a very dangerous situation now. If you don't want to know something from your mouth, I can't help you to save you. So you have to listen to me, otherwise you will throw it at the cruel gangsters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris paled his face, groaning from the depths of his throat, nodding his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When damn socks. When she took it out of her mouth, Paris coughed a few times, then gasped and shouted, "I know you, you are the secretary of the Tanjung Justice Hall, Longchi!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increasingly rehabilitated body of His Royal Highness, the potion that came back to life, and the mysterious wealthy Lord Ingmar, like wildfires spread by the wilderness, quickly became the hottest topic nowadays. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medical scholars wrote an analysis of the formula of miraculous healing drugs. Originally, medicine in this era was inseparable from mysticism. Someone has vowed to swear that the potion should contain the elements of the female root of the mandala. This legendary plant, in the mystical school, has always had the reputation of the magic potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church kept silent on this matter and was grateful that the potion was the only bottle, and the remaining weight was used in the storage area. After all, the healing power has always been the gold signboard of the church gods. If other schools surpass them, this is undoubtedly a heavy blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The editors of the tabloids focused on the precious porcelain bottles that were medicated, and the article was also interspersed with the Lord’s adventures in the East. There have already been publishing houses, and I am eager to send a letter to Fran, inviting him to write a memoir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the current upsurge, the company can guarantee that sales will be at least 50,000. You may not value the meager remuneration, but the agency still decides to pay royalties. Determined to be 20%, the company has respected you. Of course, if you are busy, this society sends a highly qualified biographer, you only need to take two hours of free daily in a week. It can be dictated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran was reading the letter and the recent newspapers in the carriage. "The situation is in a tolerable range." He thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resurgence of life, the impact on the world, is clearly imaginable horror fever. No one wants to get a chance to live more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lianfan’s monarchs will worship him, but at the same time, various forces will restrict him. When a status-respecting treatment machine is not the pursuit of Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he made up the scam of the potion and stressed that it was an unexpected income in his adventure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A potion master, although mysterious, does not deviate from the scope of mortal knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He converges on his thoughts and looks out the window. The carriage has just driven through one of the middle sections of the Silver Avenue, at the crossroads, heading towards the Huangcheng District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After regaining consciousness, Peggy moved from the hospital to the Jinweiwei Palace for recuperation. For the sake of etiquette, Fran is ready to visit once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big lady of the Golden Sparrows has recovered well, and she is leaning on the bed and the velvet core cushion. Exquisite brocade rugs, colorful stained glass, ivory wall hangings with pine vines and lacquered sandalwood furniture accumulate a bouquet of rich and fragrant flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire wall facing the courtyard was opened, and a large floor-to-ceiling window was opened, which was half open, and fresh air rushed into the room. The fragrance of the fragrance is floating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
