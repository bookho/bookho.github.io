If it makes me feel uncomfortable, then there is no value." The babysitter can't forget, only a few years old. The child declared to her in a mature tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy is used to categorizing the things around him, and by labeling the interests, can help her, can make her happy, and cause trouble, Disgusting... Wait, etc. She uses her brain to price them and is ready to bid or destroy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be some more subtle things that cannot be measured by normal values. Peggy is dismissive. In her world, everything should be safe and secure. The conspicuous place of the window. Or covered with spider web corners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for mercy, suppleness, and even love, it is a weak thing, and Peggy does not like her weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Colosseum, she should be the last gladiator; in the wild jungle, she should be the top beast of the food chain; in the burning city In, she should take the sword to cut down the enemy's first level, strolling between the fire and the body of the Valkyrie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always better than others. This is the only purpose for Peggy's survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the world, living, you have to face compromise. Peggy learned about the family's secrets through certain channels a few days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinschmann needs to be very friendly with the emperor. When the master of a country is not the same as the most powerful family, it will face the result that everyone is unwilling to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like two tigers, they earned bruises when they snatched food. But after eating. Still have to decently return to their nests, otherwise continue to use their claws to communicate with their teeth, and they will only peep into the coyote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need for a buffer point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden Sparrow has been a four queen. It is time for the fifth queen to appear. The candidate, the default is Peggy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, for political gain, Peggy was tagged and ready to sell. It may be a matter of glory for others, but for Missy, this is a shame. Only she decides the future of others, not others to decide her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present is holy. Honorable Joan VIII, almost fifty years old, and His Royal Highness is only a young boy. It is said that Joan had suffered poisonous killings before he was enthroned, and he was lucky enough to pick up his life, but his health was destroyed, at least since he was in his thirties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the family finally decides, then Peggy must choose a husband from the old man who has problems with sexual ability and the child who does not know anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy bit his teeth and close the window. But she suddenly noticed that something went wrong. Until now, the maid has not pushed the door in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness behind him, there is a vague shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Peggy screamed, hoping to get the attention of the guards outside the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive my offended, respected lady." The figure replied, "My name is Ann Corleone, I think you know the name of my brother. I came here after receiving your kind words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Shadowwalker’s sister?" Peggy is not used to talking to others in the dark," The lights are destroyed by you? Is the underground world assassin dealing with the owner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive me. I must dive to not cause others. Attention. And darkness is the best camouflage.” Ann Corleone snapped a finger and the crystal light re-lighted as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy looked at the visitor. She was a young girl with blond hair and a small body wrapped in a dark cloak. Most of her face was also covered under a face towel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl handed a letter to Peggy, who opened the lacquer on the envelope and took out the stationery and tokens inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I mean you and the shadow performer are clear, but I don't think that if you don't even show your face, there will be sincerity." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your, before the official signing of the contract, no money will be given to the buyer before the payment is made. Similarly, after you officially contact us Before the cooperation, I will not give you the true appearance. For the assassin, the camouflage of the appearance is also a hidden means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not afraid of being offended , let this cooperation fail?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You need us, we also need you, a lot of people, don't mind this little thing." The other party replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is considering my weight? Peggy thought with interest, she gestured to the other person to sit down, but Ann Coleon said slightly, "Hello, we are in front of you, we have no place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;噢, know how to express compliments, but also the courage to bargain, is a good woman. At least it is stronger than the delicate embroidered pillows in the capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, you want us to trust, but many details are not yet clear, independent, or replaced." Ann Corlein asked, she and her brother must To figure out the true intention of the lady is to let them separate from the gang of Igo Andech, become the private arm of Peggy, or whether Peggy wants to reshuffle the underground world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She and she both want to be the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Igo Andech’s power is too great, and his father is too kind to him," Peggy said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand, but I hope that you can send soldiers, and we provide Andre’s conclusive intelligence." Ann suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Peggy’s move by the family. She can’t let her father notice. “It’s impossible, let the shadow practitioner solve it by myself. I can guarantee the gorse. I won’t be annoyed and retaliate against you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andechi speaks in the underground world, and the Round Table Council supports him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That doesn't matter to me." Peggy chuckled and then arrogantly Said, "I can't do anything about this, what do I want you to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An silence for a while, "as you wish. You promised Please do something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andech’s head is the testimony of the covenant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Your will will be Anderse's fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Coleon retreats and disappears into the shadows, as usual There is no trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy smashed the letter and threw it into the fire. "Give me a cup of hot tea," she shouted. The maid soon appeared in front of the door, carrying a shallow silver plate, and the teapot on it was steaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The light just went out, I told you why you didn't agree." Peggy put a few squats around the delicate face back to the ear, feel free to ask Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss, I have been outside, I really didn't hear you talking, and I didn't see the lights in the back room." The servant responded in panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wonderful ability, Peggy thought. She needs a private soldier who only listens to her, right, only listens to her alone, not the entire family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Frey is on the sidelines, he is standing in one of the intertwined highways between the towns of the Golden Horn, and the carriage is parked on the side of the road. Little Biss lit a bunch of dry branches and weeds, and his face was full of smoke. A pheasant was thrown away with feathers, and the oil dripped into the fire, making the fireworks burn more vigorously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are we going to go?" Fran asked, he was still asleep for a few days before he just woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two days, this is extended to three days, just out of the city, he can not restrain the fatigue, fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already entered the hinterland of the bay, but I have encountered unfortunate things." Kregan sat on the stone, and the shoes were chewed with chicken bones. "After a certain town in the morning, it is the foothold of the old businessman Aifu." Originally, I was looking for him to get some money, but he actually died a few days ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get some money?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really tiring to talk to someone like you. In the west, I took care of the old Aifu business, and he is a person who lives and sells stolen goods, and has a lot of black market auctions. I made a lot of votes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that I am in trouble, he always gets some blood to help. But a fire in the genocide, so that the guy can no longer enjoy it. The accumulated family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small Bis interface said, "Without money, we have to consider the next step."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you have money, you can say anything. I wanted to go to the smuggler's boat and go abroad for a year or two. This road will not work. The smuggling guests will not recognize people." Root display Very depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, let's get the money first." Fran said, "Of course, with reasonable means."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe Corleone issued an order at the gang branch outside of Hyde City, "Put the guys and report intelligence at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The head means to let them die." The leader of the branch questioned, according to his ideas, straightforward resolution, this matter is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andre’s leader ordered me to take over the division." Joe looked at the other’s face. "What do I say, you don't need to understand, you just need to implement it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to make a bad decision. What Joe wants is a dragon who is willing to sell for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe I should first inform the head." The branch leader insisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer his cockroach’s green hands on his neck, “Look at the guys.” Joe repeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the division coughed and glanced at Joe with a sly look. "The consequences are borne by myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
