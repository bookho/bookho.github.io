			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. By the contact address on the business card, His Royal Highness and his bodyguards quickly found the mid-range rental apartment, which is a four-story long and wide The brick building is made of gray-white marble veneer, surrounded by black lacquered railings. Most of the tenants are senior white-collar workers in Feidu and tourists who have long vacations and hate hotel-style accommodation. In the foyer, there was a janitor wearing reading glasses and reading the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief of guard, Harry, is a cautious and sensitive middle-aged man with gray hair and a flash of light in his eyes. He worked for the blood knight for twelve years. Effectively and thoughtfully deal with various emergencies, responsible for the safety of the royal staff and the safety of attending the ceremony. More trustworthy, he always knows how to silence and know what to say and what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his request, the Crown Prince gave up the idea of ​​jumping off the carriage immediately with dissatisfaction. He muttered, "I don't want to be like a child. It is maintained in strict condition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, your identity determines that we must do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, I would rather be an ordinary person." Julius looked at the passers-by outside the window. "Hey, they can go anywhere and make any new friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone knows the idea of ​​the Crown Prince, it is estimated that he will, "I would like to exchange with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People always get bored with the class they are in, and instead envy those who are far less than him. This is indeed a trivial phenomenon in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards circled around the apartment, taunting the surrounding roads and alleys, making sure there were no hidden gangsters nearby, and then he walked in In the foyer of the apartment, ask the janitor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are looking for Mr. Ward on the fourth floor?" The old janitor flipped through the memo and said to the forehead, "Yes, there is such a person." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is he alone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a very good foreign gentleman, clothing When you wear it, you can only go to the comfortable single-seat carriage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can you talk more in detail?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”Hey, he’s just a temporary tenant. I didn’t say a few words to him, but it seems to be A very talented doctor, with his wife and children, very cute girl, I have seen it once, the body seems to be a little weak, still wearing thick scorpions in the spring, wearing a warm hat." The janitor is somewhat confused. The other party's tone was quite like the spy of the patrol hall. He wondered if the gentleman had committed anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, is the Ward couple currently at home?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a hotel, no cleaning The waiter and waiter in the room, unless necessary, the tenant will not greet me specifically.” The janitor replied, “And there is a road leading to the back door of the street. Many people are close, they are coming in and out, you have to go up in person. To be confirmed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry will turn what he saw and heard to His Highness. Julius nodded. "No doubt, gentlemen, you should rest assured. No gangsters will drag their families to plan things that are not good... Well, let's go from the back door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls of the corridor are painted with white paint. There are seven rooms on each floor, four on the left, three on the right, stairs in the middle, no one in the corridor, and most of the tenants will return at dusk. Home, the doctor rented a house at the end of the corridor to the right, the door closed. Knocking on the door is ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not at home?" Julius frowned, he didn't have time to wait, so he asked, "Can there be a way to enter? Maybe you can find Wo Where did Mr. Deer go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he said this, his face was a bit hot and he was ashamed of his request to violate the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Dragon Knight of the Blood Knight, opening an ordinary door is simply overkill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two seconds later, Julius heard a fine sound from the door lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is open. Please come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor has a scholarly taste in the apartment room, the store is looking at it, the sofa in the living room, the closet, the simple furniture are the things of the real estate company, the cover It’s not fashionable, it’s blue satin dotted with small white dots. There are a lot of books, there are hard paper covers, the cover is dazzlingly luxurious, and the local books are yellow. Most of them are medical books, and there is no special. The bookshelves and books are scattered on the desktop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurricane and Thoughts", "An Analysis of Dreams", "The World of Spirituality", His Royal Highness saw a lot of the Portuguese-Dutch translation of Professor Foyid, apparently the doctor brought with his luggage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residence of a doctor who studies the knowledge, this should be the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives Julius a bit of confidence in the doctor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the people who want to visit under the High Court will not come back in the short term." Harry checked in the room for a while, against Julius Said, "I found a bill for the purchase of fishing gear and household items, the day before yesterday, and the items found in the room were not found, and there was a color printing travel brochure, which was built in a holiday home on the offshore island. He should go out to sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal carriage rides fast, the road The street trees on both sides kept going backwards. Although the two blood knights felt unruly about the sudden decision of the Crown Prince to go out to sea, they were very confident about their strength and felt that even if they were in danger, they could easily solve them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is no need to forcibly block this and sweep the interest of His Royal Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry sensitively perceives that Chu Jun’s urgency is not what he said: he just wants to get to know a new, knowledgeable friend. But the bureaucratic career allowed him to understand obedience and never ask questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After forty minutes, they arrived at the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seaport that provides the cargo function is always a place with a lot of people, very unconventional, drunkards and shirtless porters all over the street, blood knights Jumping out of the car, throwing a coin worth ten Caesar, and throwing it to a man dressed as a sailor, asked impatiently, "Hey, where is the office of the Feidu Ocean Travel Company located at the port?"<br />< Br /> /> </ br> </ br> ; Julius is very interested in the surrounding environment, here is a lively and vulgar occasion, although it is not against the prince's spleen and stomach, but still brought him a lot of freshness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you only give ten dollars for rewards? And can't the attitude be handed to him?" Julius asked strangely, although the blood knights were very proud, they were all well-trained and socially trained. A genuine gentleman, "Not like your style."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, you don't know." Harry said with a smile, "in the port and market It's best to have a small banknote and a pocket. You can pick it up at any time, because once you reveal the money clip full of the check of the big bill, it will cause trouble, and the gangster and thief will treat you as a worthwhile target; and we The clothes are very different from the bitter men who are looking for a job at the dock. They don't belong to a class. If they are weak and can be bullied, they must be careful to be teased by them, such as a wrong road."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is to say. Because of the difference in the environment, it is more convenient to change your attitude appropriately." Julius thought nodly, these tips are small, Is not a deep ban and aristocratic luxury communication , The school can get. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage quickly disappeared into the crowds of the crowd, as if it had never existed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailor was still fresh in his memory. Two days later, when questioned by the patrol hall, he answered nervously. "Yes. I have seen the pedestrian, hey, I have also rewarded me for ten dollars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius and his servants. It disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire fee is confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byron’s big event, the news that Chu Jun was kidnapped did not affect the daily life of the southern village. The nouns of the city, the royal family, and the big men, these terms are too far away for the villagers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jebelon god is wrapped in a thin blanket, the air in the early morning mountain tide is very uncomfortable for the elderly, his a little rheumatic knee is faintly painful, but dawn The church bell must be ringing, it represents the beginning of the day. The Father of the Kingdom of Heaven, through the sun, inspects the evils of the world, and evades the safety of believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clock hangs on the roof of the chapel, supported by a wooden shelf, and a ladder rests beside the wall behind the house. Every morning, the old gods will get up on time, climb the ladder to the roof, and ring the small iron clock in an unimpeded manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villagers have become accustomed to listening to the bells to get up. The women prepare breakfast, and the men can sleep a little longer because the subsequent work is more difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old god climbed up the eaves with difficulty. His legs were trembling uncontrollably, his knees were sore and sore, he sighed and held his hand in one hand. The chimney, struggling to stand up straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roof of the church is the highest place in the entire village - although it is only three stories high, other dwellings are low-rise houses - old The gods look around the village. He can tell who lives in every room, how many people, and whether there are children who should start school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am old." He thought, "It will not last long. If I am dead, who will take care of these "People's pets?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head, holding the rope tied to the clock and pulling it hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"铛...铛......铛......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dog snoring, chicken snoring , open windows of the ring, the bell in the waves, the whole village woke up and restore vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old god rested his hand and walked down the ladder along the way. When climbed half, the elderly leg slid slippery, kick Ta, falling straight down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news of the injury of Ji Bolun’s god was quickly spread throughout the village. Everyone was worried. Twenty years ago, they had regarded the gods as the backbone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, when you are older, your legs are a little unfavorable." Ji Bolun smiled and comforted everyone. Fortunately, the house was a dish, and he fell on the crisp. On the soil, there was no glory on the spot, but there was a large bruise on the body. The most serious one was the left arm. It was painful and could not move. The god suspected that the bone was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents raised funds, rushed to the town early in the morning, invited a doctor, but the doctor said that it fell too much, the whole body was pressed to the left arm, forearm fractures, can not be undone with a splint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is a big city, there should be more advanced instruments that can perform complicated operations." The doctor told everyone when he said goodbye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just when everyone talked about making some money, and selling the iron to the big city, the god refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t waste money, and I’m a clergyman after all, and I’ve been examined by a surgeon, it’s overstepped, not to mention surgery.” God said, “Although Anno has ignored modern medicine as a heresy school, but I still have to adhere to the principle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local regional church can’t find treatment after receiving the news The priest of the field, the decline of the magic can be seen, the regional bishop is very concerned about this matter, and promised to seek assistance from other areas. In a cathedral sixty miles away, there is a bishop who can release three minor cures every day. Deacon, but the one who was invited by a wealthy businessman a few days ago to treat the businessman’s son for a cold, could not come at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorrow is shrouded in the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old god was lying quietly in bed, he thought in his heart, "It seems that I am finally summoned by the Lord, but unfortunately, there are several children, not yet If you can give more time, at least let them learn to settle accounts..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Matilda will send the crying children Into the bed, she sat on the fence of the back room, looking at the vast river of stars, hesitated for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up and went back to the wooden house, in the hallway, she could hear Xiao Ai’s whimper in her sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s room is on the far side, and she walks in slowly. The gods are half faint and half awake, from time to time suffering from endless pain, and unconsciously swaying gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Law: Comfort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Law: Expelling Pain."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Law: Rehabilitation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue and white shimmer, flickering in a narrow room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl meditates on the curse, sweating, and the holy samurai of Anno specializes in the cultivation of martial arts and disciplines, even if Ma Tida is Known as the genius of the century-old genius, it is also impossible to display a medium healing that can instantly heal the wounds of the elderly. The continuous release of the healing system has already brought her to the limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the old gods have been life-saving and worry-free. They have been nursed for two months and can slowly recover their health. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The physical strength is almost overdraft." The girl frowned, slightly breathing, she wiped her sweat with her sleeves and wanted to quit quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are... the holy warrior named Matilda Hepburn, who is looking for the General Court of Anno?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft voice made her body stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man half squinted, already woke up, looking at her kindly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matida opened his mouth and couldn’t say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I am a normal god without a place, I still see what the glory of the holy warrior looks like." The old man said, "And a few months ago." Byron’s deacons in each church have received orders to find your whereabouts, as if Anno had sent a commissioner to arrive in Tantin.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Commissioner? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard from the regional bishop, called Carthof Motovita, directly entrusted to the noble Pope. "Gatamo Motovita... Matilda’s face changed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, although I don't know what happened, but at least now, your mind is completely awake, you have chosen not to return to the Holy Court. , not being coerced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...reluctant to go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why "The old god asked, he immediately smiled again. "I shouldn't get to the bottom of it, because I only know what I do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Grandpa, please allow me to call you this." Martida called. "You think that as a saint warrior, I am against the order of Anno, even want to stay away from it, the farther the better, such me, has it fallen? "Already 亵渎?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The holy warrior is the servant of heaven, the sword and sword that serves the Father." The old god replied, "And Anno, can't On behalf of the supremacy of the will, ha, I am really a deviant old thing, so big rebellious words are also spoken. But I still have to say, the Lord walks in each In the heart of the disciples, you have to ask yourself whether he is still, whether he still respects him, and the definition of depravity and defamation does not depend on the majesty of Anno, nor is it determined by other people’s views. It is your own heart to guide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
