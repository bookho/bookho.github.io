			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the narrow ramp, walking in the dense tombstones always makes you feel gloomy, as if the air is covered with an invisible haze Wings, let the sun not be warm and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common calamus in the cemetery, the pale white flowers that always stubbornly occupy every inch of the sun-protected corner, are hard to see, obviously in front In the strange riots of the time, they were dug together with weeds and buried in the decaying soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, what did you find?" Inspector Lyme, who accompanied William, tried to ask in a relaxed tone, not letting others notice the heart. Anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two years of the midnight butcher, now the group of corpses have played through the world, there are always some mysterious cases, like a whip, he can’t stop and take a good breath. Take a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is a vicious criminal, Inspector Lyme is confident that he can use his sword to subdue, but this kind of unreasonable, invisible case, The inspector is really unable to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Demon Peak is very calm and has not used traces of the Arcane." William replied, "Maybe it would be more effective to find a Master of Prophecy, my Areas of expertise are enchantments and changes, not suitable for large-area searches."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you see, will it be some evil that holds the power of supernatural power?" What do you do, such as the Necromancer?" the inspector speculated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William blinked and stared at the inspector for a while. "Please believe that if you are a little involved in arcane, I will not stay." Disciplining in a sensible manner, because these words insult the dignity of the arcane manipulator, the necromancer is only a branch of the multi-ethnic school, it does not have a good or evil saying. Perhaps I should explain in more detail, good Let you no longer produce such ridiculous reasoning. A Master apprentice can control at most two skeletons. If you are a master of the undead, the limit is only twenty skeletons, which can make the death of the entire cemetery almost instantaneous. The life may only be done by the legendary Necromancer in the record, but a legendary mage who can smother a demigod and destroy a city in his mind will live in a dilapidated cemetery, inexplicably wasting precious media and mana. Just let the dead people in the underground climb out to see the moon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I apologize for what I just said." The inspector pressed his hand to his chest and apologized for a knight. "Can the master give me some advice, point me in the fog?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The resurrection of the deceased is not a patent for undead spells. In fact, the masters in this area are the bishops who are waiting in the church and specializing in praying. The magic is unique in the field of soul and healing. However, just as the legendary mage only exists in the ancient records, the priest who can master the great resurrection is also only in the legend. In this world, there should be no more people who can perform the resurrection. Otherwise, he It will be the object of worship by every monarch who loves life and wants to sit on the throne in an immortal way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master’s words, not all of Lyme’s inspectors Understand, but he understands that the initiator of this case is definitely not the confrontation of a small inspector in a certain city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s thirty years ago, he’s still a swearer, he may swear to find out the truth for the knight’s honor, but the older the person, the more Rejecting the call of the Lord, he does not want to be a tragic hero who blocks the dragon with the ants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the inspector sighed helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Master is very excited. For a mage who is obsessed with arcane experiments, this inexplicable and inexplicable force is undoubtedly wonderful. The subject of the study, maybe he can pull from the corner of the legendary spell in the historical ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the most chapel in the capital of the Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden enamel pattern along the white altar, depicting the sacred pattern, a large collection of mulch from the sacred cemetery and several sections of bones stacked Above the altar, under the call of the Faction, the gray-scarred earth emerged with a glimmer of holy light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop of Roland whispered a few words, and the spell of the magic seemed to trigger the commotion of the halo. For a moment, the entire altar was shrouded in golden light. The golden particles of light diffracted in a small room, and the yellow bones on the altar became pink and crystal, and even the periosteum attached to the top was visible. It is hard to imagine that it was buried underground for decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the bishop of Ivan, who is not proficient in the magical technique, can feel the majestic power hidden in the light column. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miracle lasted only a few seconds. After the scene in the chapel returned to normal, Bishop Ige crossed the cross. He trembled and whispered in a voice that almost collapsed. "Let the dead resurrect, and life will never die. It is really the power of the Eternal Cabinet. Praise the seal of light, the supreme authority and purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now is not the time to praise." Red The bishop was long and gasping. He grabbed the bones and cut it off. He watched a few drops of white bone marrow slowly falling. "I immediately reported to the Holy See that I need the full assistance of the Holy City. Rio Anger The remaining party of Sri Lanka actually mastered the method of using artifacts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After searching for two years in Feidu, he finally found the trace of the stolen artifact, Roland swears Never let it slip away again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third week after the summer, Fran in the Golden Goose Tavern Received a large box of herbs ordered, the box was divided into twelve small cells by thin wood, each material was safely packaged, and the easily broken shins were carefully wrapped with lambskin mats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arif, the big businessman who sailed on the Spice Road, did have its own merits, as evidenced by the attitude and quality of service. It’s no wonder that the bankers at Feidu claimed that, with the name of Arif, they could borrow 100,000 gold Caesars from their hands without any guarantee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only downside is that the charges are too expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the prosecutor is not a low salary, entrusting him to bring back a batch of herbal materials from the East, there is some pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Study is really a luxury that rich people can enjoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran couldn’t help but think of Mr. William, the first court honorary mage who tried to create a new metamorphosis. He guessed that the cost of each magic experiment was It may be a huge sum of money that shocks ordinary people and curses the unfairness of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since two years ago, since the Master’s Tower had met Mr. William, every week of the week, under the permission of the Master, Fran always took time. Help the mage complete the experiment, and the reward is in the field of herbal medicine, can give pointers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to William's guidance, for the master of the mastery of alchemy, herbalism is just a basic knowledge of enlightenment, and occasionally a few good comments can make Fran benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Herbal, mineral, alien anatomy, theory of everything, astrology, these knowledge constitute the cornerstone of alchemy research, just focused on herbs, can not win Amazing discovery." The Master always said so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, this is just a hobby to let your free time squander, and a sanctuary for one of my elders to escape from the pain, human energy It is limited, that is, to defeat the despicable prisoners in the court, and to attempt to understand the profound alchemy, it will only make both sides flow on the skin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a pity However, although you are an arcane idiot, but your head is good, your mind is quick, if you can abandon the common things, you don't need ten years, you will become a full-time experimental assistant that every mage dreams of." William seems very sorry, "a match The tacit assistant is worth a few bags of precious magic materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the theory of the East, there should be a name for the joints of my elders. The rheumatism of the bacteria can only relieve the pain by the efficacy of the wind. It is said that plants such as white peony, blood vine, and clematis can effectively eradicate rheumatism, but these plants have never been seen, and they do not know the specific Formula." Fran asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William shook his head. "My knowledge in herbal medicine is limited to the fit between plant media and magic, and I can't do anything in the field of medicine." After thinking, I went on to say, "According to the records, there was a witch doctor named Shaman in the orc kingdom of the Black Continent. Their understanding and application of plants is better than Druid. The potion is the masterpiece of the shamans. But the battle of a hundred years ago made the civilization and mystery of the orc kingdom become the broken sand of the continent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic Pharmacy? I really hope to see it." Fran followed with a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of money, the wisdom of the mentor, and the collections that every wizard never lacks, so that Fran has a rapid improvement in his knowledge. He can tell the characteristics and valuable ingredients of hundreds of plants, and also master several small formulas that match plants to create wonderful effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summer, the mosquitoes are expelled from clean insect repellent water, and the universal anti-toxic agent that can inhibit the toxicity of several snakes is not a great invention, but Fran feels very practical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once said, "I always think that the value of real gadgets is not worse than the big ones. At least in the eyes of a person bitten by a poisonous snake, anti-drugs are more great than the system that illuminates the mysteries of the stars. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran also envisages selling the formula, making small money to make up for the household deficit caused by the research, and the deworming water is left out because of a weak But the smell is not good, the quality of pure oriental herbal deworming water is expensive, people who can afford it, prefer to be bitten by little bugs, and do not want to become jokes in the upper circles because of the strange smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only one who loves only William, he doesn’t care what the smell is. In fact, when the wizard is fully engaged in the experiment, the taste of the body is not only weak. "Oh, there is nothing more uncomfortable than being bitten by a mosquito on the nose during meditation." William said with a bottle filled with medicinal juice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-drugs were sought after, and the last Mamouk merchant bought the formula with five hundred gold Caesar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the desert of Mamuk, there are many snakes that are as golden as sand. These vicious death gods are absolutely for those who accidentally step on it. No mercy. I hope this will come in handy." The businessman is in a good mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan feels quite fulfilled, he swears, "Maybe, after a few decades, I can go to a university to be an honorary professor when I retire, not The law is the pharmacy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pursuit of knowledge, expensive, but always satisfying and fulfilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that not long ago, in the smoking room, the lady of the Reinschmann family felt humiliated, and Fran had not talked to her for two weeks. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasional encounters in the corridors of the first court, only get cold eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer bother him, no longer use the power behind him to force himself to do reluctance, to use the Codex Ordinance to interrogate criminals and to prosecute The officer felt very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Fran is still aware of the slightest uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young prosecutors are really reluctant to bow their heads, to a lover who insults him, and to apologize and yield to those who despise their morality and integrity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can you take the conscience and use the law that should be majestic and fair as a tool for the future?” Fran thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social experience tells him that offending a noble person is usually nothing to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being driven out of the judiciary, returning to the broken houses of the old district to live a poor life, away from their dreams? The sages of the martyrdom, only fools will be "The rational reason advises Fran, let him not have nothing for the ethereal exercise, cheap restraint." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran in the eyes of his peers, has always been shrewd and strong, but privately, reason and sensibility in the mind tangled, as if the dark mist of chaos, let him Confused to recognize the direction of the forward. Fran is a wise man who can estimate the future of each choice. But wise people often stand in front of the forks led by wisdom and feel contradictory and confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecutor who had been temperate in smoking habits began to sneak up on An Mei and secretly bought cigarettes at tobacco shops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dawn, the light dawn makes the newly changed guards see There was a slow-moving shadow on the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the rising sun rises slowly, the dark blue sky is occupied by the magnificent golden halo, the black is swallowed, and it is blended, and the faint stars are still present. In the irresistible majesty of the majesty, quietly retreat behind the scenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the bright light shines, the outline of the shadow is clear, and the scouting cavalry, who is visiting, is surprised to find that it is a team of nearly a thousand people. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spears of about four meters are raised high, and the white background flag on the tip of each spear floats in the wind, and the flag is covered with bright red The cross stripes, on top of that, depict a V-shaped pattern of crossed swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Gok rider wraps his body in a silver plate, as can be seen from the fine iron rings that appear at their joints, in the armor, At least still wear a layer of chain mail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same style as the spear flag, the white cross red robes cloak, covering the back and the entire left half body, which not only makes the knights more solemn, fighting When the leather lining the robes is also the first protection of the defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the gap between the cloak and the waist, a brown hook-shaped handle with a delicate texture is exposed. If you pull it out, you can see more mysterious patterns on the barrel. These images contain the power of the musket. The guns remained cool after the most intense shots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The musket hanging from the waist, the thick barrel from the back of the cloak, revealing a half, with the ups and downs, and the thin iron covered with the upper layer of the horseback Ma Kai collided gently and made a dull metal impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three carriages driven by four horses in the middle of the Cavaliers, the black cross on the carriage reveals the identity of the team, this uninvited guest comes from The throne of the Seal of Light: the holy city of Anno. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, please inform the lords quickly." Scout thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long team continued to move forward for a while, a knight left the formation, and the horse flew to the front. At the gate, she stopped and picked Under the helmet, splendid to the almost transparent white blond hair, a delicate face immediately appeared in front of people, age only around fourteen or five years old, but the dull eyes, devout full of clean expression of the expression The childishness that should have been swept away, she set a ceremonial sword encrusted with gems and gold wires and tapped on the shoulders of the nearest guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lead the way, I am going to the Municipal House," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feidu New District’s Municipal House Building is crowded with people. The officials who received the scout report earlier have been talking. The mayor who just received the notice is slow. After half a step, while sweating, I asked for the latest information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most sacred, supreme, immortal, the authority of the entire nation, the shepherd, the Pope is ordered." The female knight is holding the horse, loudly Shout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The honorable paladin, please petition." The mayor replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight takes out the gold-finished sheepskin roll from her arms and unfolds it, reading it with the cold, but full of vibes,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this kind of ground, the heresy of 亵du lurks, this city is temporarily entrusted to the Holy Knights of the Papal Hall, and immediately closes the gate. All officials are printed by the light. His Royal Highness the Byron Emperor, loyalty and loyalty, must not be violated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
