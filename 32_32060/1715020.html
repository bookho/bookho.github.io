			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Peer passed through the street full of windy places, staring seriously at the front, feeling the air was so dirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a very clean and serious person, very unsocial, never eat the dishes that others have touched during the dinner, no matter how hot the weather, always bring Gloves. Even his colleagues whispered in private. "When the guy is intimate with a woman, will he also use a rubber band to tie a thick cloth on a certain stuff."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the government's general file, Pelostoll is the head of the Security Department's handling of internal affairs, that is, the bureaucracy that never appears on the front line and is responsible for assessing the performance of others. But in the most secret, the red scroll that only a handful of people can access, he is the most hidden department of Tantin: a member of the Blood Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All members of the Blood Knight possess supernatural abilities, which are the dragons who are called by the underground world. This special team is loyal to the royal family and performs the most difficult tasks of secretly protecting politicians, spying secrets and assassinations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street girl on both sides of the street threw his eyes at him, deliberately licking his lips and making a seductive voice. Pei Luo darkly wrinkled his eyebrows, not a clue to the investigation. Pointing to the most sullen area of ​​Tantin, a small bar called Cat Claw seems to hide a sneaky secret society. He will never get involved in half a step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, any clue should be submitted to the confidential office first, and the intelligence officer analyzes the reliability and processing. But the blood knight is always full of confidence in himself, and Pei Luo is the most outstanding member of the department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why can you do the little things that can be done alone?" They laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-confidence to a certain extent is arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyro saw not far away, standing in a uniform wearing a patrol uniform, is laughing with a girl with heavy makeup. He went over and showed his credentials. "I am the Inspector of the Safety Department. According to the rules and regulations, I have the right to dispatch you to do anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The little policeman was shocked. He awkwardly respected and said, "Mr. Inspector, what can I do for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the cat's claw bar? Take me there." Pei Luo just had trouble. From the future, he didn't know how to go, and the morality and cleanliness made him disdain. Dirty rogue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. I know, please come." The patrolman said to the girl next to him, "Hey, sweetheart, cat claws are the place where you work, just together." Go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyro thought in his heart, "Working hours, but preparing to go down with the prostitute, this matter tomorrow I will tell the patrol responsible for the area Director of the Bureau." He followed the patrolman seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning two streets, they came to a dark alley. The street lights at the entrances are not known when they are extinguished. Pelostoll was alert. Standing still, shouting, "Don't you go to the cat claw bar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrolman turned back. There was no expression on his face. "Mr. Stewart, no, the blood knight member known as the Royal Detective, why is he suddenly interested in a small bar, I really want to know."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the shadow of the night, Pei Luo felt that the black waves were coming to him, and there was a feeling of being pulled out. He is on the street, and the two leaders who are free to find are actually part of the secret society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no coincidence. It may be stared at the same time as entering the Fengyue District. In the eyes of Pei Luo, the green mans roll, and the fingers cross over to draw the pattern. In a few seconds, the air in the target lung cavity can be solidified. The strong person can only mourn and suffocate in the pain of internal bleeding. And died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the finger just moved, it was out of direct relationship with the body. Not just the head. Arms, ears, nose, legs, for a moment, the whole person becomes torn apart. The black burly space in the alley is covered with lines that are hard to detect, sharp, and spider-like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a big man colluding with this society, the blood knight's information is mastered by the enemy! This is the last thought of Pei Luo before his death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't overdo it." The patrolman took off his hat and complained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without your reminder, I deliberately kept my head intact, and it’s up to you." Yan makeup, dressed as a prostitute With. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrolman picked up Peero and showed his shocked expression. "Well, let me read your memory and see what the Royal Detectives found. Sorry, according to the command of the Shadow King, we can’t now and the blood. The Cavaliers clash, but it doesn't mean that they will let go of the prey that was sent to the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn't notice that a black blue edge, engraved with a red knight pattern The badge, from the broken clothes of Pero, rolled down to the corner, and the blood-red shimmer flashed a few times and then dimmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran was drinking tea and counting the letter from the mail, fifty-two. In a few well-known newspapers in Tanding, he bought a big price for the book, published the recruitment notice of the Berkshire architecture line, the new company was a waste of new, from manager, finance to clerical, all positions were vacant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this leaked his address, and most of the letters were not job seekers. I was free to think of myself and made a machine that didn’t consume any energy. I shouted for a little. Small money can share this epoch-making invention; small groups of semi-religious nature continually promote unexplained ideas in the lines of words; there is even a threatening letter with a blackmailing nature, which reads: I know your secret, one Ten thousand blocks will make me shut up. The person who wrote this letter probably sent a letter to every rich man who knows the address, hoping that someone who is privately ass is not clean, because he is afraid to let him get a big profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sincerely, they have paid their resumes, and Fran carefully read them, throwing those who are boasting in the trash, and then giving them the honesty. Yes, reply to the specific face-to-face time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he started watching Tandin’s newspaper, for the purpose of mastering information, almost all famous brand-name newspapers or poorly-stated tabloids, França subscribed One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front page of Tantin Morning published the action of the Patrol Police to check the Fengyue District. The report said that the raid did not yield anything. Many rich people who have invested in the city strongly condemned in the interview. They showed that the Fengyue District has always had good law and order, and the behavior of the patrol police is obviously discriminatory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another tabloid that often attracts readers with outrageous reports, with a red headline, publishes a message, "The government tunnel engineering shady." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
