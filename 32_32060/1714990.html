			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Colly Charles is a rigorous honest man. His father is one of the famous profiteers in the Golden Horn. He is mean and superb, no one wants to He does business, but he often gets tighter goods. Whenever the merchants are not allowed to purchase at an unreasonable price, they are secretly in the bottom of their hearts. "This old fox."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this wealthy profiteer has a sincere son. More than once, Charles complains. "His character can't be a good businessman, and my family will be ruined sooner or later."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the death of Charles, people are waiting to see jokes. Pessimistic prophecy is often very effective. After a few years of hard work, the Charles family's industry has been declining. At the most embarrassing time, Conley can only fill the deficit by selling the jewels of his ancestors. The debt is just over twenty-five years old. The young people are both white. Just when it was about to go bankrupt, the opportunity finally came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The son of Connie is six years old. He is a gentle and gentle girl. They are two of them. In a sense, they are stinking, the girl’s father. It is also a businessman who does whatever it takes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although he is my son-in-law, but the business is business, I will not invest money to fill the bottomless pit." The father-in-law refused the daughter-in-law's help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchant is not very concerned about the married woman, he wants to leave the money to the two sons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at the most critical juncture, an emergency has caused his father-in-law to die, and he has been assigned to a small number of family-owned wives. He does not hesitate to take the money out to help. Husband, Conris invested in an ocean freighter to the east. People say that this is the last chance for the Charles family. If the ship encounters a storm or a pirate, then he will only be a bankrupt. Fortunately, the gods began to care for Conris. Six months later, the ship passed through the sea of ​​death without a hitch, and returned with full boat tea and porcelain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Conley’s luck is getting better and better, at the age of thirty. He already has four purchasing lines and one factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich man who turned over the salted fish did not retaliate against the coldness and ridicule of him when he fell down. His business is in good standing and good service, as long as A contract that has signed a name, even if it is a loss, will certainly be honored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have forgotten the old heart of Charles, as long as they talk about Conley, they will say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gentleman, but the gold sign in the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time, one Because of the fighting and theft of the property of the host family, the young man who was sent to prison had just served his sentence, but no factory was willing to hire him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, no one can look down on me, I have done it, even if I am guilty, I am now redeemed." The young man was once again asked from the factory. He stood in front of the door and shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cornlock happened to talk about business from that factory. I heard this. So he stepped forward and said to the young man, "Hey. I have a temporary job, are you willing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, sir, I can't let The old mother is so old, she has to go to the tailor shop to support me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I need to go to the Xicheng factory to get a batch of boxes, but Now I don't have time to go, you can help me." Conley counted ten gold Caesars and ninety dollars of banknotes. "This is the rest of the money, you hand it over to the factory manager."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the young people walked away. Others learned about it and reminded him, "That is a bad embryo. You haven't made a contract. He swallowed money, but you have no choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, he will come back." Conris said, "People are not saints. They will inevitably commit sins in their lifetime. But they cannot be guilty of sin for the rest of their lives because of their past mistakes."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening, when Conley returned to the house, the young man had been in front of the door. "Master, this is the factory's pick-up list. Also, the total payment is 95. Block. You gave five more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to reward your honesty, these five pieces are accepted." Conley laughed. "A few days later." "You can go to work again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But no one wants to ask me, except you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes, please believe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days, when the young people went to apply for a job, a fishery line was very happy to let him come to work the next day. "You have helped Mr. Charles, we have heard, I believe, he will not look away. You are already a person of integrity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many such things, we will not describe them one by one, and Confucius helps people, and always gives them instructions. The way out, not purely using money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good reputation made Constance Charles, at the age of 35, appointed by the authorities as the business consultant secretary in the city, then the tax director, in the fortieth This year, after the retired mayor, he was elected as the new mayor by the city council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chong Lishi is always modest. He is good at mediating disputes between commercial banks. If he encounters disputes about his own industry, he will not be biased. Playing with the authority of the mayor will not make any unfavorable concessions in order to avoid suspicion or seek fame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairness and balance, in this small city dominated by raw material processing, has almost become synonymous with Mr. Conris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guy is a personal, but he can do this, but he deserves it." Even his commercial enemies and competitors are private. I have to admit that no one is better suited to be the mayor than Conley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The richness of the body, the respected status, the excellent character and the loyal and beautiful wife and three lovely children, the life of Conris is undoubtedly Envy and yearning for everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of forty-three, he received a reward from the authorities. At the end of this month, Conley will be given the title of Sir, inheriting the name of the nobleman of Flair. Although the ceremony is still in preparation, the news is well known throughout the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sir Frye." The people who met him took off their hats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, don't, before the completion of the ceremony, I am still Charles, please call me Mr. Charles, Mayor Charles or Charles Factory Director." Answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sundays, Converse always goes to church alone, although he is not a baptized believer, but for decades, he is more than a true believer. To be pious, and occasionally after the mass is over, he will ask to pray in the confession room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chorus of church bells and choirs always filled the whole mass with a mysterious and holy atmosphere. On this Sunday, the mayor of Conris Charles still came to the church as usual, sitting in an inconspicuous corner and praying, waiting for the mass to end, he Going to the back hall, there is a small corridor leading to the confession room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat on the left side of the confession and closed the door. The darkness and silence shrouded the jazz master. After a while, through the mesh wooden window, he listened. Go to the shrine and walk into the cubicle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The lost lamb, please repent." The god said, "Only anything you say, only you, I know the kingdom."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very young voice, you are not a Bishop of Griffiths? He is usually listening to my prayers," asked Confucius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bishop has something to do, let me replace him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the confession room, you are praying for the omniscient heaven, not to me, nor to the bishop."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repentance lasted for a quarter of an hour, and Confucian confession whispered in a narrow room. "How does heaven usually punish sinners?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The kingdom of heaven punishes people with a smile." The new god replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you." Conley whispered, waiting for him to sort out his clothes in the dark, and when he came out, the god of the compartment had left. After another three minutes, Bishop Griffiths came to the confession. He was just entangled in a strange young lady and patiently promoted the half-day church. Doctrine. The bishop looked at the empty room and wondered, "Mr. Mayor did not come to regret this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, what did you hear?" Lauvita asked Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it’s all empty prayers, and I can’t ask specifically, what is worthy of his regrets, it will cause vigilance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
