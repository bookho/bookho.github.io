			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The carriage is on the road, Fran Fryer has been very silent, very few words, heavy curtains isolate all the light, wide compartment Just like a hidden dark room, it is cloudy and foggy, making people lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it, but it was by no means the confusion of the disorder. He tried to control his reason and was calm and cruel. Fran conceived several ways to solve the problem. The obstacles to his path of revenge, there are good ways, no, can not be called good, private revenge has overstepped the moral boundaries, even if wearing a gorgeous false coat, can not hide the inherent gloom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also more evil ways. He found that the more sinful and sinful, the best to achieve the purpose, not to harm their own interests, in contrast, those slightly dyed The means of good intentions are time-consuming and labor-intensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are happy, they put themselves on the high sacred self by hypnosis, never admit that they are wrong, wrapped tightly The cloak of the name of fairness and innocence; and the sensible and introspective people are sad, they can see their shortcomings and truths, and they are troubled by this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan secretly supported the gang, making a huge smuggling kingdom stand in the dark again. He was wrong, which is no different from personal crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is willing to believe that his wife is as kind as ever, he is wrong, and the environment will change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran has tried hard to stay out of the way, guarding virtues, trying to avoid the ugliness and sin that comes with the road of thorns, he is wrong, because that avoids . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullan suffered and suffered, he was wrong, pure self-blame is just to make his own conscience better, no change to reality, just like The drunkard who is addicted to alcohol, squatting to stop drinking and working hard tomorrow, when the light rises, he still sleeps in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hate gangsters, deliberately not directly involved, only enjoying the benefits of alliances with them. Without getting involved in dirty work, counting gold coins, But deliberately ignore the blood on them, thinking that as long as the water is washed, the light is innocent; I regret the filth on my hands, but just think about it, did not get up and clean up," Fran thought. "I am blinding myself, oh, hypocrisy to the extreme villain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light will never shine, but the haze will surrender to the darker and deeper darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright road has been hanged with the "this road is not available" sign, the gray neutral, vain no value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to heaven or going to hell, this is not a multiple choice question, but a positive sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luovita is a smart woman, she vaguely understands the heart of her man Ideas, along the way. The girl always wants to find some topics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kregan has been running gangs for a long time. Although I have most of the funds, but the most important person, it is his power is stronger. It can only be in an undefeated position, which will drag us into the long-term unproductive mud."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The samurai who restored memory, in Byron, could not rely on the influence of Anno, in the upper class of Byron, as the Earl, you can eat her to death, I It is recommended to falsify the scandal and turn the dispute between you into a mad woman who has been abandoned and squanderfully cursed. The Cardinal Troupe has already gone so far. At that time, several nursing homes in the sanatorium can also control, and she has had contact with Zall Law. Long Qi, now a first-class wanted criminal, no one knows the truth, even if things spread, it will only become a joke, so we only have to guard against the attack of the holy warrior by personal force."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When referring to a nurse, you have to say Lila Berry. The girl and the female assassin of the movie king are unexpectedly similar. I have checked her family history. There should be no blood connection. It can only be said that the creation is lazy, and a face is given. Two people use it, I want to be able to use it. In fact, when I kidnap Riddle, I have already taken the first step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have me kiss?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran smiled and turned his head. His fingers tapped his knees. He looked at the girl's shimmering ashes and said, "Resolve it together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;“ Together?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The troubles are always endless, unpredictable, and these old troubles are handled well before new harassment comes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, let me think again." He fell into thinking again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita sneaked a smack to reveal a lovely sweet expression. "The head used the move to change the subject to circumvent my request." The girl thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilla Berry vowed that he had never seen this handsome man. Under the gaze of the other party as if with a hot gaze, her cheeks were flushed, and she unnaturally turned her eyes slightly. The tremors of the eyelashes and the fingers that were tightly twisted together revealed her inner restraint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the command of the administrative secretary of the Whiteman, the girl has been in the town hotel for more than 20 days, bored, for her, The salary must be taken care of, like this kind of light sitting in the life of a monthly ticket, Li La thinks it is not the right way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can go away, but the sense of responsibility makes Lila still stay. On the one hand, she feels that she should resign in person. On the other hand, she still wants to Look at the loving Matilda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is not clear, there are two gunmen stalking her by her side. If she wants to leave without saying goodbye, she will be caught in the moment she leaves the town. live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abnormal life that only took the money and did not work, finally ended at the end of March, and the cold wind of the winter was also gentle. With vitality and vitality, it has sprouted the growth of things between heaven and earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a commercial partner of Sir David Knight, Van Gloria, you can call me the director of Glady."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Rich and handsome men, there is no good thing, they are frivolous men who like to play with women. Lila thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The medical community of the Portuguese Principality has invented a new technology that is effective in curing brain diseases. Miss Matilda has recently traveled by sea to Portugal. The capital of Sterling County."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." So, her position as a nursing job is over, since I can’t see the little Matida, Then she would not face the nasty Miss Whiteman, and then help the profiteer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a new contract here. My company is officially hiring you as my personal secretary. The specific terms are in the contract. What are you asking for? Put forward for deliberation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary is very rich, and there are proper allowances. In her spare time, she also subscribed to the financial newspapers. The Ravens Bank is a newcomer in Golden Bay. investment company. The innocence is innocent, the strength is strong, and the future is infinite. It is said that the profiteer is one of the small shareholders of this firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect its big boss to be so young and handsome, the light black scorpion and the brownish black hair color, it seems to bring some Eastern blood, so more mysterious and more Charm...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rila Horan was shocked, she found that she was always using positive words such as being handsome and young. To describe the man in front of me, this is not a good phenomenon. Although the girl is like a normal woman, she has a good impression on the handsome man, but she should not be obsessed with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Cinderella’s dream to fall in love with the prince, but Cinderella, a little sensible, will eventually choose the man who is the right person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, fairy tales are not the same as reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should calmly refuse to find a more appropriate job." Lila thought, some kind of intuition made her feel dangerous, this firm. This man. There is also his own inexplicable turmoil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She decided, "Well, sir. Where should I sign the contract?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lauvita stood in the corner of the hotel lobby, staring intently at Lila’s admirable look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the head is in another form, it can attract the big breasts. I really should tell the head. Now his appearance is absolutely fascinating for women. It is a weapon that can completely confuse the heart." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stayed for a while, converges on the real expression and hangs a formulaic smile. Going over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very happy to welcome a new colleague." She said to Lila, "Mr. Gloria and I are about to leave for the Golden Bay area. City, the headquarters of the Ravens Business Bank is located in Haide, and you still have some time to prepare the luggage on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will work hard." Pull carefully and put a copy of the contract in your handbag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I will let you work hard and find that there is no residue left. Lauvita dark village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Fran is about to travel to Hyde City, the important city fees in the Golden Bay are in the same place. Two men are arguing in an office on the fourth floor of the solemn patrol hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Smuggling passengers are the cancer of the Golden Bay. They trample on the law, disrupt the market, and act without fear. For an inbound tax certificate that can bleach black goods, They can make their hands full of good blood!" Inspector Lyme Cox groaned, his mouth full of deep hatred, "a tax bureau chief was murdered a few months ago, because He refused to accept the bribe, and the body was found only a few days ago. Hey, what we saw, a large piece of hard cement!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cement?" Long asked for a tour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The common methods used by gangsters, they seize the enemy, throw them into the iron box, pour the cement, and solidify it into a cruel live coffin. Then throw it into the bottom of the sea, or bury it under the soil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gangs exist everywhere, although I am very sympathetic to the director’s experience, but are you too cautious? The law and order of the Golden Bay has always been very good," Sloan said. "We can't make a murder for a murder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, I don't think this is a separate case. Two years ago, when the damn gangster, Igo Andre, collapsed, I thought that it would completely smuggle the smuggling, but now, there is a lot of evidence. It shows that the smugglers in the Gulf region are not scattered and independent.” Inspector Lime said seriously, “Some smuggled boats are nothing, but a unified smuggling dynasty is terrible. They have their own underground arms. The huge network of relationships and business channels completely treat Feidu as a dumping ground for private goods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean... Dynasty? This word is too exaggerated. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just stating the facts, they are bungee jumping at sea, encountering a small sea police patrol boat, and even dare to take out their weapons. Open fire, if it is a naval battleship, it will be scattered, the bulky big guys can't catch up with the boat, they can escape to the land at any time through the continuous coast." The inspector squatted on the table, "the mysterious organizer The smuggler’s leader, the criminal’s mouth Godfather, you have to find him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inspector Cux, you are crossing the border." Sloan touched his eyebrows and warned. Tao, "Your duty is to maintain the security of the city, not the affairs involved in several departments. Dynasty? The godfather holding the underground world authority?" He exaggeratedly shrugged his shoulders, "Your paranoia again Is it happening? In the judicial world, there are quite a few rumors about you. Well, go out, as far as your opinion is concerned, I will consider it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After closing, Sloan’s overall gaze was gloomy. The inspector named Lyme was a veteran veteran of the patrol hall. Recently there was rumor that the authorities were preparing to promote him to a parade. He did not want to have more The deputy who pulled the hind legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows that smuggling is indeed a tumor in the Gulf, but it is continuously sweeping and cutting this rotten meat? That only means bleeding, turbid blood flow, it will inevitably continue to pick out some good looking red blood, many big people are not willing to see such a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it’s the patrol hall, the Marine Police Department, or the Inland Revenue Department, they are indifferently watching the increasingly rampant illegal smuggling, because at the end of each month, there will be one Strings of quite amazing mathematics appear quietly in the private secret accounts of many authorities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even his middle class bureaucrats can get a four-figure ticket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
