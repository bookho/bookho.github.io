			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.In the depths of the alley opposite the Cereal Square, there is a small shop like the restaurant, the name is also loud, called "whistle", mainly Sell ​​some cooked food that is not delicious but cheap. The boss changed the attic into two narrow rooms. When he had no guests, he slept. If he had a customer, he let out the room and slept in the downstairs hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only two sheep fat candles lit in the short hall of the small shop, but the TOEFL, the window of the guest shop is facing a street light on the corner, the boss always I am happy to think, "With the afterglow of this street lamp, the night can save a lot of light overhead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medida and Zall Law live here. The former secret police cut a halo sausage into two pieces, put the long section into the girl's bowl, swallowed the rest and burned it badly, which made him spend a long time sobbing. under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will come back after a while, this intestine will slowly chew." Zolfa said that he can't wait to visit his former colleagues to see if he can The Imperial City Security Office got an errand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Matilda frowned with a finger on the mashed potatoes in the plate. She just picked up the fish in the bowl and only ate it. There are a lot of potatoes that you don't like to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully licked the girl a few words, put on a hat, took the address and asked the boss carefully after the route, pushed the hotel’s half-length wooden door and went out . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida sees no one pays attention, pulls the skirt up with one hand, pours the mashed potatoes and the chewy sausages on it, stepping on it A dilapidated small staircase climbed into the attic. She wants to throw it out from the second floor window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a candle, the position of the bed, cabinet, table and chair can only be identified by the light from the street through the gap in the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was surprised to smash the big scorpion, floating in two dark green spots in the dimly lit room, Matilda blinking strangely, trying to get green On the outline around the light, it is clear that this is a kitten-like, child with ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mimi...hey..." Mathida learned to scream and explored her fingers. Gently touched the other side's delicate forehead, and quickly retracted. She twisted the indigestion that she hadn't eaten. "Would you like to eat, cat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the "kitten" stretched out his neck, curiously smelled the halo, and rushed to Matida, exclaiming, and Matilda stared at the kitten. Falled to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She felt a wet, licking little tongue with a rough hook, licking and licking on her face and neck, tickle the girl giggling, " Don't make trouble." She patted the other's head, and the kitten ignored it and buried her head in the chest of Matida, seemingly exploring something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia is not a qualified hunter. Her past experience tells herself that prey should scream in horror. Struggling and resisting. But the friendly action and cheerful laughter of this prey made her hesitate. But the doubts only lasted for a few seconds, and the heart beat vigorously in the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sweet temptation of the sacred force and the dragon veins, almost the little orcs who are hungry are losing their senses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really fragrant." Cecilia even reluctant to eat it like this, she looked up and kissed Ma Dida's red lips. The green mans in the eyes are full of scent, with a strange and strange atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a ripple in the void, and the small room seemed to be closed by an invisible barrier. Light and darkness, temperature and sound seemed to solidify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Ann Corleone’s “Crimson Prosecutor”, Cecilia’s dragon vein “Nepenthes” is not strong enough to confuse the law. But it is more than enough to hang on to prey. In the scope of her dragon veins, energy in any person's body will be forcibly removed and turned into nourishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Matidda’s hair was set up, and she put the kitten in front of her face with the uncomfortable gaze on the road. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale sacred fireworks are called, like a chain. Bound the enemy's limbs, but it didn't work at all. The chain of fire quickly collapsed, dissolved, and became a bleak spot, quickly plunging into Cecilia's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not enough." She licked her lips and explored the body of her prey with her fingers. Every time I touched it, the white and tender skin was like The withered petals began to eclipse, and the violent pain made Madida yell, only feeling that the body was getting colder and colder, and every effort spurted out of the muscle blood marrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blush on the face made the young little orc girl seem to have a high fever, and she trembled because of the intense pleasure in eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida weakly hands, wants to push the other person away from the body, the breath of pain and death makes the feeling of despair look like boundless darkness, sweeping away . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"恍铛", like the sound of glass bursting, Matilda felt that something in the body broke open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Law: Shelter." Her mind flashed a wonderful symbol, her blue lips consciously whispered, pale yellow light Extending from the body to the outside, forcibly sitting on her, and Cecilia bounced openly and gasping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The heresy!" Matilda is like a marionette, and the joints are slowly getting up and stiff, and they are blind. "At the trial of heaven, it is filthy." Dirty and reading, all have to be annihilated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dazzling white flame rekindles, like the tide of the reef, rolling one after another, Colliding with the barrier under the "Nepenthes" cloth, Cecilia felt that her feet were shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sea of ​​fire, there is a rush of shackles, and countless flames are swaying, forming a purely energy-filled space in the virtual space. The flame weapon, the flame on the sword, is like a ray of light, reflecting the low-lying small rooms like the sacred and solemn mass chamber. She held the handle and lifted the giant sword. The pressure brought by the sacred fire on the sword allowed Cecilia to instinctively step back two steps and stick it to the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The heresy, please repent!" Matilda's voice seemed to drift from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc girl looked at the sword of the flame fascinatedly, and touched the lower abdomen. "If you can't eat it, your stomach will swell." She swallowed her mouth. Like a little fox who knows that it is an extreme threat in front of him, but he is reluctant to trap the chicken in the trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, or to escape first, anyway, already full." Cecilia turned her eyes and thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment she took back the pitcher plant and jumped out of the window, the house that lost support was suddenly collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zall Law Lonchi walked briskly from the street, and his colleague promised to recommend himself to the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is a small undercover, it is much stronger than the current dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he returned to the hotel, he looked at a crowd of crowds of people watching and crying, and shouting at the hotel owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the giant bear, the hotel in the alley, the roof was overturned, the tender wooden wall. There were only a few pieces of wood left behind, and the foundation of the whole building was hardened by a few points from the land, and it was slanting and lingering, and it was far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really don't know what happened!" The boss excitedly said to the patrolman who came to investigate, "Suddenly the house swayed, I thought the earthquake "That's what it is."<br /><br />&nbsp; The boss shook his head. The sound of fighting on his head was concealed by Cecilia's ability barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrolman carefully looked at the collapsed house. This building, which has been in existence for decades, has not been properly maintained. He wrote down the opinion on the book and thought it was a collapse of a dangerous house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about her? Ma Dida?" Drowl squeezed the crowd, rushed over, and yelled at the boss’s collar, even if the scorpion could Hearing, he was anxious in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss only remembered that there were people in the room. His face was immediately white and scary. "In there... there is a girl..." He looked at the patrol in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait for the rescue team." The patrolman looked at the house that said it would not collapse immediately. Some guilty. The words have not been finished yet. Zall law rushed in. Bypassing the collapsed low wall, in the cracks of the gravel bricks, he saw the beams broken into several sections and the bricks scattered all over the floor. Not touching the girl's body at all, but like being blocked by only the invisible hand, centered on Matida, forming a bizarre vacant land of nearly three yards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hugged her knees in her hands, sat quietly on the ground, and raised her head in amazement, looking up at the vast night sky from the huge crack in the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sly star, flashing, is on the lookout. Apply a touch of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruins, girls, stars, as if a delicate picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's okay." Zall was sweating and wanted to take the girl out of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I seem to remember some pictures...collapsed underground waterway...fighting..." Matida turned her face to him, but Zall Law felt The girl does not look to herself, but looks at the void in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that something is vital, I haven't done it yet." Matida whispered dryly, "What the hell is it? Let me repeat Think about it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you going? Gray, not afraid to get lost." Captain Baru met Cecilia in the corridor. Frowning, kneeling down, slap the mud on the skirt, and rub the dirt on her face with her fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The then head of the doubts was frustrated by Fran, who came over. "Where did you get a dog?" She looked behind the man, that A big dog with a tongue and a warm eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Picking." Fran said, handing the pastry box in his hand to Cecilia, "a small snack for you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia shook her head. "I can't eat, full."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you eat "What?" Fran looked at the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Barrie smiled sweetly, took it, took out a piece and stuffed it into her mouth. "It tastes good." She kept admiring The bright expression on his face is like a blooming flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's like it, buy another box next time." Fran is strange, that ordinary ordinary pastry house, the craft will be so outstanding? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, many people can't sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Fryer turns off the light, leans on the bed, ignites the smoke, gently spits and smothers the smoke, in the dark, thinking that no one can Understand the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
