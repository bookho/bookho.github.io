			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning sun reveals a dark blue sky from the gap between the leaves. The small jungle after the rain contains refreshing freshness and the water droplets are still wide. The leaves flowed back and forth, and Fran stepped on the last temperature of the bonfire, "starting," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road is very slippery, the horseshoe splashes from time to time to fly mud, the morning after the rain is generally foggy, the distant forest, the end of the extended road, are wrapped in light smoke In the air, perhaps the bells coming from distant villages, slightly awakened the sleeping wilderness, the birds singing, I don’t know where the source is, so that the lonely morning will soon be full of vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...sleep in the dust, wake up and sing." The samurai girl read the morning prayer, her mount is more than the southwestern A hundred times, but only under the guidance of the master, helplessly follow the old horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiaguang retreats, a touch of cloud occupies the sky, four hours later, a salt field and quite prosperous villages appear in the field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s coming soon." Fran shouted. "When you get to the place, everything is listening to me. Even if you have more questions, don't say it. It is the rule."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I will play some drama, Those people can't deal with them badly. If you are embarrassed, please be patient, otherwise you will not be able to buy information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A raw face, it is difficult to get the trust of smugglers." Fran thought, "With this girl, I can change a more direct way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After fighting with the imaginary imaginary who is trying to become a god, the holy warrior who can survive will not be a mediocrity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the very close, but the road to the seven bends allowed them to run for another hour before they came to Sara. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the small pier, all the flat shoals near the sea were dug into the drying ground, and the sea was smashed in one of the evaporation ponds, waiting for them to be The sunlight evaporated and only the shallow turbid water was left, and then another pool was guided to form a large chunk of coarse salt, a gray curtain and a white salty salt, as if it were thick on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salt trucks are parked in front of a home shop, but more vehicles, gathered in the docks, tax-free foreign tobacco, wool, and even stained glass, are much cheaper than regular channels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship of private transport is small, not much can be transported at a time, often through the inside line, the buyer has already been fixed, so the goods are loaded onto the car in order, all transactions, They are all done without words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smugglers at the dock, looking at the strangers, there are several people with obvious weapons hidden in their waists, not far behind them, "No. Like a spy, it seems that he does not know the market and misunderstands the recent nobles and young ladies." They thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sara can't be a rogue, in fact, its law and order is better than every remote town, and there is a coexistence agreement between smugglers, Tianda The contradictions have to be settled at sea, and the aborigines, those who rely on selling salt and providing protection for smuggling boats in exchange for money, do not want bloodshed to attract the attention of the guards in nearby cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all know that a good atmosphere can make better money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only hotel and bar in the town is in the city center. Fran and Matida tied the horse to the stables and just walked in and attracted all the attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people sitting in the corner should be the merchants who have not yet shipped the goods, and the sailors who have just completed the task, drinking ale, curiously watching , whispering from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare lunch for me and this lady," Fran threw a gold coin on the counter and whispered, "And, inform the old Maid. Jess, the old patron is coming. If he is not there, tell me when he can come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assassin Master Maidjes, once in Sarah The town stayed for a while, and this information was recorded in the archives of the patrol hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metida is a bit strange, Toboso's fluent Byron has more obvious foreign accents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are fried fish and mashed potatoes for lunch." The buddy in the counter shouted loudly toward the kitchen. "Come two." See no one pays attention again. Reply, "Sir, this shop is not called the buddy of Madges."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He helped me and told this contact point." Fran patted the clerk's hand and secretly stuffed a gold coin. "Less, or call your head, there are sales."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, so good, I turned to the patrol team of Feidu to help. Ask." Fran threatened with a sinister tone. "I have a little problem to solve in private. Since you don't want to, see you later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, Please ask the two to go to the 2nd floor to eat." The man said in a strange tone, he decided to let the head solve the trouble, or talk about the business, or the wilderness outside the town of Sarah is more than a murder case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire 2nd floor is empty, with only a small hall and a set of tables and chairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fried fish is very salty, Matida frowned, drank a few mouthfuls of water before swallowing it, Fran leaned on the chair and rubbed his fingers Mashed potatoes, "Is it hard to eat?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, I have eaten worse than this craft." Matilda said, "Food is the gift of the Father and cannot be abandoned at will." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of his beliefs or his own character, Fran has a slight affection for this girl, she is obviously a good family-born lady, it is difficult to see This kind of high society will be picky and prudent as a woman who can eat hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a quarter of an hour, a sound came from the stairs, a dark-skinned middle-aged man, with two followers, walked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White-faced kid, what help?" The man sat down on the bench and asked vulgarly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking for Madges, who are you?" Fran elegantly wiped his fingers with a towel. "Please respect, otherwise I will marry you." The ass, just like at home, licking slaves who don’t have long eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, guys, have you heard? Someone wants to lick my ass The man laughed. "How do we usually do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take off the clothes and throw them into the sea." The followers smiled and walked over, "but the head This beautiful lady, maybe we can be gentle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Baby." Fran frivolously pilgrims said, "My clothes, only you can take off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mattida squats, his face appears Blush, looking at Fran with annoyance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to listen to me." He speaks with a pun, reminds Ma Tida, according to prior agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand clinging to the girl’s shoulder, for a moment, he was thrown out, “Law: fix.” The girl shouted, wood The vine-like twisted white light waves on the floor, all men, including Fran, were tied in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;François They are still in amazement, staring at Matida, "Quickly let me loose," he hinted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, this girl is a samurai!" the man said, "Mr. what do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this attitude, mutual respect, is good for everyone." Fran shrugged his shoulders. "As I can now lick your ass, but I don't do it, baby, solution. Open the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida hesitated to do so, she stood beside Fran and felt that the place she had just touched had a layer Goose bumps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene is in the eyes of others, like a very loyal maid and lover, protecting her master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can make a holy warrior a waiter, how is this guy's illustrious identity." The smuggler's leader thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullan mentions the small suitcase, unlocks the lock, throws it on the table, and draws a new banknote inside, which makes people unable to take their eyes off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mide Jess, who entrusted him with the task five years ago, perfected for me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has died long ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course he knew he was dead. Fran thought, the death of the old assassin and the trial of Igo Andech, he had personally participated in part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
