After confirming the cumbersome secrets, they were busy and unloaded dozens of boxes of small containers tied up by ropes. Going to the shore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headed man cuts the tightly tied rope, throws away the moisture-proof canvas for the outer layer of waterproofing, opens the box, and places it on the white foam. Many black baubles with handles. He took out a delicate revolver and buckled it a few times, feeling the crispness between the trigger and the wall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;铿锵, nodded with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line is elegant, the fire-fighting long-handled shotgun, the military uniforms that circulate to the outside world, single-shot shotguns, and any model. Smuggling arms is undoubtedly the most profitable business. While earning a lot of money, you can better arm yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the main reason why Kregen has developed rapidly in the Golden Bay. When other small gangs still hold a few bullets made of iron sand, toy-like thin iron manual At the time of the gun, the direct guard of the giant boxing has long been armed with a full range of more precise and more precise targets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark battle to seize the site, the gang’s gunmen are as old as the Byron army on the Black World, conquering the monks with powerful civilized weapons. Savage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can even get explosives, these governments are strictly controlled, and they are not allowed to sneak into the hands of private individuals, even if they are retracted to guard The shell-like stronghold does not help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the container was lifted onto the carriage, another group of people appeared on the outskirts of the tidal flat, gray uniforms and polished badges highlighting their identity . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are the patrol hall of Feidu, suspecting that you have committed wrongdoing. Now, lay down your arms and hold your hands in your hands..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshots interrupted the police’s orders. For a time, the interlaced bullets covered the narrow, narrow beaches, letting each other bleed and take away the temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The firepower of smugglers is even more fierce than the police. A shotgun shoots out deadly ammunition, hides the enemy from the rocks behind it, hits countless splashes of gravel, and a piece of gravel flies into a certain The patrolman who is in a hurry to avoid it.狠狠 dig out the eye. And want to cover him, ready to pull him into the safe section of the same, but also fell into a pool of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smugglers rushed back and slammed into a single barge. When everything was calm, only a few bodies and smuggled goods that could not be taken away were left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspector Lem Kukes came out from behind the rock. He wiped his dusty face and spit on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Invent the seized stolen goods and send the injured person to the nearest hospital." The inspector told him that he was frustrated to see the escaped line on the Haiping line. Very far from the boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Think of a full-scale blow. It requires the precise coordination of the Mounted Police and the Marine Patrol Ship.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; But these departments will only shirk responsibility, I am weak." The old inspector smashed a punch on the rock wall, and the flesh and blood are blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hundreds of thousands! Laozi lost a value of more than 100,000 goods!" Krigan was indignant. It seems that I have suffered a lot of grievances. "There are enough tickets for several manors to be bought every month, and they are given to those who are official, but this time the police raided, no one came to inform me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gang’s little heads looked down in fear, no one dared to speak out, and in this case they broke the old mold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't care about that little money, but the key thing is that I smelled a different wind direction than before. If the authorities intended it, we must temporarily avoid the wind." Head; if it’s an unopened guy trying to do it right with me, give it a bit of color.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I checked, it’s the patrol hall After the intelligence acquisition, the private action did not notify any relevant departments beforehand." A small head replied slyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The patrol hall? The list of gambling squads can have the name of Sloan's general patrol. Why didn't he show a little wind?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lim Cux, the inspector who is responsible for the serious case, seems to be targeting our gang recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Kregan pinched his fist, and there was a loud noise from the bones. He was stunned and just wanted to say something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, something big!" Little Bies got to Kriegen and whispered a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan looked awkward, and the ugly ugly face showed a trace of tension and uneasiness. He waved the other to let go, then lowered the voice and anxiously asked, "That How many people did the guy bring? Where is the whereabouts now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A total of ten people, including six armed gunmen and three women, Lauvita White Mayn’s little fox is also among them.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ten people? With this man, he dared to come back? You didn’t make a mistake.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Verified verification, yes, but we can't move him on the bright side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guy was not as imaginative, hiding in a country market town, but swaying and talking about the Hyderabad Hotel , the boss, that area, but the rich people in the city The place, even the Haide City officials who took the most bribes, will not allow the gang’s forces and struggles to invade the rich areas, even if we only fired a shot there and did a case, then, The entire bureaucratic class in Hyde will be desperately trying to pinch us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every place has their own unique rules, who in the west, whose fists are hard It’s a big fight. In the Golden Bay, you have to learn to respect wealth. Otherwise, it will be crowded hostile by all those who hold various rights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Flair walked out of the hotel lobby, two bodyguards accompanied, four stayed behind, Cecilia shivered in the room, Lila Berry is nervously practicing the techniques of organizing documents. In front of the door, he pulled the ruffled wide cap down, so that the shadow under the cap just covered the deep eyelids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich man’s team was always very attractive. The corner of the street parked a caravan with gray curtains. The two strong men in the car exchanged their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage drove around the rich area for a few laps and stopped. Fran and Lauvita walked into a beautifully decorated facade, and the bodyguards remained in the car in the street parking lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stalker sorted out the hairstyle and clothes and followed them in, but was blocked by the receptionist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr., please show the admission ticket."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Admission volume?噢, just Just look at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This salon does not accept foreign guests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, I bought two tickets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, sold out a few days ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But..." The stalker wants to move on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three security guards with hard plastic sticks on their waists came over, "Need help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "These two gentlemen did not make an appointment and purchase tickets, but insisted..." The receptionist's feelings of boredom were overwhelming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, nothing, let's go right away." The stalker had to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most expensive club in Hyde City is hosting a fashion show, and the trackers seem to be interested in the costumes and stayed for an entire hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salon's room was filled with soothing accompaniment music, and the beautiful models walked up and down the stage bridge with cute steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All fashions are made by famous designers who represent the most popular fashions in the Golden Bay area in the next quarter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think I wear in a crepe evening dress with a small shoulder?" Lauvita glared at the scorpion. "There are two people adorned along the way." We."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The clothes on the chest are too big." Fran answered. "It doesn't matter, let them follow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The owner likes to be conservative, or dislike me ** Not rich enough?" Lauvita wrinkled a small nose. "Not a patrolman, not a well-trained training, a gang member."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not call my master, Moreover, size is not the only criterion for measuring the chest.” Fran picked his brow. “The police in Hyde are quite slow. I haven’t noticed it until now, and there are a lot of valuable stolen goods in front of the public.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I say strong and feel, I am very confident." Lauvita is interested in gazing at the colorful pullover of a new model, "add some flavor to the seasoning, Screaming them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's watch for two more days." Fran thought of something. He turned to look at the girl. "We have to talk so awkwardly. Yes, continue with the boring topics of those just now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is "Love." Lauvita smiled. "Life is a cake, and the taste is the grass with the above ornamentation. These are essential."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;福Lan feels that she and the gray-eyed girl are quite a bit old-fashioned wife. In the conspiracy tricks, they are skilled partners; in daily life, they are intimate; even when doing some kind of calorie-consuming sweating exercise, they can take care of each other's feelings and enjoy together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since he resurrected and began to take the road to revenge, he knows the woman closest to him, only Lavetta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a matter of ignorance? Or want to escape something that is unforgettable and unwilling to face up?" Fran’s mind suddenly flashed a kitten-like beauty. Face, he called the unspeakable name in his heart and suddenly stayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of morality that is reserved, let Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a wife. Although the woman who once had a slap in the face, like him, has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, what?" Lauvita’s call made Fran come back, and he realized that the lights were already bright and the fashion show had just ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
