			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you hook up on the head?" The girl was like an insect, swaying in front of Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Nicole, please don't let Barrie be embarrassed." Fran was hard to get rid of, fortunately, the clothes made by canvas for canvassing were fairly solid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I will not be embarrassed to the head of the team, so I will come to you now." Nicole licked her nose, and there was a red mark on the straight nose. She just hid. Eavesdropping outside the door, I thought I could hear the violent vibration and the joyful sigh, but in two minutes, the door suddenly opened, and her tears came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Paris is in good condition now? Do you have a doctor?" Fran asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Still in low fever, the doctor said that he should release blood to lower his body temperature." Nicole said angrily. "It took two caesars, but the quack will only bleed." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the pastor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This small place, where will know The priest of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go and see her first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pali Si is too pitiful, her body has always been bad." Nicole said sympathetically, half-sounding, she suddenly screamed, "Casimodo, big man, you actually opened the topic. Too embarrassed."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireplace in the room of Paris is burning, the girl is closed, and she is still in a half-awake state, flushed with her face, braving sweat, and Fulan’s cold hand Put it on her forehead, make the girl feel very comfortable, unconsciously turn his head with the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take her out of the arm of the quilt, Fran wants to put it back in the quilt, but he found something strange, holding Parry Si's hand was carefully observed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Fran’s head was knocked down by a hard object, and Nicole squinted and held the long wooden strip for the shackle. Just took advantage of the head of the group, and came to account for Paris."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go buy some pepper and green onions, the green onion hotel should have, pepper to the town Shop to buy.” Fran told, “Remember that it is black pepper.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Are you hungry?" Nicole is thinking about whether to come again. "When you are hungry, you go to the hall to eat, pepper? This condiment is expensive, you are really willing."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it's helpful to use a pepper, green onion and broth to help the fever." Fran threw the captain's caesar to Nicole, and the girl dropped the door bolt and picked it up. After paying the money, the result was the sound of the wood lying on the ground, which made Paris complain in pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole grabbed Paris’s arm from Fran, stuffed it back, carefully closed the edge of the quilt, and then she launched Fran The room said, "Before I come back, you will be honest in the lobby on the first floor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can eliminate your suspiciousness, I am willing." Fran Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a good girl." Fran looked at Nicole’s back. Then he considered the strange phenomenon he had just seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, you can see which class this person belongs to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the head of Baru, Nicole, the palm of the hand can see a thin layer of sputum, the skin is slightly rough. This is a mark of poor family origins. From an early age, they have to help the family to do some heavy work. Even if they are now troupe actors, the legacy of the old man has not yet fallen off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the palm of the hand is very delicate, there is no trace of labor, which usually only appears in the family members of the rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She joined the troupe two years earlier than Fran, and has always played the role of a heroine maid. In the troupe, Paris is the youngest, probably only fifteen years old. It is a younger sister who is taken care of and rarely does rough work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She, is there a good birth? But fell to the tour theater company?" Fran guessed, but the clues were still too few, and the head of the team was very strict. Unless the girl is willing to say it, there is no way to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, Nicole came back and saw her sweaty appearance, apparently running. "A Caesar, I bought it." Point." She took a small parchment bag from her pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough." Fran smashed the peppers with his fingers, poured them into the bowl, borrowed the kitchen from the hotel, and got some ginger. shallot. “Unfortunately, without basil or basil, these oriental plants are more effective for fever.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bowl of black screaming, smelling spicy, and mixed with strange scented soup will soon be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Paris drinks this strange thing, it doesn't improve, but the condition worsens, I won't let you go."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest assured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole group enjoyed the fried eggs for breakfast, Paris burned back, and the body was a little weak, but he could go downstairs to have breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the revamped Baru apparently did not remember what happened yesterday. She frowned and looked at the clothes on Fran. "It’s too unconformable. A lot of places have been torn, you won’t be running and playing with the bear.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie can bear to laugh, consider for a long time, decide not Tell the bear who told the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barui has regained the essence of careful calculation, she announced to Fran, "In the future, you will play the leading role."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie was almost killed by the eggs contained in his mouth. Sometimes, too much humor is also a kind of torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone listens to me." The head of the team persuaded, "Enna, who has been playing the male role, has gone, the troupe is seriously not enough, Nicole has to play the female horn." Palis is not tall enough. Only Quasimodo can play this role until we can find a more suitable one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the appearance of the big man... This kind of prince is still a knight, certainly not popular." Nicole retorted, "The audience did not have a sense of substitution, YY is not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will think A good script to make up for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is very pleased that the head has regained his fighting spirit. "So, can the Cardinals continue to do so?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, it’s a pity to give up the ideal with a little setback." Barry rubbed the egg yolk with the finger on the corner of the mouth, then put it on the lips, using the tongue Hey, this tired and lazy with a vulgar movement, she is very charming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
