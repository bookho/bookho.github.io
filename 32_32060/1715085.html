			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. In the Golden Horn Bay, wealth can not exceed the rules of the law, but it can also counter its authority to a certain extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich people can hire a group of barristers to defend him in court. Under the magic of banknotes, many of the original ironclad certificates will magically For the rottenness that cannot be scrutinized, all of these mysteries are well known, so when it comes to the case of rich or public figures, the patrol hall will be extra cautious, they will scatter the net until they feel the fish in the net is heavy, they will gather. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Haide police station complained, "Feidu patrol hall has caused us trouble again." But they still sent plain clothes spies, they hold legal licenses. , secretly searched the suspect's room in the White House Hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the point of view of some documents in the room, the suspect is a Portuguese and has a large number of industries and companies in the country." The spy wrote in the report, " We noticed that the signatures of the two copies of the document were the same, but one was signed by Fryes and the other was Braque, indicating that the suspect had the habit of using a pseudonym, but the content of the document was not doubtful. Recently, a new account was opened in the bank. The specific amount of the bank refused to disclose it, but from the personal reception of the president, it is a big number."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A huge amount of Portuguese riches?" Inspector Lyme thought about it. He pushed the other side may be a foreign smuggling head and came to the Gulf to talk about big deals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff of the patrol hall of Feidu immediately set off and signaled that the police in Haid should not act rashly in order to check it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Frye generously gave the agent a lengthy time to collect evidence. He deliberately led everyone and rented two for the seaside outside the city. Big yacht, fishing and swimming in the deep sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spy of the police station thinks this is suspicious, and the smugglers and the sea are always inseparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they informed the support of the maritime patrol, they dressed up as another group of tourists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dock, a young girl with a beautiful gray face came over to them, although the spies knew that the other was one of the suspects. But still can't help but look at the girl's two slender and lovely legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you locals?” said the girl. “My host came to Haide for the first time. I don’t know the distribution and islands of the nearby reefs. I want to find a guide.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"We are also tourists." The spy said in a dialect with nothing to say, "The Dock Management Office can provide guidance and only need one silver coin per hour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dock Management Office was immediately under control. After a quarter of an hour, a plainclothes policeman was a tour guide. Boarded the yacht of the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the boat was opened, the guide sent a message, "They are going to go fishing in Warm Water Bay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The smuggling vessels of at least five maritime patrols, with lifebuoys and canvases, cover the police station’s sign and arrive at the destination in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenshuiwan is a flat and wide harbor, with land on three sides facing the sea, with a large bell-like mouth facing the sea, and the cliffs on the shores of the hills block the wind. Let the nearby sea water warm a few degrees. Spring is a good season for fun. Many leisure people come here to ride the yacht to shine. Seagulls nest on the cliffs. In the Scorpio hovering, the boat cut through the sea and stirred up the foamy water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful white bird is used to the leftovers left by tourists, and the tail is screaming with the yacht. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many colorful sun umbrellas in the golden sand of the beach, men and women in swimwear and beach pants, either playing in shallow water or lying on a folding chair. Close your eyes and raise your spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tour guide did not see the abnormality. The target pedestrian was like the most qualified tourist. The boat cast cobalt on the surface of the water 200 meters from the coast, gray eyes The girl put on a yellow two-piece swimsuit and drove down the soft rope ladder on the side of the deck. In the blue sea, it was like an elegant mermaid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran wearing a sunhat. Taking a pipe and fishing quietly, the girl swims around to disturb the water and scares away the fish that are ready to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, do you want me to get nothing?" he cried. "If the water is cold, hurry up."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The water here is moderate and safe." The girl sneaked into the bottom of the water and quickly floated up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that there are many treasures sleeping on the bottom of the sea. If I am lucky, I might be able to pick a box."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those ethereal things are too unrealistic if you I want to order beautiful gadgets. I will buy you a set in a few days, which is very valuable and has a long history."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ship from Osage, both eyes, can travel a hundred nautical miles a day, and waited for the Customs of the Holy Cross to be transported to the Golden Horn Bay. When you pick it up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plainclothes police came over a box of fish food and sprinkled the bait into the water to attract the fish. He silently remembered the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s all police." Kregan’s men had already chased him, and a whole team of people was full of firepower, which could cause a massacre. They quickly noticed that some of the yachts were not right. Although they were disguised and the laymen could not see them, these standard styles were officially smuggled and they had been chasing them many times at sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is an ambush, cancel the action." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An expedited letterhead with a red seal was sent to the Holy Cross Customs by the fastest postal ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every ship from Russia, especially the speedboat, was carefully cleaned up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have legal entry orders and tax receipts, and the entire warehouse is full of wool." The owner of a cargo ship was palely protesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Customs and Excise Department found only ten boxes of wool on the top of the ship in the ship's warehouse. The rest were all illegal stolen goods: gold and silver jewelry, will enter the underground The auction of oil paintings and sculptures has a total value of 400,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gulf News Times published this news in a red headline, saying: Feidu patrol hall combined with Haide Police Station, Tax Bureau, perfect value This major private case was broken, and the illegal smuggled goods seized included even several famous paintings stolen from the Russian Museum, and the Portuguese-based Byron Embassy dispatched a commissioner to publicly express praise and gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detectives in the murder department were treated with heroic treatment, but the inspector Lyme said to them, "The boys are not over yet. If the suspects are not inadvertently exposed, we will not find any clues. I What is needed is annihilation! Thoroughly annihilating this smuggling group!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The suspect should know a lot about the inside story, getting news from his mouth can make us do more with less. Captain, apply for an arrest warrant! "But the patrol officer's legal adviser dissuaded, "What reason?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Undercover agents can appear in court to testify, The suspect said to the lover that a certain amount of valuable goods departed from Osage and entered through the Customs of the Holy Cross. She was then selected by her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we I can't prove that the smuggling boat is in the discourse. Believe me, wait for the court, the suspect's lawyer can find out more than a dozen Russian-style books in the Customs of the Holy Cross, just fill in the various Merchant ship of goods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspector Lyme silenced the film First, "There is nothing wrong with this. The evidence cannot accuse him of being involved in smuggling. He will continue to monitor all his whereabouts." The inspector said sternly, "The police station and the local police station in Hyde will form a special investigation. The team, cooperate with each other. I want to know every word that the suspect said!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Russia - Holy Cross Customs - Feidu this route I used to be responsible, so I know what will be shipped recently.” Lauvita said, “But the others are controlled by Kregan. I can’t provide detailed information anymore.” “It’s enough.” Fran The answer, "The police fully believe that I am the leader of the foreign smuggling group. They have no evidence to arrest and sue me. They can only stare closely, and I, unintentionally, confide in every word, they will be sure." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The main person in charge of the authorities is the inspector of Lem Kukes of the patrol hall of the Federal Capital."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Lyme?" Fran smiled in nostalgia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the police’s forces officially intervened, Fran’s two men had already secretly left the city with the new secretary Lila Berry, and went to Feidu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
