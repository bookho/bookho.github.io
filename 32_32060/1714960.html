			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walked in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yang or shadow accompany her extension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large purple-black robes wrap her petite body up and down tightly, and a few faint blond hairs are scattered in the ears, on the correct face, slightly on Around the nose, you can see the fragile freckles, and the box in the armpit is wrapped in a black cloth. She squinted and smiled, but from the scorpion, she kept swaying, like a misty green awn, alerting the holy warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon Maiden?" Matilda gathered the flame at his feet, "Devil's accomplice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I don't know him." The girl walked forward arbitrarily, through the woodland full of rot leaves and dead branches, kicking Fulan with her feet. "You are reading and taking the sword and painting. I didn't do it, I was going to sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picked up Fran’s body on the ground with his toes, let him lie on his back, and then was surprised Covering his mouth, "A ugly man." She bent over and squeezed Fran's face with her fingers. Some confused said, "Weird, his voice just sounded familiar."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longmai suddenly frowned, showing a painful expression. "No, that voice, I should have never heard it, what happened? Why is there a familiar feeling?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida looked at the girl who suddenly popped up, like a madman, kept talking to herself, the holy warrior raised his hand, and the flame immediately became pure White Whip, to take away the Dragon's side of the trunk space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warn only once, leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flame whip, even the hardest steel, I can't resist it, but this time, it didn't even touch the ground. In the air, it was like a snake. It was covered by seven inches of invisible hand. It was desperately twisted and struggling. Pure white turned into blush and changed. It was dim, then, with black smoke, dissipated in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is he?" The Dragon Veins did not care about the attack just now. She looked up and asked in the tone of the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida did not answer, maintaining a ready posture for the generation, the flames of the captain, entwined in the sword, the sword of the knight sword, blink of an eye When it is melted, the molten steel is too late to drip, it is evaporated, and the flame tongue spreads a long blade on the hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fire at the foot, along with the mind, four downstream movements, around the body of Ma Tida, instead of pen and ink and magical media, depicting a complex array of laws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t you say?” The Dragon Maid stood up, dropped the box, and the box rolled on the ground, just by a holy flame, black cloth and gold rim The luxurious wooden box, and the things stored in the box, can only be heard and slammed, and there is no trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Madida still got it, the box is a bloody head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The heresy of the heresy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I can't make a difference now." The Dragon Maier said, "How do you punish you? Just, I hate the holy warrior. I remember one time, it is the holy warrior, making the chickens fly in the city, and even the price of the food is rising..." Her face The stern expression was replaced by a doubt. "City? Vegetable price? Why do I say this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheng Flame Sword, smash it, in the void In the middle, the trajectory of the Ambilight, the array of the ground, the symbols of the flames, the glare of the white light, and the radiance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still only cut in half, the blade of the fire, dissipated a few yards from the other’s head, and Matilda’s wrist was caught by the dragons. And a slender, black-eyed finger, silent, like a thin paper, pierced the flame of her defense, a blood hole, appearing slightly away from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is a real sword, it will be effective for me." Longmai said faintly, "Dragon vein plus magic, it is quite powerful, but unfortunately, then the mouse It is impossible to defeat cats, natural enemies and classes, and it is always a gap that you cannot overcome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is holding Ma Tida, the tone is like a big sister is teaching The younger sister who is not sensible, but it is not a fight to beat the ass. It can be twisted hard. Matilda’s arm makes a few horrible sounds, and the arm bones are almost broken into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida feels that the body is tied up with a rope, and like walking in the mud, every time he does an action, it is slow and laborious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sees that within the range of five yards around her, it seems to be shrouded in a deep black, compared to the farther, moonlight Deep into the abyss, the light can never shine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
