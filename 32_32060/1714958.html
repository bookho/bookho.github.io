			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following attention does not meet my plan. Fran thought that he didn't expect to be welcome. In the three-day performance, the troupe's tent was filled with people every day. People loved to watch his performances. It was not a kind of burlesque, but liked to see. Hear, a ugly sorrowful tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in the troupe is like living in a dream, the only thing that is done, Nicole is staring at Fran, and then saying, "It’s weird, is it? Has the human aesthetic changed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, a miracle was born in reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinals play three games a day, sometimes for another one. On the fourth day, they even played five games, and the smoke bombs at the end of the link No need, Dawn Fort has accepted the appearance of Fran, every time the curtain call, the audience stood up, cheers so that the shelves of the big tent are shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wilderness and the riverside outside the town, there are tall white birch and yellowish flowers, but these days, the flowers are pulled out, those The petals were thrown in the tents, so that when they received the work every day, they had to hire a few temporary workers to clean the ground like a petal blanket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barui complained that every day, the odds and pieces of the ticket, let her count the fingers cramps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale of the troupe’s scale is always on her lips, and another competition, but the bleak little circus, has begun to contact and see if it can be merged. Of course, when it is divided, the cardinals have a big head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the eve of the end of the market, a young man came to a gilded rose, his face was white, his hair was neatly combed, his clothes were old, but he looked decent, that a middle-lower class person who has received a good education but has no surplus property. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a playwright." He opened the door and said to the head of the board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, sir, we can't afford a playwright like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "In the past few days, the Cardinals Theatre has been a sensation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, our Quasimodo, played awesome." Barry was proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long does this momentum last?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head is a little upset, "Sir, the prophet of the crow's mouth, but it will be burned to death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. This is the truth." The man carefully analyzed, "After six days The Guilds are all playing the same drama. Although the adaptation is good, the greatest merit is the benefit of the original work. A successful troupe can't lack its original script."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please go on." The head has a little interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People join in your drama because of novelty, from the birth of the drama, there has never been a ugly person, who can act as a star, and those people, Generally speaking, it can only be used as a funny embellishment in the play. The appearance of Casimodo satisfies the psychology of the audience. They can appreciate the plot with a sense of superiority. 'Oh, even he can save the princess and fight against the darkness. I should also be able to 'satisfy the audience's superiority to better satisfy their imagination, cheer for Mr. Quasimodo, and cheer for the dream of the little man eager to make a miracle."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you mean that Casimodo is not doing well?" Barry was annoyed. If it was not a hotel but a cardinal camp, she had already driven the crow’s mouth out. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." The crow mouth continued. "He has not received professional training. The performance skills are actually very naive. But this is not the main problem." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People have a herd mentality, when each When the city can cheer for Quasimodo, then, appearance, acting is not a problem, a star respected by everyone, even if it is made on the stage, will be considered by the admirers to be a personal style, then, the cardinals will be Performing at the Grand Theatre in the Metropolis, not in the countryside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously "to perform at the Metropolitan Grand Theatre" impressed Barry, she Ask with concern, “What do we do, according to your opinion?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Taking a script to shape Casimodo into a hero in the dark. Don’t let any comedy or absurd drama be played,” said the playwright. “In fact, his appearance is a great reputation. When all the stars are handsome, people are handsome. When frightened, an ugly starring itself is the largest advertising <br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;I started to tour from a small place, so that he had the opportunity to hone his acting skills and then go to the big city. I believe that it will not take long for even the most discerning imperial city of Tintin Theatre to have a place for us. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a long time, Barrie admire, "You are the most awkward job seeker I have ever seen, talk about it, you are paying Claim. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Divided, if it is my script, every time I perform, I get 10% of the income." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That can't be, too high." And I haven't seen your work yet. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can try it first, and if you are welcome, start giving money." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran doesn't know, the hall downstairs, the two are deciding His future.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is considering resigning after the market closes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A humble job, slowly improve his revenge plan.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the last day of the market day, the troupe had more members.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the show, the head of Baru introduced to the group, "This is Mr. Lauren, and later A full-time playwright of the Cardinals. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we have our own playwright?" Nicole sighed with joy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran nodded to Lauren, since he had made up his mind to leave, then he could only simply bless the theater. Better development.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn’t expect it, it was the performance of the day that made him unable to leave.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the third performance, near dusk, the audience waited for the knight in the play, once again defeated the evil, and when the lover embraced the kiss, threw flowers to the stage.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
