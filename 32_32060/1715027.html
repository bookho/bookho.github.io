The policeman asked in that indifferent tone, " At 2 o'clock on the morning of October 21, why did you appear in the old district of Hongshu Square."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan hugged his hands around his chest and squinted Hey, leaning against the back of the teakwood chair, his expression was very leisurely. He even suggested in good faith, "I should give me a new chair. This rotten wood may not be able to bear my weight."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Answer the question, prisoner!" The secret policeman slammed the table and yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One, in the absence of a lawyer, I have the right to refuse any inquiry from the authorities; second, before the judicial verdict, my title is to assist the investigator Not a prisoner.” Fran shook his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a patrol station, but a security hall!" The secret police threatened. "Very good, you can keep your mouth shut, but we always There is a way to open, please believe that cooperation is good for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to Article 9 of Article 16 of the Byron Code, any law enforcement department is suspected People only have 48 hours of closed detention. More than this time, the judicial process must begin. The suspect can contact the outside world and hire a lawyer." Fran looked at the watch. It is already 8:00 in the morning. "There are 42 now. Hours, of course, treason or espionage is not listed here, but he spread his hands. "You have no evidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police are cold If the other party is an ordinary citizen, he has a lot of ways to make the hard-working guy pleading to reveal the color of the underwear that passed through ten years ago, but the information of the safety department tells him that the man in front is the city. The celebrity gentleman, even if he moved a small sentence, left any injuries on him. mark. It will cause trouble in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless there is an unmistakable instruction on the top, the secret police will not easily establish an enemy for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A cup of coffee, and a caviar toast." Fran said, "This requirement is also my right, in addition, to my friend Lila Miss Berry also sent a copy. Yes, I am a person who respects law and ethics very much, but I don’t want to see it in my friends two days later.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The secret police cursed a few times in the bottom of his heart and pushed the door out. He really hoped to send someone to tell him at this time. "We have enough evidence, you can use whatever method to do what you want. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullen closes his eyes and gently touches his chin with his thumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an ordinary dark policeman who came to interrogate the confession. Since coming to the Security Chamber, the group of people wearing the Blood Red Knight Medal. It never happened again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lurking in the shadow of the King of the King and the Security Department, the most mysterious blood knight dark police department. What is the conflict between the two? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has successfully played the role of a rich man in Tantin, and is also in the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not enough, go further. In order to grasp more opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a key thing, the secret of his body, will not be noticed by others. Fran does not believe that one of the highest rights institutions in Byron will not hold people with supernatural abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Fran suddenly opened his eyes and looked to the right with suspicion, but there were only bare, cool-toned walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment, he obviously felt that someone was spying on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"very extraordinary intuition." In the room next door to the interrogation room. A man wearing a gray plush robe wrinkled his eyebrows. "Just showed his probing, it caused his vigilance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No clues indicate that The Ingmar Lord is related to a secret association we are chasing. Another burly man flipped through the papers, "and the suspect named Lila Berry did not find any suspiciousness. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The woman has nothing to doubt, I am sure she is just an ordinary person who has no intention of getting involved in the accident." The gray robe man hesitated, "but Cassie." The Modo Bo Knight is worthy of study. He feels very strange. Just like the beast of the single can always be ten miles away. Smelling the existence of the ethnic group, the Master’s perception of the peers is always more sensitive. His body seems to be aware of the arcane atmosphere. No, not pure Austrian law..." He indulged for a moment, searching for the appropriate vocabulary, "...a more complex mixture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Bury Roch, we have another day and a half, enough to find out his secrets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not enough." Fanaticism about the unknown Perhaps it is a common problem for every mage. "I have to prepare for the soul to read the spells and media and thoroughly research it will take at least five days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to The law, at the latest, at dusk tomorrow, must be released.” The burly man reminded, “Lord Lord Knight is a social celebrity. Without evidence, we cannot explain it to the outside world.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does manufacturing perjury not be the strength of the secret police?" Court Master Berry replied in disapproval. "The murder is enough to make him disappear into the public eye."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a senior official of the Security Department walked into the room, holding a roll of open letter in his hand, "God Court Master, Captain Nine," the official said. "The director has just ordered, Mr. Quasimodo Bok, must be released immediately."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This works 16k novel network exclusive text version of the first release, without permission can not be reproduced, excerpts, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour ago. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most powerful prosecutor of the Justice Department of the Department of Justice, the grandfather of the family, and the Royal Crown Prince, who has many distinguished titles, is sneer Say "When does the secret police have the right to arrest officials who belong to me without the permission of the Judicial Office?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Leinschmann, safety The hall has the right to arrest the dangerous people without any subpoena.” The director of the Security Department, the head of Byron’s intelligence, Count Goldfrey, took off the singly spectacles hanging in front of the right eye. The security hall has been The important stronghold of the Emperor Party, he has no reason to give the face of the Queen of the Golden Sparrows in any matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good answer." Peggy stared at him, his face as if it was freezing cold frost. "It seems that you are ignoring the majesty of the Justice Department. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too excited. There is always a private agreement between the two departments of justice and security. I never ask the affairs of your office. The opposite is true." The director looked calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the speechless Peggy, Count Goldfrey laughed at her childishness and impulsiveness in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you follow the judicial process, there are at least five agreed-upon clauses that can order the Security Department to release immediately, but the Missy only knows hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stubbornness and arrogance will never be suitable for politics, and learning will not be smooth, and sooner or later will face failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the most outstanding woman in the new generation of the gorse family is just exaggerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be put it. She is just a big lady who relies on family power to make a fuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl eased his tone, and he smiled softly. "If we confirm that the Knights of the Knights are not malicious to Byron’s security, of course, they will act according to law. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I insist, release immediately." Peggy's words sounded like a petite child in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold Defoe converges on the smile, the Security Agency is his site, and he should have the final say. Do not allow others to gesticulate. The director stared at the girl and replied solemnly. "Do you want me to speak more thoroughly? If it is your father, or the head of the Hall of Justice, I may promise, but your position", he Emphasize, "It’s just a big prosecutor. Maybe you should go back and ask the two of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Goldford, what about me?" The office door was pushed open. "I am qualified?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness." Earl of Goldford stood up from the seat in amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crown Prince Julius has apparently stood in front of the door for a long time. I heard the conversation just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked the decorative black ceremonial cane on the ground and repeated it again, "If Miss Peggy is not qualified to intervene in the house of the security department. Then I What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal carriage is parked in the square in front of the security hall. This carriage is not too much decoration and carving, and it is unremarkable among the dozens of carriages in the parking space. The more often the unsuccessful upstarts, the more they like to use the seemingly extravagant things. Really powerful people will not use foreign objects to set off their status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least a dozen of royal guards wearing casual clothes scattered around the square, seeing the Crown Prince and the shovel coming out of the building, followed up without a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you." Peggy asked as he walked. "But you are very good. This is the majesty of your Highness." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius' face was immediately red. In the eyes of many people, the crown prince is gentle and temperament, as good as everyone, today is the first time he is angry at the minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said with some scorn, "I was on the road and met the Honourable Hola of the Presbyterian Church. He said that I saw you angered to the Security Chamber. I am worried..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Worry, what is the slick of Gao Defo, I will not eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "No. I don't mean this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, thank you very much for your help, I have to go back to the Justice Department, you have something else. "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to say... no, forget it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The figure of the fiancee disappeared into the carriage, and Julius's face showed a happy smile. He felt that Peggy seemed to be kind to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, are you going back to the palace?" The captain of the Royal Guard came to him and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that there is a jewellery auction today, there are two famous designs designed by the masters to be auctioned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Crown Prince thought for a moment, "The two necklaces, Miss Peggy, must be very nice to wear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy Don Rein Shiman leaned on the cushion of the carriage. She got up early today and had some sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Honourable Hora is doing a good job." Peggy covered her rosy lips with her back and yawned a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was instructed by Hora to reveal her whereabouts to the Crown Prince and achieved her goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
