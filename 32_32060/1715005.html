			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. In the evening, the deepest house in a hutong in the old district of Fedu, ushered in a special guest, the tenant is a cloth dealer who collects old clothes, listen To the knock on the door, "Who?" He speculated that it was bought and sold. When he opened the door, the pressure of a tall figure made the cloth dealers back two steps. The visitors stood in the shadows, wearing big hats, not seeing. Clear face, mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloth dealer slammed cold sweat, and he remembered that his rented house was a sinister house. He had a murder case a few years ago, but he waited for him to know the visitor. After a good start, he quickly dispelled his fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Can you let me in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you do?" The cloth dealers let go of the body and wondered why the rich people would come to this broken and rotten place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fifty Caesar, sir, you can borrow this room for one hour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The deal was quickly negotiated. The cloth dealer didn’t even ask the other person what purpose he had. He touched the ticket in his pocket, walked out of the house, stood outside the alley, and found a step to kneel and touch the smoke. Tsui. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, what are you doing here?" asked someone who knew him passing by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must not believe it when you say it." The cloth dealer proudly said, "I can earn fifty for an hour in this station."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get it, you are a fan of money who wants to be crazy." The person who heard the speech laughed, no one believed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloth dealer shrugged and continued to smoke, he looked at the rented house under the night, the broken house, unbelievable, "have Qian Qian is a neuropathy that likes to do strange things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Frey is walking slowly in the room, the faint candlelight is swaying, furniture Placed on the ground to cast a huge shadow, under the bright light, the hoarse and dull sound of the boots on the rot floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't make trouble, the meal is not good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you let me kiss once again, let go of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wang, Wang..." The puppy shook his tail and complained that the masters were slow-moving. Not ready for food yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kitchen is now a storage room full of debris, only a small cabinet nailed to the wall. The black mark left by the lampblack reminds me that it was once smog, and the food was scented. He closed his eyes as if looking for memories of the past, for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the living room, go up the stairs, touch the handrails of the paint banquet, in a bedroom on the second floor. He stopped and stared at the wall of the window, engraved with traces of the road, which he had sent after his cover letter, in the days of anticipation of uneasiness, self-comfort calculations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a poor but happy family here, reviving here, identifying the goals of the new life, but also here, shed the blood of his family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the resurrection. I came back here for the first time. It was the last time." Fran gently said to himself, "has changed, whether it is People. Still things. Eternal, only memories and time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked out of the gate, Fran sighed at the air of the night, "I sigh here." What can be changed? If it has happened, it will not come back. The murderers have not yet disciplined them. They have given me the cruel means. It is very good. I have learned it and will follow the lesson. I will go back. Igo Andrei killed me, I gave it back. The gorse ruined my life, I also ruined its future, and the accomplice called Joe Coleon... the penalty is equal, this is It is the justice of the human world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked out of the alley, took the horse, left the old district, on the way out of the city, passing the square in front of the patrol hall. Stayed a little. "Old friend, bless you." Fran recited the name of Inspector Lyme. Every year at the birth of the inspector, he would mail an anonymous gift in the past. "I hope that I will continue to bless you in the future."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, he left the fee and stopped looking back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ifetz is a noisy town, because it is located on the main road from the Gulf to the capital, the traffic is comparable to some big cities, the accommodation service industry is developed, there are 24 large hotels with rooms in the town. The St. George Hotel is one of the best. The old restaurant, formerly known as the “Old Alcoholic”, is known for its high-alcoholic liquor. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a few decades ago, the sacred master of Saint George VII, who lived in the old drunkard for a night, the savvy master immediately changed the name of the store George, to commemorate this decent honor, and the emperor's room was changed into a super-luxury suite, which was only available to the governors of the passing road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He explored the route of the Cardinals to Tantin, knowing that the troupe booked a whole room on the first floor of the St. George Hotel, but because of the small path, it came early. one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran in the green vestibule of the tree, said to the waiter who came to the reception, "Is the guest full?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are still a few rooms." The waiter took the reins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He entered the hotel lobby, because of the superior height, and after taking off the hat, the strange appearance quickly attracted the attention of the hotel guests, "瞧 just came in The person in the land is like a monster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe the officer who retired from the battlefield." Someone looked and guessed, "Look at those scars, really horrible, dead." Crawling out of the pile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is it an officer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘿, The soldier can't afford to live in St. George. Didn't see the coat with the floral ornament and the gold thread, the authentic brand goods. I guess this person has at least the rank of major."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There are some strange ladies who stare at the strong body and put the fan on their faces and companions. "This person should have many bizarre stories, maybe invite him at dinner. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, the story may be interesting, but looks will affect appetite." The female partner giggled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashionable Chinese clothing can save a lot of trouble, if it is not this clothes, I can't even enter the door. Fran thought, he came to the front desk, "One room, two days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, please register." The front desk clerk explained, "This is the rule of the town, and the guest has to register."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Casimomodo · The Knights of the Knights, who have the title of Lord of the United Kingdom." Fran answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight of the Knights is the surname of the Ingma of the island nation. Before the departure, Fran wanted to get the forged Lord's certificate and detailed background information, and to the foreign aristocracy. The identity of the Byron officially booked, want to investigate the authenticity of this title, must be directed to the distant Ingmar investigation, time-consuming and laborious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter quickly wrote down a few lines on the booklet, then took the key with the number of the house number off the shelf behind him. You have a good time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lived in the third floor of No. 307, on the way to the room. Fran received an invitation to a young Viscount who was carrying his wife and was on vacation. People of the upper class are always full of curiosity and interest in new things. In particular, I found out that there are suddenly more strange members in my class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can save time, I hope to have dinner with you," said the Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am honored." Fran nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first step, I have to gradually enter the aristocratic circle of Byron. The new identity and the current reputation of the Cardinal Theatre Company are quite good help and disguise. "After agreeing to meet the specific hour, Fran thought on the side of the stairs." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, an impetuous man swept into the hotel in a gust of wind, and he called the manager, "I am a consultant to the Cardinal Star Theatre Company. It is expected that the troupe will arrive in the morning, but will go fast, and will arrive at around 7 pm, hoping that the room is ready."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course. This is a big deal. Even if your group comes one day early, it doesn't matter." The manager showed the compliment and service quality of the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good." The consultant sighed. "I rode on horseback for a few hours and gave me a meal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow me." The manager made a "please" gesture. Then I whispered to the consultant's ear and said, "Can you get a copy of Ms. Nicole's signature?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." The consultant patted the chest. He just left with the manager. The waiter who was screaming at the ear was immediately picked up. Then, the news of the coming of the Cardinal Star Troupe was spread in the hotel. There are a few guests who are ready to catch the night, and they stayed for a night and wanted to see the big stars in close quarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the news reached the ears of Fran, he was talking to the Viscounts at the Salon on the second floor. "That night, I repelled at least ten pirates. Oh, the scar on the left face was left that time. When we stayed until dawn, we finally took the treasure and waited for the ship to be supported by the reinforcements." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please talk about your adventures. Especially the legendary Shangri-La." The Viscount heard the excitement, and Fran’s vivid depiction of his life Experience: A noble warrior who likes to travel around, in the eyes of the Viscount. He is already a big adventurer, the brutal black continent, the infinite desert of Mamuk, and even the more distant Shangri-La, have left his footprints. He has been exposed to herbal medicine since childhood, his father's notes on the East, the wealth of knowledge that Master William taught him, and his excellent eloquence and imagination, so that Fran can hold every detail and perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scars and ugly appearances, but the Viscount feels that this should be the case, this is a risky, adventurer who wants to fight with the barbarians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he put on thoughtful clothes, appeared in the salon, elegant talk and manners, but also shows that this is a civilized person with higher education, wild and Reason, in this gentleman's body, the fusion is perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, that’s a land that only appears in dreams, the wide walls are stretched, defending the land ten times more than Byron, maybe some Disrespectful, but I am only telling the truth." Fran looked at the silk ribbon on the Viscountess's hat. "In Shangri-La, this quality silk is full of streets."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I really admire the ladies in that country." The Viscountess said, "This hat can cost four hundred sesame."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Cannot compare with the country of dreams, just like the great monarch, can not compare the majesty of the kingdom of heaven." Fran comforted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just said that you used to be an emperor in Shangri-La?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, this is the glory of life, just as your interest in Shangri-La is strong. The emperor who ruled the infinite territory is also curious about the West. I have spent ten days in the royal palace where the ground is gold. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really glory." The Viscount lamented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a greater honor, I was given the title of Zheng Zhiqing by the Emperor Shangri-La."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The Viscount is chanting this strange noun and pronunciation, "Zheng Zhiqing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the Western aristocratic title, Shangri-La divides the upper class into ten ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what is Zheng Zhiqing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said it Before you, please be aware that in the West, Zheng Zhiqing is only a simple honor, and has no practical meaning."Frankonton, "two products."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Day, in the East, you are at least a Marquis." The Viscount exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscountess asked, "His Lord Zhizhi Qing," she is happy with this fresh title, "So what are you doing now? Planning the next adventure?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the blood of adventure is still boiling, but a man should create his own career, not the adventure and the reputation of the ethereal, I invested A troupe, and is looking for a new investment project in Byron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The troupe!" The Viscountess asked with interest, "Can you tell the name?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, called the Cardinals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it turns out that let us be in St. George The reason for the encounter.” The Viscountess shouted, “This famous star theater company is about to arrive at the hotel.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I was in an adventure for more than a year I used to leave the Cardinals, and I am waiting for it now.” Fran said, “Prove that my investment is correct, it has developed quite well. & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp "<br <br /> & nbsp />;</div>
