			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. In the morning, when Lauvita came to the study, her eyes were sore by the diffuse smoke. She saw Fran burying her head between her elbows and kneeling on the desk, seemingly sleeping. There is a chess piece on his hand, the chess face is a mess, and the black pawn is left behind. The king is alone on the sideline of the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only remaining soldier is only one step away from the white bottom line, and the other side will be handsome, the queen, the elephant and the car, firmly protect the white king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glass ashtray is placed on the corner of the table, and the cigarette holders inside are piled up like a hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm not used to it." Lauvita looked at the man's generous shoulders, the wrists and neck that were not covered by clothes, showing staggered reddish scars. It is very different from the image she is familiar with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head, walked lightly, opened the curtain, pushed the window away, let the morning sun and the fresh air come in, and then looked around the room. I want to find a blanket to cover the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am not asleep." She heard the sound of the chair moving, and turned back, Fran had already sat up, and her face was not tired. Traces, but revealed extremely energetic energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a night chess with yourself?" the girl said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say, who will win?" Fran swayed to the chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White, the situation is too obvious." Lauvita leaned over and pushed White's image to the slash and ate the black side. The pawn, "The black man has no chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Fran stroked the piece that was taken off, "If Black is Me, that White is my opponent. They only need to move their fingers to end this confrontation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luovita looks at it blankly Fran, "I know you have enemies, but I have never said anything to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are powerful and intricate." Fran answered, "And I can The pieces that are in control are very pitiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reality is not playing chess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world is a big chessboard." Fran is very cautious. "You still have time to quit, holding millions. Wealth leaves Byron and enjoys the colorfulness of life. It is so happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s eyes and lips are bent into thin, beautiful curves, showing the surplus Smile, "Yes, don't eat and wear, the first thing to get up every day is to think about how to spend the money in the purse, to date with a handsome man, and to be friends with celebrities. It's a great life. But I can't go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't you go back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You can be responsible. You brought me to the present life and made me fall in love with the sweetness brought by the excitement and tricks.” Seeing what Fran wanted to say, Lauvita made a "Sound" action, continue to say, "I know what my happiness is, so don't choose for me." She came over and took a black elephant and placed it next to the king. . "Oh. If I join, there will be one more black piece, and the game that will be defeated will be reversed. It will make me feel happy when I defeat the unbeatable opponent."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a premise that she didn't say it, just thinking in her heart, "Of course, stay with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Staring at the girl, the city silent for a while. "Some things, I should tell you." He pointed at the chessboard, "My enemy. One is the gorse, the famous family of Byron, the king and the white elephant, It represents it; the other you know, it is the shadow king, two white cars are them. And power, money, etc., is the eight pawns of White, my strength, can not swallow any one. And. You will be eaten at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What plans do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" One step, that is, I came to Tantin and have been doing it: let White ignore my black soldier who is lurking around, and it is still successful; , it is to create an enemy that makes them feel incredible. "Fran put a black car in the middle of the chessboard, and moved the white car like a pawn, surrounded it, "to make this non-existent threat To attract the king's firepower, and my soldiers can reach the bottom line more smoothly, and become the most powerful queen in chess, crushing the white king." He took the king and pushed him down. All the pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita listened with great interest and asked, "You forgot, White has a queen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is the key." Fran revealed A strange smile, "Maybe you have heard of her: Peggy Don Leinschman. This is a piece that does not conform to the rules, can eat my soldiers, and can eat the power of this side." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a real queen." Lauvita apparently had already heard the name of Byron’s surname from the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a button on the interests of the enemy. I have to know what the king wants, what the queen wants, and surrender to their car and elephant." What do you want? Let them not get what they want, cut the fragile button, the black and white sides of the board are too bad for me. If you can get more red square green square blue, you can Defeated separately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A towering castle, and a pile of unrelated stones, of course, the latter is a good deal." Lauvita agreed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan stood up straight, picked up the ashtray, went to the corner of the paper, and dumped the ashes. "There is one more thing, I have seen your analysis." The movie king’s report, everything that happened in the limestone mountains, you will repeat it in detail.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Weita licked his hair with his fingers and put the time The scene is completely depicted, "...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eight fine gunners with weapons, no resistance in front of the woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Women?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Like a devil-like woman.” Lauvita’s leg is a little cramp, the kind of swing The horror of not going to make her very uncomfortable, the girl vaguely aware that this fear does not seem to be psychologically flustered, but rather a kind of awe that seems to be instinctive, just like seeing the beast will escape, it will tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How tall is she?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly shorter than me, one meter six five Around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the appearance? For example, the color of hair and barley."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blonde, green eyes, purely look, like a harmless girl, but the hand is very poisonous, and, I always think she..." Lauvita held her forehead, her eyebrows tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think?" Fran asked, and the voice conveyed an unclear tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel very familiar, just like 堑淖? (The original text is like this)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sore, she seems to have seen the female demon somewhere long ago, is it... Feidu? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luovita loves a good-hearted prostitute, who and his wife have opened food stalls in the suburbs’ market, and they have countless times. Stand far away. Look at them enviously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I made a lot of money today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our chain restaurant, more Two bricks, plus a sculpture at the gate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, do you think the name is not?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the convenience restaurant called Anmei?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it should be called Fulan and Anmei chain convenience restaurant."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, they gathered at the booth and talked with dreams, the happy smile on the face. It seems to be light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl struggled to break free from the bleak memories. "No, nothing." She replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female demon cannot be the cute wife of the prosecutor. Although the appearance is very similar, but the temperament is completely different, how can a woman who is as light as a playful kitten, in just a few years, become a killer of a horrible dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautetta thought that after listening to the head, he would be angry and shocked. Maybe it will be a little nervous. But Fran turned silently and took out two lambskin bags from the drawer. Lauvita curiously opened the bag and smelled the smell of sour herbs floating from the inside. "Plant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A pair of wounds on the wound, another boiled and then washed, is good for your injury, and will not leave scars." Fran nodded, he said to the girl, "You go out first, let me alone I want to be sad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hoarse voice, and the sudden exhaustion, made Lauvita feel very uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This whole day, Fran locked himself in the study. No one cares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An Mei, is that you? What did they do to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day Once again, the room was dark and dark, with screw-shaped hangers, dark wood-grained mahogany desks, walnut-wrapped sofa chairs, wall-side bookcases, wall-mounted decorative paintings, zenith chandeliers. And those who sit as statues, these inanimate and animate, are dead in the night. The cold autumn wind slammed in the corner of the eaves, wailing, letting the glass window gently tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive me for not being smart enough. I can't think of a faster and more sensible way to save you from the control of the enemy; please forgive me, I still try my best. Keep calm... If you are condemned, you dare to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, extract, more recent The fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of guests on the second day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Barry Silana squatted at a bag of freshly sourced food from the market and came to Fran’s house. She squatted as soon as she entered the door. In the training class, I learned how to make mashed broccoli and duck, mushroom stewed beef tenderloin... Hey, Casimodo?” She asked Lauville, who was sitting in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Emergency, the boss is working upstairs. I think, don't bother him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh, let you try my craft." Barry has regarded Lauvita as a close friend, a staff member of love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, breakfast is too greasy, it will ruin your appetite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is easy to send the head of the team, and Moore of the construction line followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauvita talked with him about what happened recently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, the last attempt of the head to make that woman repent?" The girl frowned, "how can the character of the head not change."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pity is also a manifestation of majesty. Da..." Moore thought about the name. "If the Dalmark female barker shuts up, she will go abroad, then she will Although he can't be rich in his life, he can be safe and peaceful. It is better than being loaded into a sea boat and becoming a lifelong slave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it is more pity, majesty The ash girl said faintly, "With the ability of the head, if the wrist is more tough and cold, you don't have to be entangled in those imaginary so-called justice, he has now become the most powerful master of the underground world. 1."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore is obviously reluctant to criticize the values ​​of his respected person. He changed the topic and said, "What is the relationship between Mr. and his godfather?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just need to know that he is trustworthy." Lauvita back . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I almost forgot, I came to report to Mr. Bo, the authorities just sent someone to inform, the underground tunnel engineering design of the building, already The review was passed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I will pass it on to the head." When Lauttata spoke, she noticed that she had lost her word, she added. "This project also has a private investment, and cooperated with Mr. Bo Knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After letting Moore leave, the girl secretly condemned her panic, she was worried Looking upstairs, the head started from yesterday, and he did not go downstairs in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the beginning, the head was not wrong." The girl thought about the change of Fran, "From what I mentioned, the female dragon, he It became very strange, but it was not because the enemy was strong and uneasy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stared at the ceiling and thought about it. A few hours later, a footstep on the stairway interrupted Lavetta’s analysis. She saw Fran wearing a shirt and slowly walked down. The two buttons on the top of the dress were not tied, and the sturdy Chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, Moore has just been here, he said that the government has passed the drawing." Lauvita did not ask her doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the future, you will be responsible for all the affairs on the open side of the building. You don't have to know me. Also, keep me on Matta Hepburn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Architectural I will handle it properly, but the holy warrior, although controlled by the pharmacy, is always an uneasy factor." Lauvita said. Fran had told her about some of the holy warriors. Although it was not clear the source of the grudges between them, Lauvita knew that the girl was hostile to her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She still has the use, of course, refers to the case of being controlled again." Fran said, "Once she finds out, she has signs of waking up and immediately clears Off, what I want is a puppet listening to the command, not an enemy." "Yeah." Lauvita aimed at Fran and continued to ask, "That is about our enemy, how to prepare to change that chessboard." Got confused?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan is very slow, flowing with a very cold calm, cold and pale, "a famous reputation, no one can shake Family, what do you need most? Wealth? They are at your fingertips. Status is already in their bag. So it is their pursuit to stabilize the existing glory until the next generation.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Shadow King, a group of people with supernatural ability to make all the gangs in the dark awe, why should they be attached to others? Because they do not satisfy the benefits brought by the underground world.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that Missy, never likes to be a man, People are at the mercy. I obey the appointment and become the props of the family to control the royal family? I think this thought has never appeared in her thoughts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between people, total They don’t trust each other, especially those who like to play tricks. One wants to firmly grasp the power, one wants to reach out to power, one does not want power to be in the hands of others. Just like the three rivers that meet, sooner or later they will fight for each other. Road, rushing the river embankment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten years, or twenty years, accumulating wealth, looking for enemy weaknesses, is the most appropriate. But I have no patience to accompany They played. They had to explode the fragile levee in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lautetta felt that the head had changed a bit overnight. But she can't say where it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, I need an expert who is good at forging documents and imitating handwriting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
