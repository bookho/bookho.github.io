			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Giblen is a highly respected old man in the country, born with a compassionate face, everyone loves him, and his daily actions are also worthy of respect. . The population here is very small, and only a few of them are nearly persuaded. They are located on a hillside. It is a typical set of defeated villages. There are no factories, shopping malls and hotels, and no investors want to develop nearby land. They open the leeks and the sore fields on the hillsides, raise chickens and sheep, grind wheat, bake hard bread with dried sheep dung, cook with straw and dead branches, self-sufficiency, and live an original way of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is under the jurisdiction of a small town at the foot of the mountain, but because it is too poor, the government never takes it to the attention of the tax official who arrives on time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the old gods not only have to take care of the spiritual life of the villagers, but also help their real life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poverty pastors, unpaid agent township heads, dispute mediators, teachers and doctors, wedding and funeral arrangers, children's baptists." There are many titles that are as cumbersome as he is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lives in a simple wooden chapel with old benches and wineglass-like sermons, but the planks on the left side of the table are split. Let it look like a broken glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old god has been preaching for twenty years in the local area. It is said that when the local church selected personnel, many of the gods hesitated because of the poor environment of the poor mountains. Later, Gibran later Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was still a four-year-old middle-aged man who stood up and said, "I will go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The same secretly warned him, "Gui Shen, there is nothing but a countryman who is covered in sheep dung."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, heaven is not Tell me that redemption and kindness also discriminate," he replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he went and took root, and the regional church was qualified as a god. The worst was also promoted to the deacon of the cathedral, but he still silently cared for a group of heavenly people in the forgotten corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially, he gathered residents every week and carried out a simple mass in the broken church, but soon he found that the children had no teachers and some ten Years old. Still can't write your own name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knowledge and belief are equally important. Faith is a spiritual comfort, and knowledge is a weapon that changes life." Jishen delusion, so he went out of town, the residents guessed the new god, could not stand the pain When he took his own short-legged scorpion and came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pocket is full of pens, inks, and small books, and there are some books. The gods said to the curious villagers, "Let the children come every afternoon." Church. I will teach them. "This is of course completely free. He also refused to collect money and even refused to be grateful and invited him to dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I take one more meal. The child will take less nutrition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years, There are many children who grow up and want to go out to the outside, but they are terrified about the unknown world. The old god encourages him. "Fear is just a layer of fog, making many things look vague, but just go forward. One step, go through, you will find it. In fact, it is just like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people made a small fortune and took their family to live in the city, but there was no enlightenment The teacher expressed any gratitude. He does not agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old god is the richest man in the town. He has an old donkey and two sheep. Every quarter the church will distribute a sum of money to all the churches. But he is often empty, because he has adopted three homeless orphans, to invest in all the children who are studying to buy stationery, to supplement the lonely elderly who do not have the ability to live. Maintain and repair the church that is older than him, lest it collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now aware that Gibran is a brilliant saint and a pillar of goodness and obscurity. But the reason why he appeared in your vision was because the old god had picked up a small robber who was alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a month ago, the old god was riding the same aging scorpion, just after returning money from the regional cathedral, two hundred, half now Half of the coins, a lot of change and a lot of money, it seems to be bulging. He used a quarter of the city to buy some essential materials: a few stacks of cheap paper, candles, two packs of fertilizer and candy for the students to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slope of the mountain road has not been repaired over the years, and once the old scorpion fell into the sunken place on the road, almost broke the leg, so the gods will mount when going up the mountain Taking hold, every time I return to the town, people are still tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shrine passed by a small forest in the afternoon, and he thought about resting his feet and taking a breath in the shade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he tied the scorpion to the tree, let it eat the young grass, and found the bread and water from the pocket, and had a religious meal. After the ritual, sit on the grass and cut the hard bread with a small iron knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scorpion suddenly struggled with uneasiness, and he saw a man in a gray robes, a short stature in front of him, holding a sharp short sword in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Handed over...delivered it...give it to me..." The voice was hoarse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hug?? I found that I just received the money and came from the city?" God thought sadly, because no robbers would rob a Wearing a broken scorpion to the poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the compassion of the kingdom to the poor, the children's books." Gibran tried to discourage, but if the other party came hard, he could not stop it. Although this person is generally taller than him, the god is an individual with a weak individual, and there is only one worn knife in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Teach...will?" The voice of the man became lighter, and the eyes under the cloak seemed to be flickering, but he slowly walked over. Quickly took a small and half-cut bread from the hands of Gibran, burying his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This black wheat-baked bread is very hard, it is hard to swallow without water, and the robber coughs up, like being caught in the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old god looked at him silently, and he discovered that the man’s robes were dirty and broken, and the hair that was hanging out was covered with lime. The toe of the boot with the boot of the boot has been worn with the socks inside, and the black toes have blood flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the short blade that is so refined and uninformed, this person is more like a robber than a robber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He breathed a sigh of relief, and his compassionate heart let him hand over the water. "Drink, eat slowly, if not, I still have it." The other person's back was patted, but the man fell down in shock, and the bread residue in his hand spilled over the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't... don't touch me... I am... a sinner." The man said hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old god thought that the other party was repenting for the robbery. He crossed a cross on his chest. "The lamb of the lost of heaven. You are the good boy of the Lord. Otherwise, you will not wait for you to be hungry, for the sake of your life. The food came to rob the passerby."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man raised his face and slid down the cloak on his head, and there was a confused look in his eyes, though Yan Rong It was full of black ash and dirt, but the old god was still recognized. This is a young girl who has just grown up and is very affectionate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local residents saw their love of the Jebelon deities at dusk, and they took the mount to the village entrance. They warmly greeted them and found the scorpion sitting. A dirty girl with bare feet, the whip hung beside the saddle, the two feet were swollen, broken, and some wounds showed signs of inflammation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord Bishop (they know that he is only a god. But only to call this name can express a strong respect). Who is this lady?" They asked, Estimated is the orphan who was picked up by Mr. God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Heaven Congress shines on every lamb." Sure enough, the god replied. He asked the others, "Jerry brothers, please help me to move the fertilizer to the shed at the edge of the field. Everyone will use it tomorrow; Mrs. Medo, is there still ginger in your house? I have to burn some ginger water. Give the child a foot so that it does not cause inflammation and septicemia..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole village is busy, everyone wants to work hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some herbs, old clothes, and half-stayed chicken. Sent to the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medida Hepburn - we all have guessed it is her - the expression is stiff and looks around this extremely simple chapel, the chair is long The wooden strips are made up, and the evangelical altar is short and old. It is hung on the main wall. The bright print of the wooden relief is wiped clean, but it can be seen quite a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a force in it, this is not an imposing but deadly lobby, everyone comes in. There will be prayers from the heart, and there will be faith, respect and love in the eyes. Ma Tida feels the glory and brilliance it contains, which makes her fearful, clenched her fists and shakes her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three orphans adopted by the old gods, the largest just turned thirteen years old, is a simple and diligent good girl, she curiously asked the newly joined sister, "Who are you? Is there a name? My name is Ai Wei."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who am I?" She did not know what to answer, the samurai Matilda, the mad believer Matilda, and the unclean Madata. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She chose a direction and walked aimlessly. No matter which way, she could not see the future. The pain of confusion is shackles, prisoners, and she binds herself to the dark day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sewer monster, the heretical devil..." Matilda has a goal, she prayed to kill it and let herself go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she didn’t dare to do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thought is to break the ship on the dangerous ship, the last food; the victim of the lost position in the desert, the residual water in his hand. Obviously hungry and thirsty, but dare not go to eat and drink, because there is still a piece of water and a piece of bread, there is hope for survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the words of the Mamolks, this is the ostrich mentality that buried the head in the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's dead, I can't go back, what should I do?" The girl didn't want to continue thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do? The supreme heaven! What to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl afflicted her body in a self-abuse manner, walking like a dead body, only retaining the requirements of the bottom line of survival. She had no money, she was so hungry that she turned over the trash can in the back alley of the restaurant, ate the stinky scum, slept under the wet and cold eaves, and was cast a curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until she met the old god, the girl was not willing to grab, but did not find the hunger of food, the instinct of survival, destroying reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are homeless?" asked the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be afraid, then, come with me." The old man reached out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spicy ginger with a spicy smell stung the wound of the ankle, it can eliminate the bacteria, inhibit inflammation, Ai Wei looked at the red and swollen legs, Sympathetically, "How many roads have you gone? It’s pitiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little orphan girl kneels down and holds a towel. She wants to wipe her feet. The samurai girl hurriedly retracted her legs, overturned the basin, and the brown ginger water splashed two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Wei looked at her with surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I come by myself," Matilda explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that you are not dumb." Ai Wei happily handed the towel over. "The water has already burned a large bucket, just put it in the back room, you have to go." Take a good bubble and wash it together for dinner.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the table, Gibran’s god was surprised by the renewed Matilda, who was brought to the ground by Mrs. Set of old clothes, cheeks are also a little thin because of lack of nutrition, the spirit is still listless, but the girl has a gift that is different from ordinary people, the experience of the elderly tells the gods, she is not like an orphan who is poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old god noticed that her dining posture was very ceremonial in detail, as if it was not a mashed chicken in front of her, but a feast at the banquet. This is not a special purpose. It has been an education and etiquette training that has been received and has penetrated into the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More shockingly, although she doesn’t talk much, she uses elegant words, including many vocal honors. Some religious words are only Anno The high-level of the church will be used, and the old gods will only hear it from the mouth of the regional bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a clergyman? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the meal, she did not pray before the meal to thank the heavenly gifts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, this is a child, the kingdom will guide her way." The old god finally dismissed the idea of ​​asking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old god family lives in a wooden house connected to the church, including a dining room, three bedrooms, the roof is covered with thatch, and there is a piece behind the house. Since the home cooking, the rapeseed and the green catch in the soil have sprouted the tender yellow shoots, the corner of the garden is circled with a wooden fence, and the two sheep and the old donkey are staying inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven-year-old Mali and the five-year-old Kerry sleep in the bedroom on the left, and the old god lives in the innermost room, which also has a part-time study and prayer. The function of the room, Ai Wei is a half-large girl, so she can have a bedroom alone, she is very happy to finally have a companion at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
