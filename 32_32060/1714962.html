			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"锵..." The head of the group was stunned, and the gray pottery bowl filled with fish soup in his hand fell straight, splashing the soup, scattered in the same way. Nicole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the dish broke and woke her up, and she panicked and picked up the broken bowl into pieces, which was shattered by accident. Tao cut his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your daughter?" Nicole pointed to the girl like a little bear, lying on the back of Fran. "How old are you? 40 years old? Such a big daughter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris is very happy to have a partner of similar age, she ran over and tried to pinch the little face of Matida, but immediately She was bitten by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two girls, who met for the first time, immediately became enemies. Paris squinted at the back of her hand and looked at Martida with anger, while the latter, very uneasy Moved the body, used Fran's body as a barrier, beware of the person who wanted to pinch her face, and then make an annoying movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Casimodo, your wife, must be a beauty." The playwright compliments in a compliment, "Can you tell me the specifics? This is a wonderful material in the drama."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, this is my private matter." Fran refused politely, he patted Matilda's head, " Hungry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, not hungry, but I want to eat..." Matidda pouted. "That kind of sweet thing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, go back to the room and go to sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl walks up the stairs obediently, The pace is not stable, the seventeen-year-old, behaving, and two or three-year-old children, no difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big man, your daughter, isn't it..." Nicole ordered his head. "In the country, such a big girl is married." But she..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please don't ask." Fran said, "Where is the next tour of the troupe, where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Josei or Sevia." The head of the team regained his calmness, but his eyes still intentionally or unintentionally slammed upstairs. "Lauren, can your new work be completed before then?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be possible, but Mr. Quasimodo, your acting skills are still to be honed. Our goal is not limited to small cities, but to the splendid Tandoor Theatre."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullan blows away the red pepper floating on the fish soup, "Tetin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, you have this qualification, provided that Developed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to Tantin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest reason for Fran to join the troupe is to have a reasonable identity, otherwise, with a huge sum of money, stay at the Imperial City Hotel, what investment does not do. People will inevitably attract the attention of the secret police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, now there is a baggage, the samurai with damaged brain, he has not decided how to arrange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing her at the door of a church? No, at the moment, she can't get in touch with Guangming's seal. Otherwise, the next time, a team of holy warriors will find out why the girl was hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way is to solve it silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously impossible, if he can, he has already started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran looked at his own hand, the strange healing power, he had to study better, it is not clear whether there are restrictions, will he Patchwork ** creates a hazard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the best idea, he has a new plan. Since he is still unable to fight against the secular power, he has to rely on non-secular power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the samurai girl will come in handy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran said to Lauren, "Okay, let's take the time to discuss the script, goal: Tantin."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The playwright is preparing to say something, and the building has uploaded Matilda and screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone followed Fran upstairs, the door just opened, the girl jumped out of bed and flew to Fran's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror of the nightmare made the girl incoherent. She sobbed and said intermittently, "Fire, a lot of white light, Dad, Dad..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dream, wait for you Go buy candy." Fran comforted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is getting calmer, she is so horrified that she feels pitiful and makes Barrie motherhood. "Casimodo, you will accompany your daughter, I will go to the store to buy some sugar cane." Sugar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the stairs went down, Nicole snickered and said, "Head, why go to please the daughters of people so soon?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small mouths, dead hoes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know who the big man used to be, see his daughter The pretty face, his wife must be a big beauty, but what happened, let them separate, mentally handicapped daughter, can find a father in the sea, it is really a god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, what happened?" Barry thought thoughtfully, and she soon discovered that Nicole smiled strangely and squatted at her waist. "What do you think?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing." Nicole ran away cautiously and then asked, "Head, which color wedding dress is better?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I like the white ...... ah ...... "Ballet Rui slip of the tongue, rare, she blushed, very angrily towards Nicole stared eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heaven, how the head of the group is like a little girl, really likes the individual, and at night, she detaches her clothes and knocks on the other’s door." Nicole unrestrained Shrugging and thinking, "However, the big man is attractive, the world is getting more and more strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran sitting on the bed On the side of the chair, Ma Dida took his hand and looked at the sleeping face of Miss Saint Samurai. He thought, "The brain that has been hurt is hard to recover, but I must be careful, like the danger of yesterday, never Allow to appear again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Miss, I have already said, next time, I will never show mercy, so please live in the fantasy of childhood. Don't be awake, don't bring in the future that I don't want to face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salam Town, the local smuggling head, was awakened by the sound of the door lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He secretly took the dagger from under the pillow, and the woman who was crazy with him for the night was still asleep, if it was an enemy, it was just a shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sky is bright, are you still asleep?" The girl wearing a purple-black robes, already standing by the bed, was very dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, Miss Corleone." The smuggling sigh of relief, but still scared, he was very alert to observe the door, but this mysterious Mo The measured lady still escaped his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get me a room, I have to take a day off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your mission Finished? Remember the headquarters..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up, what qualification do you have to ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, yes, please forgive me, I will arrange it right away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the underground world, this group of unnatural characters, smuggling heads can not sin . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He draped his clothes and thought of something," Miss Corleone, probably a week ago, a noble gentleman, left me a business card. I want to meet with the leader of Igo, who seems to be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give it to me and hand it over for you." The girl interrupted him rudely and didn't want to listen again. Go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room where the smuggling head is arranged is very luxurious, the spotless floor is neat and tidy, the exquisite breakfast and refreshments are ready, the smell of the food, and the corner The dark green musk on the lacquer case blends with the faint laurel fragrance, and Miss Coleon leans on the soft feather mat, wrinkling her face, a little bit counteracting the magic of discomfort in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, she easily stretched her brow and gracefully picked up the thin porcelain flower cup and took a few teas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
