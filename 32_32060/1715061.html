At 8:30 in the evening, the Liujin Avenue where the business hall gathers is different in the daytime, in a quiet atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of the house number is 64, and there are still a few lights on. Occasionally, a few late-duty staff members, when passing by, did not think differently, "Hey, overtime is really a bitter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran's company is already on The track, the old office building has been refurbished and looks quite a bit. The one-and-a-half-height half-wall divides the interior into a number of small compartments, artificially drawing the building and separating the area. The security room, the clerical room, and the equipment room are on the ground floor, and the design engineers are concentrated on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Office of the President occupies more than half of the top floor and is elegantly decorated. The walls are inlaid with soundproofed brown-yellow carved cork, and the edges of the doors and windows are also covered with a pad. Even if there is an earthquake inside, it is difficult to hear the sound outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The construction industry is very profitable. If it develops benign, it can get the return of the investment amount every year." Lauvita looked at the financial statements and commented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to be a risk speculator who ran a ticket and ran in the eyes of others. It has a solid industry and can better conceal its purpose." Fran answered that he was sitting on a leather chair with wooden handrails and was looking through a list of whispers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Weita licked the sore shoulders, she was too busy these two days, dealing with the trivial matters of the firm, through the private channels to get some proficient people The way of contact, but the girl is full of excitement, she is accompanying the beloved man, in a disparity in the gambling game, compete with the enemy to compare wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more fun than this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mele is a veteran and has a close relationship with the gang, faithful and trustworthy." She suggested that the girl walked to the window sill, opened the louver, and the window In the night, full of stars and lights, far from hope. The starry sky in the sky seems to be integrated with the light of the city. The night sky and the frontiers of the earth are no longer distinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ruben Neger..." Fran stayed on a name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this person I have heard a little, he is very exaggerated, and is on the verge of bankruptcy. People who are not low-key and urgently need money. It is very unsafe." Lauvita asked with interest, she submitted to Fran On the list, all are in the forgery of the line as a master of excellence. Why is she wondering why she will choose him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meil is more reliable, but he is not in Byron, there are a few good candidates, but it took them half a month to find them. And Nigel At present, people are in Perast, only one day away from Tantin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The royal wedding is just five days later, when the lady has a formal name, what kind of action will she make?" Fran's eyebrows revealed inexplicable troubles. "Before that.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be ready."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article 16k novel network exclusive text The first version of the version, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpts, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perast is a wealthy town where the middle class gathers, next to Tantin, and Ruben Nigel is a famous person in the town. He runs a art dealership, often publishes an art commentary in the newspaper, lives in a private luxury villa, likes polo, and spends as many as 150,000 tickets per year on the polo team. It reveals the breath of successful people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is a leader, and Mr. Ruben Nigel’s external identity is a well-mixed connoisseur and art dealer, but in some In the eyes of people with special care. Ruben is a genius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fingers are stained with magic, any paintings, words, sculptures, can be in their own home, they are perfectly copied, and with the real goods Hard to distinguish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only a few parts of the products sold in the market every year, mixed in the real thing, true and false, it is hard to detect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, Ruben has had trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recently faked a name called "The Feast". The famous paintings whose whereabouts are unknown are sold at a high price through their own trading houses. The buyer quickly found him again. "Hey, I spent 260,000, but you sold me a fake!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible. It must be that some self-righteous appraisers are talking about it." Ruben retorted that he was very confident in his craft. Even paints and canvases used special old methods to make this new The paintings are baked, and under any screening, they are antiques from a hundred years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buyer took out a newspaper, "The Royal Museum of the Portland, just published yesterday, announced that it had won a treasure, but two weeks ago, I I bought it from you. Why are there two "Feasts"? Should I believe in you, or do you believe in dozens of famous experts in the Royal Museum?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This damn foreign black market transaction! This damn Portuguese Museum! This damn, suddenly appeared in the market "feast"! It just killed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oops, it seems that I have to fire the appraiser responsible for the acquisition. I don't want you to say that I have lost it this time and paid for the quality." 200,000, also took the reputation of the transaction line." Ruben can only say, "I will return the money to you, is it cash or check?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Because of this, the business of the trading bank plummeted. Ruben started to turn around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are often forgery masters who only take the work in the field from the outsiders when they are new, and when they have money, they usually only accept old acquaintances selectively. Entrusted, working with strangers, the risk is too great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruben now needs money to maintain his expenses. He blew the wind on the road: Nigel began to return to the old line. As long as I have money, I will give it to you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he is staying in the office of the trading house, holding his chin with his hand and listening carefully to the needs of the customer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""A set of fingerprint molds?" Ruben Neger asked strangely. The idea of ​​fingerprinting was originally proposed by a person in the judicial circle of Byron 40 years ago. He believes that this is the most advantageous weapon for identifying the identity of criminals, but the circulation is not extensive, and there is no convenient testing equipment to perfect His point of view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." To answer him, is a very handsome young man, maroon smooth hair, eyes deep and inky, fingers long and clean, body The clothing is very valuable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruben knows the rules of doing business, never asks the customer’s name and purpose, he turns to the topic, "Then you can find the right person, but this is very lively Troublesome, so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Money is not a problem.” The guest replied, put a small suitcase on the table and open it, which is a stack of new tickets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two days." Ruben looked at the banknote greedily. "I need paper or cloth with original fingerprints, and up to 7%." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transaction was quickly settled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knock on the door. A good-looking trading bank secretary came in. She sneaked at Fulan and her face was red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Ben asked, "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss, a gentleman insisted on seeing You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a guest coming to work, his craft is simply a money machine. Ruben nodded. "Molly, you should send the gentleman out first. Then ask him to come in." He called the secretary's name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will come back two days later." Fran stood up after the transformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please come with me," said Secretary Molly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hallway, Fran passed a man wearing a turtleneck coat and a hat. When the shoulders touched, Fran suddenly felt a little chest. Bored, the holy force in the body instantly swayed, and immediately restored to calmness without stunned, it seems illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry." The man in the trench coat is slightly jaw-shaped. "Mr. Najer is at the office at the end of the corridor."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you go straight. Turn right. The first room is." Molly recognized, this man is the guest who was in the lobby and asked to see the boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the man disappearing at the corner. The secretary yelled, "Isn't it waiting for him to wait in the hall, it's rude, it's rude." She turned to Fran again, "you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Fran touched the necklace pendant under his chest clothes, which was left to him before William Mage left, and he could isolate the supernatural ability and hide his own inhuman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The man..." He realized the change in the body. This kind of sacred power is uncontrolled, as if it were attracted to the situation, once appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That happened on the samurai Matilda Herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., sir." Molly’s secretary repeatedly shouted for Fran to return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I see you standing still."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I was thinking about it, your business is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for complimenting." Li replied that she was not aware of the boss’s private activities and thought that the transaction business had begun to improve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can go out, you go to work." Fran smiled, his red lips and white smile, so Molly's face began to get hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His appearance and dress, must be an art-loving son. day. I have a fiancé, and I am getting married next year. Don't think about it, stay away from this dangerous playboy. Molly thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said incoherently, "Are you free tonight, I am going to work at six o'clock, maybe, I can introduce you to the town of Perast." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ruben Najer carefully poured into a small iron bucket filled with seaweed ash, poured sulfuric acid, and a triangular bracket was placed in the center of the iron bucket. He placed a large piece of thin rags supplied by the customer on the stand, waiting to incorporate the seaweed ash of sulphuric acid, and when the black and purple smoke rose, he tightened the lid of the bucket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh seaweed can be seen everywhere in the vegetable market, while sulfuric acid is going to the stationery store. People are used to adding a little sulfuric acid to the ink when using parchment. Make the writing clearer and easier to save. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of counterfeiting is very low, "I am eating a cooking rice." Ruben thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About two hours later, Ruben grabbed his nose, uncovered the lid, and waited for the smoky smoke to dissipate, and clipped the rag with a pair of tweezers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of faint purple-red fingerprints on the cloth. Ruben carefully discerns under the small focus light. According to experience, he recognizes the thumb, index finger and middle finger. shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fingerprint has been left for too long, not very clear. Fortunately, I am an expert, and I can't make it for others." Ruben proudly thought. He fixed the cloth under the lamp, scraped the body, carefully applied the sticky glue to the texture a little bit, and then used the soft brush to rub the iron ore powder to shake the powder evenly before the glue dries. On the fingerprint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unusual flexibility of the fingers and the high concentration of energy made Ruben go smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, use the magnet to absorb the excess iron ore fines. The rest is to make the finger-sized mud with clay and bake the fingerprints. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The counterfeiting expert was busy for two days. He completed two commissions and collapsed in a chair like a prostration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"4:1 in the morning." Ruben looked at the watch, looked at the still dark sky outside the window, struggling to stand up and decided to take a cool shower first. , eat something, sleep in the United States and the United States. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked straight to the bathroom, rubbed a few faces under the halter, and then opened the bathtub waiting for the copper basin to fill the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drowsiness makes Ruben's eyelids fight straight, "earn 70,000." He calculated his income and yawned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Nigel, are you busy?" Ruben suddenly heard someone ask himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Busy is over." He replied casually, then jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My time is very tight, so I don't want to visit, please don't be surprised." The gentleman said with a gentle and elegant, as if he was an invited guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon, the police officers of the Perast Police Station received a report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
