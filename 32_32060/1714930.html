			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sun, the cracked rocks are pale in color, and the bright yellow moss grows in the labyrinth of the crack, in the leeward, There are also a lot of rubbish that has not been blown away by the sea breeze, the waves and the wind, which invade the ground of the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The island is not large. Strictly speaking, this is just a slightly larger coral reef. Just a few steps, Fran came to the Master Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole tower is about three stories high, and the red bricks on the exterior are corroded by the unique alkali of the seawater, and occasionally a wind blows through the weathered gravel. From the cracks in the bricks, although this is the first time Fran has seen the Master Tower, he is sure that this and the rumors are carved with Mithril and gems, guarded by countless konjac and alien creatures. The residence of the Master is very different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me, is Mr. William at home?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling a few times in front of the door, quiet Quietly, in the ear, only the waves beat the sound of the reef. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After careful observation, Fran felt that the wooden door was not a magic trap for imagining human life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed carefully, unexpectedly, the door was unlocked, accompanied by the increasing strength of the wrist, the decaying door "吱嘎吱嘎" The ground rubbed a harsh sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior is dimly lit, the small windows on the walls are pulled thick curtains, and the sun is hard to break in from the gap between the curtains and the window sills. It seems that it hasn't been for a long time. The person cleaned, and the old scale was hoarded on the old floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people who live here are really lazy things." It is estimated that the first time visitors will have such a thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire first floor lobby is empty, but there is a narrow staircase rising upwards in the middle of the room. Fran tries to walk up, and the steps made of wood are immediately unbearable. The heavy burden of picking up, let Fran doubt whether it can afford his weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every step, the body rises and falls with the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staying in such a high-risk building really needs a little courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still no one on the second floor, a small bed at the corner, a greasy oak table, and tableware stacked on the table with leftovers left, indicating that this is The owner's bedroom and dining room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of clothes were scattered on the floor, especially the pointed hat. Fran picked it up and looked at it carefully. The style and the clown of the circus The funny caps worn are very similar, but the colors are not colorful but dark and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary magician wears this hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there finally someone coming?" When Fran’s strange owner went there, it seemed to answer his doubts, the hoarse voice from the top third floor Passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is Mr. William? I am Fran Fryer, assistant prosecutor in the first court."<br /><br />&nbsp; & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, I will control who you are, as long as you are alive, hurry up to the top floor, hey, I am already crazy." The voice immediately sharpened, and the tone was filled with excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. William, the first court needs your help, and I look forward to your visit. Maybe the trivial things in the world are not as good as exploring the vast magical world, but Every employee in the first court and the citizens of Feidu will be deeply grateful to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is still standing still, he has made up his mind Leave the words and leave immediately. The words "living people" and "quickly mad" made him deeply worried. Is the master ready to use ** experiments to pursue breakthroughs in the field of magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Need my help? God, who will help me before that?" The magician complained a few words and then suddenly realized, " Please don't be afraid, although the rumored Master is a group of perverts who like to use other people's lives to verify the effects of spells, but I promise that the human body is the most inferior experimental carrier, I would rather summon a little ghost to achieve my own Purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My experiment has a little trouble and needs the help of another person. Please be assured that this will not cause any harm to you. Instead, It will be a rare experience for ordinary people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before you come up, trouble to open the cabinet, there is a little food inside, please give it to me, damn, I can't open it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With uneasy In the mood, Fran took out the rye bread that had been put hard in the cupboard and walked toward the top floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two turns of the spiral staircase, the top floor was in front of Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the following is ruined like a temporary home for a tramp, the top floor is like another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of the ten large tables, countless glassware piled up together, some filled with red, green and green liquids, some with copper Yellow powder, and some bottles are even the tail of a gecko-like creature or the feathers of some kind of bird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curved glass tube joins the flask, beaker, tube, funnel, and crucible into a group, and the groups are connected to each other in a large group. It seems that the experiment stopped in a very hasty situation, and the slag filtered on the funnel filter had not been cleaned up. The piece was made of metal and engraved with a mysterious symbol on the side. It seemed to be a heater device that used up all the fuel. Let a large group of jelly-like things in the shabu-shabu solidify into a block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious atmosphere fills the room, but there is a bit of ruinous atmosphere. Fran’s prominent place in the desk and wall closet is the sign of the first court. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I only stayed in the first court for two months, Fran still heard a lot of interesting whispers, "the furniture that is not seen for no reason" is one of them. The hand-made tables and chairs that are specially ordered from famous brands, the bookshelf made of wood, often in a late night, like the ice under the strong sun, disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This led to a significant increase in spending on the equipment for the first court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards swear that they are not lazy patrols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the whimsy of "furniture-attached furniture" gradually spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran wanted, "I found the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obviously the master’s As a result, however, how does a large-sized desk cabinet pass through the guard's eyes and be carried to a small island in the sea? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumably this is also the magic of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have never visited a guest here, almost thinking that I will be trapped in this form for a lifetime." The magician sighed happily and said, "Please put Bread gives me, hunger is a painful experience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound came from under the feet, when Fran asked for the past, on the floor In a large stack of books, there is a powerless lying on a mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grey fluffy, sly beard, mung bean-like sneaky eyes, bare reddish long tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real price is a gray hair mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran was a little bit flustered when he put the food next to the mouse, and the mouse that seemed to be hungry for a long time immediately swallowed up, as if it was not overdue bread but was filled Full of fat and fat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s so delicious, I never knew that the bread would be so delicious.” The mouse swallowed the last bit of the scum into the stomach, sighed with satisfaction, and mung bean-like The size of the eyes is comfortably smashed into a slit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mouse reveals such anthropomorphic expression and can spit out words. Fran felt that the whole world was not real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really don't know how to express my gratitude. Now, please help me write "human hair" in the third box and "Phosphorus" in the sixth box. "Stone", and the seventh drawer with the "Bone Powder" label open, take out some one to one ratio and put it in the 'Jelly' pot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Seeing Fran some hesitation, the mouse explained, "Please believe that I am the William you are looking for, the first court honorary magician, because of some mistakes, I am trapped in this damn form." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to restore the original state, you must refine an ointment, but I can't do it with this form, even the closet drawers are not enough." The teacher's mouse said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, after putting the material into the crucible, take the bottle filled with black liquid on the table and pour the liquid into the crucible. Heater." After seeing Fran in accordance with the instructions, the magician pointed out, "Don't ignite the fire directly, it will explode. You can find the powder on another table, it can suppress the fire oil, and Will not let the temperature of the flame lower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the preparations were completed, Fran ignited the heater, and the white tongue suddenly came out. Soon, the jelly solidified in the crucible was bubbly big and small, and it rolled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell is very smelly, like the fertilizer in the field, Fran is forced to vomit, and under the guidance of the magician, put it in the pot Into a piece of stardust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very skilled, not like a newbie?" The magician squinted his head and asked strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will also conduct some experiments in herbal medicine, private hobbies," Fran answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, herbalism." The magician’s face appeared with a look of disappointment. "But it’s no wonder, in the eyes of ordinary people, that’s already counted. A profound knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the placement of the stars, the turbid liquid in the sputum gradually formed two distinct parts, below It is a gray scum that floats on top of a layer of transparent mucus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Now filter the slag with a strainer, and then wait for the first half hour, after the mucus condenses into a blue-green ointment, I can restore the original shape. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. William, what experiment are you doing? You can turn yourself into a mouse." Fran asked, curiously, while filtering. "Is this the legendary metamorphosis? It's amazing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you really don't know the goods, you actually said that this great achievement is metamorphosis. After all, it’s an ordinary person. If it’s another magician, I’m so surprised that my eyes are flying out.” The magician’s tone is full of pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is a little confused. "Although I have not touched the mystery of the magic world before, in the rumor, the deformation is not to become any animal." "Well?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Transformation is just a second-level spell that any wizard can use to remove magic, and can only change the appearance." Explain, "Have you heard of Druid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have heard in the propaganda of the Holy See that it is a group of self-proclaimed beasts. The pagans, it is said that they even have the same aesthetics as the beasts, and even mate with the beasts to breed offspring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, let's mention the damn Holy See. What do the bishops do in addition to rumors?" The magician said in an unfair manner, "Anyone is a pagan in their eyes, and even the wizard summons a little monster." It will be said to be dedicated to the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Druid's natural spells are not worth mentioning in the eyes of the Master, but their deformation It is impossible for the Master to be a Master. A Druid elder can even change into a dragon, and retain the skills that only the real dragon can perform, such as Spit, Longwei. The Oak Road still has its own unique features." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For ten years I have been imitating Druid's talents in an attempt to create a truly powerful transformation, and my research finally broke through earlier. Although it can only become a weak creature such as a mouse or a cockroach, it can't be disfigured even if it is the true eye of the holy warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it’s almost I have hurt myself, when I found out that I have been able to When the spell mimics some of the techniques of low-level Druid deformation, I can't wait to cast the spell. Then, as expected, I become a mouse, a real mouse, agile running, better than human hearing and shimmer "Visual sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I ran wildly in the tower, completely understanding the world with the mouse's perception, and when I was exhausted, I wanted to regain my human body before I regret it. I found that I forgot to pre-distribute the medium needed for the restoration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please accept my thanks again, if it is not for you to come in time, I guess I only I can live by eucalyptus wood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a smile on the corner of the magician’s mouth, but in Fran’s opinion, a mouse that laughs like a human, let People are a little creepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Fran, you have won the friendship of a magician, but want to maintain this friendship, please don’t tell others what you see today. My research will only come in handy if it can become a powerful creature such as a Tauren or a lion. Otherwise I will be laughed at as a geek who spent ten years studying how to become a mouse."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, please trust the mouth of a prosecutor," Fran said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transparent mucus in the sputum has cooled down, showing a lustrous scent, and the original disgusting scent is also transformed into a faint fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
