			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Heavily caught a cold and low fever, let the head of Barry Silana sleep for a few days, when she just opened her eyes, she saw Nicole anxious face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heaven, I slept for three days, how much wine did you drink at the time, and made yourself a ghost?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...how?" She touched her forehead, panicked, and did not remember what happened. The last memory was that she was drunk and fell asleep at the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you are finished, you fall in love and go crazy. On the night of the town just three days ago, you were drunk and still walked around in a sleepwalking style. Ten miles of road, and finally slumbering all night long by the road." Nicole said with a worried heart, "It rained and burned." "Sorry... how come I come back?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Whiteman happened to be at the border, and found you when passing by, otherwise we have to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Labetta? After leaving Tantin, Barry thought about it and felt that the urgency of her feelings at the beginning was completely tempted by Lauvita. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she is holding on to her point, if she can be more patient, maybe the result is completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She may have been fooled, and this is a friend who is a boudoir, actually a woman who is a rival. But Barry can't get evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really want to thank her." Barry said with self-deprecation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister Selana, are we not going to have a good handkerchief? Don't you see it." The door opened and Lauvita Whiteman came in. Cecilia was pale, her lips were purple, and she was crisp behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it better? The relationship is better, I can't be sure, I will be pulled by you." The more I look at Lauvita's face, the more I feel dark. Annoyed, she glimpsed the probe of Cecilia, so she waved her hand, "Taro, come to Auntie here." The girl shook her head and fled to hide behind Lavetta. She was afraid that Aunt Barrie would see the scars of her own horror. Under the cotton clothes, there is a thick bandage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You wake up just right, I am going to discuss things with you." The gray girl looked at the head and reached out and held Cecilia in her arms. "I like this child very much and want to adopt her as a foster girl."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole, who is holding a cup of tea, squirts out a sip of water. "Now a woman? How old are you. Don't you be born?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Love has nothing to do with age." Lauvita said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We all like Cecilia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a favorite The problem, the troupe's rushing life is not suitable for a young girl who is still young. She should be happier, have a doll, have silk sheets, and receive various formal education."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You mean, we abused her? Didn't give her delicious food? Didn't make her happy?" Nicole, who was tempered, replied loudly. "And, the troupe is quite democratic, and we respect individual wishes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not believe you ask her. May not want to leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She believes that Little Girl is willing to stay in the troupe of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc girl secretly squinted at the head. Whispered, "I... I want to live with my sister Lauetta. You have to be tired this morning. And, I am not a private property of the troupe, I can freely choose to stay or leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dangdang..." The cup slipped from Nicole's hand and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barui stared at the timid Cecilia, her eyes gradually reddened, and she suddenly smiled in dismay. "Let's go, go and leave." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s still a good thing for Sylvia." Lauvita said that the tone was full of gratitude, but there was a mockery in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...this woman. Not only did it destroy my love, but I didn't know what magic I used, and I took away the girl I thought was half a daughter. Barry finally realized that, for her, Lauvita is completely like a cat and a mouse, a donkey and a snake, unable to coexist, a natural enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lauvita thought, "If it wasn’t for an accident, your slut was punished early. This is a cheaper time for you." Inadvertently collided, the air seems to have a sizzling, scalp and numb electric flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving the troupe, Cecilia grinned and tried not to let the tears flow out. "So, will the aunts and sisters be safe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know the horror of the monster. If you stay in the troupe, it will lead to disaster sooner or later. Moreover, poor Marty has not found a fate now, so we must be strong and avenge your Matilda sister." The little girl clenched her fists, and there was sadness in her eyes, and the haze that should not have appeared in her age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An Coleon, through the mouth of Cecilia, I know the name and detailed information of your devil's land." My heart murmurs, "I will always find the opportunity, cut your claws, unplug your teeth, and ask you to beg."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is satisfied Cecilia, "Lost the samurai, now, got a good helper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This works 16k novel network exclusive text version starting, not It is not allowed to reprint, extract, and more recent and fastest chapters, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of day and night, the law exercises its rights tirelessly. It protects the protection and punishes the punishment. This is not about good and evil. It only represents an insurmountable scale. If you cross the border, you will be punished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tantin’s trial of small cases and dispute resolution night courts is much cleaner than other cities, at least the mats on the seats have no musty. There was no mottled paint on the wall. Tonight, the judge was a thin, middle-aged man in his forties. He was tired and his eyes were covered with red blood. He opened his face and sneaked a yawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night court did not have a prosecutor, everything was quickly decided by the judge himself, and he had to go fast, and every night there was a variety of cases flooding like a tide, releasing The sentence of fines or imprisonment must be decided in a short period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The crime of fighting, a fine of one hundred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Lord Judge, I have no money "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is three months in prison, well, next,."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clerk handed the document recording the case to the judge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have pronounced that the defendant has been serving hard labor for six weeks because of the sale of a small amount of illegal drugs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 20 people can only sit alone in a few seats They are all family members or relatives of the judges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Fryer is sitting quietly in the corner of the last row of the auditorium, he pinches his hat with a slightly curled hat, black The silver-plated cane was placed across the knee, slightly closed, as if listening, and seemed to fall asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the verdict, confessing the crime, the sound of the hammer hitting the tabletop is more than the volt, the bailiff carries a famous prisoner. Or unravel the handcuffs, release them in court, or declare jail, and go directly to the prisoner outside the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noisy, jealousy, and a little majesty in the night court, making Fran very peaceful, compared to the night, the bright lights, here for him Words. It is a paradise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most common night courts are more fair than aristocratic courts or higher commercial courts. There is no political bargaining, no intrigue, and more style. Uncommon large courts, ruthless officials, and newspapers and magazines rushing to report, sometimes biased by the media's excessive attention, here is closer to the true meaning of the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbiased. No compromises. Fair and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used them as a catalyst for a dream, a consolation of a scar in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown, he exists. Let the judge feel flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is the last row of the gentleman." With the gap between the two cases, the judge whispered to the clerk, "Look at the clothes, not the The person who goes to the night court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it the official in charge of the assessment work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bailiff who came to the new prisoner, heard their conversation, looked at Fran carefully, smiled and said, "It turned out to be the gentleman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I know, but I have seen it several times, every other time. Then the gentleman came to the night court, all sitting in the corner. The location is as if it is a place to rest until you close the court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quiet people, devout believers, it is not uncommon to attend the mass every week." But I have not heard that some people came to the court on time to participate in the morning prayers." The judge said. "But there is no law that does not allow the public to listen, and I can't control it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I want to see who is lucky tonight." go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lucky?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gentleman, every time he comes to court, he will help The crime is slightly fine for the prisoner to pay the fine and the fine, completely random, and only one person at a time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is difficult to understand." The judge spread his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prisoner who was brought up to wait for the trial just heard the conversation clearly. He didn’t know the truth, twisted his neck and shouted loudly at Fran. You, are you rumored to be a 'priest' in the mainland? I have heard of you, come help me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge did not care about the prisoner’s jealousy, anyway night The court could not maintain a particularly rigorous order. He curiously asked, "Priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, this is the nickname, I heard from friends, there are Mr. Wei Hao always came here to help us these bitter men. Last time, the old Betty of Fengyue Street, because of the tax payment, was caught by the guys in your uniform, and was fined three times, that is, the pastor helped her pay. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three times the penalty tax, this is stipulated by law." The judge said that he looked at the so-called pastor, the other party did not hear it, No response, so I started the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blackmail, half-year hard labor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What shit priest, since you helped others Why don't you come to help me!" The prisoner cursed in disappointment and spit on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge has been guessing who the lucky one is. He regards this as a rare adjustment tonight. When judging a young niece with beautiful blue eyes, he thought, "Do not help men, probably want to help pretty girls." "But until the end of the verdict, the man did not move. When he tried to judge an old liar who committed fraud, the person was not interested in helping the elderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night was deep, and when the piled up cases were swept away, the man sat still in peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge suspected that the other person was really asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took off some dirty horse wigs, this kind of judicial-specific wig is expensive, not a night court judge can afford it by salary, this The top wig was issued by the General Court when he was sworn in. After more than ten years, the hair of many places fell off, revealing the bare bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge stood up from the seat, licked the sore waist, closed the court time, except for him, only the strange Mr. Shou. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, you have to leave." He was just about to wake up the other hand, and the hand had not touched it. The man opened his eyes. This is a blind eye. A deep, big man with a strange look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you a judge for a few years?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh... twelve years." He answered subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a total of forty-eight cases tonight. You didn't ask for a reminder. You didn't check the contents of the regulations. You are completely versed in the proficiency of the Code. A wonderfully fascinating sense of rhythm. The most pleasing thing is that forty-eight judgments, no mistakes at all. Even some obscure laws have noticed. The smaller the case, the more involved The more articles there are, the same crime of theft, according to the way of committing crimes, the amount of theft, the amount of money repaid and the judicial interpretation, there can be no less than twelve kinds of penalties, although the difference is small. But you did not let the prisoners The prison stayed up for one night and did not ask them to take a day off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have won the prize." The judge did not know why the other party said this. However, he heard that this person has a lot of research on the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are qualified to be the presiding judge of a formal court, regardless of qualifications or experience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;“I am a self-taught student. I don’t have a law school diploma in the court where I am a writer. In Tantin, the level of the diploma usually determines the future.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why don't you take the test."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least temporarily suspended for a year, if I don't work, what do family members eat?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's okay." The man took out a gold pen and wrote a string on an anonymous check. "This will save the average family for a year and a half. The right person should sit. In the right place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge has been wondering who is the lucky one today. He didn't expect to be himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...but..." He worked for twelve years and worked diligently, from a small clerk to a night court acting judge. I thought that this life's position is over, but tonight, this man who has been smoothed by the reality, has for the first time believed that there is a miracle in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't refuse, I am very grateful, you made me have a good night's dream." Fran whispered, he put the check into the judge's hand, wearing Put on the hat and go out outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dream is over." He sighed. "Now. I have to go back to reality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The judge held the ticket and spent a long time. When he remembered and did not ask the name of the benefactor, he hurriedly chased it out. The night was deep and the moon was bleak. He only saw that the tall and burly, but inexplicably looked a bit backward. Gradually disappeared at the end of the street where the street lights could not shine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I arrived at my home, Fran saw a car with a black lacquered carriage on the carriage. In front of the door, the young man Moore was silently looking around with a vigilant gaze, and saw him from afar, and immediately jumped off the seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Herald Knight, is a secret letter from Miss Whitemane, can't be delayed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Advanced to have a drink, I have read the letter and then decide whether to assign a new task."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good land."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content is written by a complicated communication password. On the surface, it is an ordinary correspondence. Only by picking out the letters of the first few rows of the specific lines and re-splicing the sentences, can we understand the true meaning of the letterhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even if you lose or fall into the hands of others, you won’t be found secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran let Moore take it easy, then sit at the table, use a paper cutter to open the kraft paper seal and pull out the letter inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This communication password has several formats, each time it is different, and only the operator and Lauvita know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first seven digits of the first line are mouths, the third type of format, using the reverse spelling method..." Fran looks at the side while interpreting the secret letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, sometimes I always have the illusion that you are very similar to the godfather." Moore took a bottle of wine from the closet, "all the same "People, think deeply and go on." "You mean Mr. Van Graham." Fran said his own name of another incarnation. "So I am intimate with him and trust each other."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like me, I don’t know how to learn more, maybe it’s a small thing, but when it comes to big things, it’s confusing.” Moore poured wine, “The kind of control, The feeling of knowing everything must be wonderful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can there be such a person." Fran answered, "Only a fool will think that he can Everyone counts, and believes that others will go step by step through the path he has arranged. This kind of thing can not be done even if the gods of the past and the future can be thoroughly understood."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“呀?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“People are the most complex species in the world, even if they are close friends, they can’t really Through his heart, no matter how much tricks and strategies, no one can be perfect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called "being a person, doing things in the sky", just like Fran The attempt to provoke the civil strife of the gorse is based on the existing contradictions. By analyzing the individuality of each person, even if it does not happen now, but after three or five years, the battle will definitely be staged. They are exposed early in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just pushed a handful of maliciously behind him, but what happens in the future, what kind of situation will happen, then only genius will know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore seems to understand and nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan stared at the translated secret letter, the corner of the mouth, and the palm of the hand unconsciously clenched into a fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened in the South in the near future, through the words, appeared in front of Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Warrior has recovered his reason and is missing. Although it is troublesome, it is nothing. As long as it is arranged in advance, the harm can be minimized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia is also a dragon, and is a former enemy, knowing a lot about the inside of the shadow king. But she did not participate in the case of the door, Fran would not be unreasonably resentful. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal Troupe re-entered the road after the retreat of Barry, estimated the distance, and now has arrived at the southern border to the holy city of Anno. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan stopped his eyes at the end, and he felt that his breathing was a little short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An Mei...the younger sister of Shadow King, the highest-end dragon pulse assassin in the underground world?" He repeatedly recited in his heart, "Hey, they brainwashed you? Lost I remembered the old memories? But I am not angry. I just feel that the hanging heart suddenly stabilizes a lot. You are fine, no one can hurt you casually. It’s great. No matter what you look like, you belong to me. An Mei, my most cherished wife, the only woman in my life who really loved the joyful woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to drink too?" He held a bottle and prepared to have another drink. But he suddenly saw that he had always been calm and thoughtful, as if he did not care, the lord of the Knights of Kasimodo, the singer and the eyes, shed a flustered and urgent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are two things, one, now I will give you all the affairs of the construction line." Fran used a gloomy and imperative tone to Mu Said, "If you feel powerless, you can slow down the progress appropriately, but remember to do the confidential work until you come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Waiting for you to come back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the second thing, I will set off immediately and go to the south to handle some things. Externally, you can say that I am going to talk about a big deal. Business, but don't leak specific whereabouts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
