			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Ruth holding a large paper bag and using her shoulders to open the hall door of the apartment building, "Hey, rose, pick up the handle." Her face was slightly braved Khan, "I just bought a bunch of ham and eggs, and rye bread."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already introduced myself, please call me Ms. Luo Jidian Peggy is playing with the pot and the stove in the common kitchen. There is no royal chef here, nor a big restaurant with ordering service. If you want to eat, you have to do it yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, cooking can't be done overnight, Missy can taste the vintage and good or bad of the wine with her tongue, but she doesn't know how to bring it with astringency. The meat and the vegetables sticking to the wet mud turn into delicious and delicious dishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple kitchenware is a very strange thing for Peggy, but smart people learn anything fast, after two rounds in the kitchen, she probably Master the use of various pots and pans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the walls and stoves of the communal kitchen are covered with yellowish dirt, Peggy is fed up with the days of breading every day, and there are few private restaurants in the town. The black smoke is suffocating, and Lilian also needs sufficient nutrients to restore strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to eat?" Ruth licked her nose and leaned in. The inferior perfume smell mixed with the not too good fume, making Peggy wrinkle Eyebrows, she turned coldly and turned to stir the soup in the hanging pot, and turned the meat that was being fried on the stove, and added it to the plate. The posture was very skilled and lived like a superb chef. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven’t seen pigs have eaten pork. The old chefs used to have such a sizzling taste when cooking, and Missy tried to imitate those movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I tasted it." Ruth looked over curiously and grabbed a small piece with a fingernail with red nail polish. "It's a bit sloppy." Blowing hot air and throwing it into your mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy stared at the girl, she was stunned, she had never seen such a vulgar mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruth was equally shocked. She bitterly spits out a few chews of food. "What dish do you cook?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mamlok royal cuisine, secret mushrooms, fried lamb leg meat." Missy answered with a sigh of relief. This dish was once enjoyed in the Queen's Restaurant in Tantin, and she was invited to explain the cooking process and ingredients. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was out of a moment of interest, I did not expect that one day will come in handy, but fortunately, or Peggy would not know how to fry the poached eggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mushroom sauce? Lamb leg meat? It sounds expensive, but," Ruth was very suspicious. "Are you sure that it is not a pig feed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little niece sighed. "Some days, you and your sister, eat this kind of thing?" She wiped it with a rag. I wiped my hand and occupied the position of the stove. I cut the ham and bread quickly with a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help you make two sandwiches with omelettes, Heaven, royal cuisine?” Ruth laughed and shook her head, feeling overwhelmed by the name of this special mouthful. “This is the most unpalatable thing I have ever tasted. I can disgust my stomach.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy feels angry at a female monkey. It’s really boring, “That’s working, thanks. I’m paying you five dollars.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We’re good sisters, you’re welcome.” Ruth smiles . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five dollars." Missy insisted that in order not to be too special, Peggy has always hidden her inner disdain, trying to pretend to be a kind and ordinary. Woman, but now it seems that she makes the monkeys too arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The despicable guy actually dared to pray for her friendship, mutual sister? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile disappeared from the girl’s face, and she smacked the meat and made the oak table squeaky. "Ten dollars, because I am doing two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Peggy walked outside, "Remember to come to my room." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruth shouted in the back, "Rose, close the kitchen door, the fumes will affect others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to her is the loud crash of the door and the door frame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salesman Dawson is still immersed in ecstasy, he is drunk and smoked from the frequent tavern, the day before yesterday The pile business is a gift from heaven. Dawson personally inquired about several peers who are proficient in jewelry craftsmanship, that ring can sell an astronomical number! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, man, 150,000, I will open the check immediately." Someone asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Dawson has a brighter idea, a small place can’t sell for a good price, he is going to get it in a big city for sale, then 200,000 It is possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the country girl of unknown origin, he is ready to go again, maybe there will be even more surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to those who know how to keep the tone, he only revealed to the mistress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Baby, I will buy you a set of jewellery, plus a blue fox fur collar." Dawson promised to show off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are awesome." The mistress was happily wrapped around him in the bed and almost swayed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, someone took a picture on Dawson’s shoulder, then an arm pulled him unreasonably and dragged him into a nearby black hole. In the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in the depths of the alley, there was a scream of pigs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byron has a saying: Big mouth is the key to the door of disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninger is an ugly man with a cocky nose and a slap in the face. He is the squad leader of the town police station. He is harsh and greedy, as long as he hears any money. The sound of the wind, all trying to get a share of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what a beautiful little thing." He stared at the beautiful ring in his palm. "I heard that you picked up a big bargain. It seems that you are not imaginary." "Man, where did you get it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawson snorted and gasped, his blood straight down his cheeks, his face bruised, his nose Was beaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be that scorpion has a sigh of relief! The salesman regretted that his mistress was a frivolous woman with watery poppies. She did not expect to have a leg with Ninge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can make him miserable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you say? I am very kind, otherwise you can be sent to court in accordance with your private activities, and then sentenced to several years in prison." Ning Ge chewed the tooth flower and signaled the accomplices to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businessman laboriously opened the swollen eyelids, and through the bloody slits, he saw two policemen with mixed gas and began to raise the batons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ning... Mr. Ninge, you broke the rules." He groaned and suffered from severe pain, and seemed to have broken a few bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Rules? Which law says that agents must abide by the rules of the underworld?" Ninge laughed and raised his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally surrendered, and life is more important than the ticket. "It’s a beautiful country girl who sold it to me, she lives..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛丽安 has recovered to wake up the next morning, the wounds have recovered under the medicinal and powerful recovery, and it is estimated that after two days of rest, they can barely get out of bed. walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of continuing to escape on the road was mentioned on the agenda. "The local police station is not an obstacle. The Crown Prince has committed a felony of rebellion. Compared to us, For the sake of the face, the royal family is even more afraid of the troubles of the city, everyone knows." Yan Lian said weakly, "so all night, cloth, arrest, and even future trials are secret, which led to his manpower. It’s certainly not enough to search the entire Gulf area in full.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy stares at the map and draws a few lines with a pen. “The sea is not working, it can only be left by road. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The traffic must have a secret prince of the prince, waiting for you to vote for the net." Lilian has another thought, "We can stand still, Laughing, waiting for the family reinforcements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do know the family's private intelligence channels in the Gulf, it is not difficult to contact them."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy said categorically, "But I can’t put hope next to it. The only thing that can be relied on is you and myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a footstep in the corridor, parked in front of the door, and Julian swept the eye door. Stopped talking. "It’s the girl next door." She whispered that the little maid’s ears were amazing, and it’s not difficult to detect her identity from the intensity of the pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the person shouted, "Rose, come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This self-cooked female monkey! Peggy squeezed her fist and she got up and opened the door, glaring at the unwelcome welcoming neighbors... and two bowls of fish and chopped soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruth squeezed the large plate of the bowl and squeezed in. Hey, "It’s ten o’clock, but I didn’t see you going downstairs to have breakfast. Don't you have to cook, do you have to starve?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to eat." Peggy refused bluntly, but the flavor of the fish soup made her The sputum of the stomach is only concentrating on the future itinerary. I don’t feel hungry. Now I am a little slack, and the hunger is rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be reluctant, rose." Ruth snorted smugly, put the plate on the table, and waved her hand, "Hot eat, aging mother's craft You can even have a food and beverage stall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss, I’m going crazy, rose? rose,! What a disgusting nickname, she finally couldn't help but scream, "Don't call me a rose,!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Rogi Tianna, then you Don't mention the money in the future.” Ruth shrugged and yawned and yawned. “I went back to sleep, and it was really tired to get up. After I finished eating, I remember to take the tray to the kitchen. This is common.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛丽安佩服服命命, the other party actually took the ice-cool hostess in three or two times, provocatively unable to control the emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When is it so familiar with her?" After Ruth went out, the little maid asked Peggy with emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t tell me like a monkey who lives in a group." Missy hated and said, holding the bowl, "It’s a tribute to the monkey. Let's eat, her cooking is at least better than mine.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You cook in person!” Julian’s eyes were round and whispered. "No wonder, when I was confused, I was filled with a lot of things. It was very disgusting. It was not a medicine, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You become relieved Peggy is very unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛丽安眯眯笑眯眯不说言, her Missy is such a person, resisting the friendship that others have actively offered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
