			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Time is very fast, summer is coming to an end, autumn is silent, and silently leaves with leaves, like a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light and darkness, there are always many unknown things happening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, one day, a plot in a room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe Corleone woke up in his dreams and looked sideways, sitting on a chair in the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously summoned the shadows, and never left the smashed dagger to slip the palm of his hand from the sleeve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the shadow just began to respond to the call, and it was suppressed by the invisible intention. For a moment, the shadow of the suffocating human being, in a small room, desperately danced, depicting Roughly corrugated, then weak and soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two seconds later, he breathed a sigh of relief and could come silently into the room, ignoring the door lock and the small trap on the floor, and only the younger sister. Ann Corleone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did the lady express her attitude?" Joe put on his clothes and jumped out of bed with bare feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Coleon's green eyelids glittered in the darkness, and she lazily held her chin and looked at her brother's anxious look." Let's fight," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really good news." Joe snapped his finger. "Allegiance to us, agree with the dragon of our philosophy, much more than Andre." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the power of the guy is not to be underestimated. Except for the Dragons, ordinary gang members listen to him."<br /><br />&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "As long as he dies, everything is simple." Joe said, "The only thing I worry about is Wei Wener. The power of that little thing is not weak. It is Andrei's death loyalty." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will deal with it." An Leng said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The king is really good for the king." Joe haha ​​laughed. "If you can get that person now, the two kings help me, then Insurance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You found the dragon's dragon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but God knows what the patrol hall of Feidu has done, a big search, I sent it. The person who followed the track just got into the city, because the criminal record was caught." Joe was very annoyed. "Now I lost his track."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like me to find it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't separate, just as you said, start the war." Joe said, "The big rounds of the Round Table Council are not willing to see the violent turmoil in the underground world, but the new crown will always be covered with blood." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since fate created him and gave him mysterious power, then success or failure. He has to leave something in the torrent of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black road leader? No, that still can't satisfy Joe's fanatic heart. Perhaps one day, the Dragon Mairs will be like the new gods, be awe-inspiring by mortals, worshipped by mortals, and establish a magnificent palace in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He often sees this scene in his dreams, and the magnificent picture of that scene always makes him tremble and wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mattida is hungry. She swallowed. I started to imagine the taste of stewed mushrooms and grilled meat, but imagined it would only make her hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t know how many days have passed in the wilderness. At first, I can always find beautiful sweet fruits in the shrubs, but the days are getting colder and the fruits are no longer found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a crowded place, she huddled in the corner, there are always some kind people, who have left the leftovers and soup, even wrapped around them. The blanket was also given to her by a very kind mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a thin blanket can't resist the colder and colder weather, and finally there is a night. Snowing. Matida was frozen and straight, she called a good friend, but the pale flame, there is no trace of heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medida feels more and more sleepy, her eyelids are adorned with heavy things, squatting, she seems to see Dad’s face and touch her big hair There are warm nests and steaming meals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is in the snow and in the night. Fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage that Zallfa Lunge rented stopped. No matter how much he paid, the coachman refused to continue driving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., when walking in the snow, it is easy to break the horse's leg, it may not be anything to you, but I will no longer support the old and small livelihood." Said, "There are two blankets in the carriage. We have lived together for a night, and we will send you to the destination tomorrow morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forget it." Get off, he is ready to go to the special song city. There was a victim there, and he had to rush to ask for a statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone thinks that Zall Law Lonchi is crazy, for a wanted man to stay in Golden Horn Bay for half a year, no salary, no one to help, No future. But he is like a curse, desperately searching for all the clues of the prisoner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least 20 fraud cases, the same as the kidnapping case of Feidu, maybe earlier, the bank called Deborah The family work is also related to this.” Zall Law thought as he walked. “Good guy, he hasn’t left in Golden Horn Bay, but no one believes that the cases are all done by a group of people, but when I catch them, Everything can come to the fore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At dawn, the snow stopped, and Zall Law approached the Tege City, his shoes filled with water, toes Almost without consciousness, after asking the local cleaners to get up early, Zall Law is going to find a hotel to have breakfast, and take hot water in the basin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the alley of the forked street, Zall Law saw a large group of snow shaking slightly, under the white snow, revealing half of the shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped and was about to leave, but after two steps, he turned back. It is awkward to sweep the snow by hand. It is not very old, and it is hot and hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't take care of you, at eight in the morning, I have to get to the victim's home." Zall said, he just straightened up, but he heard 乞丐Weakly shouted, "Dad..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zolf seems to have seen his childhood, it was a gray memory, when he vowed to get ahead. No one can look down on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously touched his sly hair, and his nephew was confused, like a small animal that felt warm, and leaned his head against Zall's palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe I should find an assistant, there is a free one." Zall said, "I am not a soft heart, good heart can not be a good secret." The police."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cleaner who is sweeping the snow, I saw the road just now, the middle-aged man with a gloomy face appeared again, holding a dirty body in his arms. Hey, he shouted at him, "Is there a doctor near here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt , more recent and fastest chapters, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"**, the fire of the human heart, the power of mankind, the soul of mankind's original sin." Fran felt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I don’t understand you," said Kregan. "I only know that there is no Caesar in the sky, but there are always people who believe this." "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luovita is elegantly cutting the foie gras, she loves the smooth and refreshing taste, then calls the waiter and opens the bottle again." The bloody Mary of the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Miss." The waiter said respectfully, sneaked at the girl, and he shouted in his heart, "What a beautiful person." Rent at the hotel. Three sets of emperor suites, tipping is generous, from the manager to the small staff, all guessing, maybe a noble family came to the hotel. When the Lord should be the handsome young man with elegant manners, and the beauty is his wife, but also the housekeeper and bodyguard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past six months, the Fran fraud group has gained a lot, from officials to the rich, and one has not fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always cleverly uses the weaknesses of the other side, even if they are deceived, they dare not sing, for fear of reporting the case, their previous work, the black gold was found . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan needs money. If you want revenge, people who have Jinshan backing are better than a poor and poor white. Sometimes at night, he always thinks that he has fallen.
