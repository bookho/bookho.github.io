			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.When Fran-Flair came down from the carriage, the front of the Weber’s Grand Theatre was overcrowded, and at least ten people in the square wore white sleeves. The set of patrolmen was instructing the parking of the vehicle. "We are late, and there are no gaps," he said to Lauvita. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The park is on the side of the road, let's walk in." The girl dressed in a evening dress suitable for socializing, in order to cover up the crimson hickey on the neck, deliberately added The lapel shawl and the necklace of the chest rosary are faintly glowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stretched out her right hand with thin woolen gloves, and Fran hesitated, took her hand according to traditional etiquette, and helped the girl out of the carriage. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theater's theater hall has a position to accommodate six hundred people, half-curved, and a total of three wide aisles, all with large red carpets. According to the most fashionable architectural concept, the masonry on the walls is inlaid with hollow wooden planks. The ground and dome are the best aspenwood, which makes the sound more round and clear. The second floor is a large balcony, divided into 30, VIP box, the position of Lauvita is on the second floor from the left to the right of the thirteenth box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repertoire that was staged today is the revenge recorded by Fran, starring two people he does not know. After carefully reading the first act, there are many more meticulous changes in the plot lines. The cardinals have matured. They are no longer the wild team of the year. Even the vocals of the supporting actors can be heard for long-term professional training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be a benign reaction to the money left in the troupe. "I am very happy to help you inadvertently." Fran thought, for him now. In terms of it, hundreds of thousands are only a small number. Based on the dividends from fraud, Fran made his account in the bank a 7-digit number by investing in bonds and cargo ships. Millions of people, although Byron is not the top richest, but also very few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short time of the break between the curtains, there was a knock on the door. Lauvita is just ready to stand up. Fran took her, "I am going to open it, this is etiquette."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The hope that the head shows tonight is gentle rather than guilty." Looking at him. But the man deliberately ignored her words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the door is wearing a small Central Asian cap, wearing a popularly colored dress. The left side of the dress is black, the right side is pink - the semi-bald top Middle-aged man, "You are Mr. Van Graham, I am the management of the Cardinals. You can call me Fier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Mr. Fier, what are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the celebrity of Weber Harbour, the owner of the Black King, the owner of the Knights Street Mansion, 哟"He used the exaggerated tone of the stage play to see that Lauvita sat in the room and smiled, and added a sentence, "is still a beautiful conqueror."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Fairy tone is funny. But complimenting the humble attitude makes everyone not resentful to him. "Thank you for your compliment." Fran took out a gold roll and handed it to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it’s an honor to serve the lords. You are the first time to watch the Cardinals show. People like you, red If you don’t want to come to your box to visit, you can’t say it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How do you know that I am coming for the first time?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the lord who can buy the box to join, the cardinals will remember your kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder the Cardinals In a short period of time, it was developed with only a hundred thousand start-up capital, and it found a good management. At least this conversation revealed two pieces of information: Before the performance of a city, the troupe will collect information on local celebrities, and each person has an identity. The characters who have been to the Cardinals have been recorded one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every theater company develops to a certain scale, and it is the service attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second scene of the speech, the first appearance is a little girl of only 12 years old, playing the protagonist in exile, met in the forest The good heart of the fairy, although the singing is tender. But the pleasing appearance still attracted the audience's admiration. Fran noticed that if the makeup was not perfect, the girl did not seem to be a simple human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairy, who is observing the truth, explains, "Miss Cecilia is a very promising newcomer to the troupe, only to stage four times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Orc? Perfect decoration, can't make that tail move so vividly." Fran stared at the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have a good eyesight, she is an orc, oh, don't imagine the orcs are mentally bloodthirsty monsters, or have Cecilia like this. Little beauty embryo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran thought of the book. "Is she literate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, good education."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Can you introduce me after the show?" Fran once again pulled out the wallet, "Help me give her ten flowers." This is the tradition of the famous troupe. After the performance, every actor gets The bouquet is to evaluate the pros and cons of the performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Fiji did not refuse. When he left, he reminded, "Miss Nicole will appear in the third act, please look forward to it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole, the red-haired, knife-to-mouth mad head. However, Fran is strange, why the management will specifically remind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just closed the door, Lauvita shook his head and said to you, "Your taste is unique, like a little girl?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, that is the preference for women who are not humans alone. If you say this, I also have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took off her gloves and showed the lizard-like small scales to Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Whiteman, please believe that I regard you as the best assistant, the most trustworthy secretary, but sorry, for lovers or husbands, you should There is a better choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a silence in the box, leaving only a slight breath. Half-sounding, Lauvita shouted and laughed. "Of course, I think so too, little jokes." She laughed and burst into tears, groaning her fingers. "Don't care, the last time there was nothing. They are happy with each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wiped her tears away, delicate eyeshadows and faint blush, the flowers were broken and broken, she took a few breaths, "Sorry, my body is a little uncomfortable. I will go back first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan did not retain, early and clear, cruel short-term pain, good for each other. It is difficult for him to bear another feeling, she avoids waiting hopelessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, when she is gone, she will not come back." Fran blessed the girl, "Go find one, good man." He picked up Look around and watch the exquisite performances on the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
