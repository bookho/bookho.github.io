			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. In heaven, the monarch’s preposition is the age of law, and the Earl of the Palace is a prominent and extreme title, which is usually only issued to the great emperor. The most intimate and trustworthy person, in history, there have been many princes who have served as the knight. It has represented many honors such as the highest spokesperson of the royal family and the nobles closest to the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in this era, the Magna Carta, the parliament, the courts, the administrative agencies, the politics, the complexities, and even the most subtle places will be the words of the law, the residence The high-ranking member of the House of Representatives has divided the authority of the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since even the emperor was unable to freely exercise his will, the Earl of the Palace was just a beautiful vase. Now, this kind of life-long title with no inheritance and fiefdom, purely honourable, is even better than the chief executive of the region in terms of actual income and political voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously a well-considered result of the House, and the Lord of the Knights has a wealth of money and more material favors, and can’t show the royal generosity; The foreign aristocrats who own the picks in the country are not in accordance with Byron’s charter. Therefore, the Earl of the Palace is both honourable and does not harm the interests of the majority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some Members have privately questioned, it’s too sloppy to seal a person who appeared in Tantin for more than two months, but no one will be ignorant. Publicly speaking, everyone knows that the cycleon of Kasimodo is the benefactor of His Royal Highness, and the Crown Prince even feels uncomfortable for not being able to give another piece of pick, and he is still a mysterious medicinal pharmacist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family of the aristocratic family of the age-old daughter began to wonder if they would marry the newcomer. Even if the title of the Earl of the Palace can not be passed on to future generations, but the Ingrammaster is flexible, who knows whether he will get the status of the Earl of the Republic with the hereditary rights in the future? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan did not pay attention to these boring things, he is waiting for the arrival of the construction team in Golden Horn Bay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant boxing sergeant Kregan, deliberately found some gang members who did not have a case, apparently innocent, became an employee of the Bo rider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gentleman. It is my most reliable friend. He orders, that is my will." Fran gave Cregan as a crow. Instructed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, are we going to have more bosses?" At that time, Bissus said, "The gangs are today, they are all replaced by their lives. Just give people a coolie?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flagley boss will not harm us." Shawei said with a sigh of relief, he was grateful for Fran's life-saving grace, so that Kregan began to gradually distrust this to follow in the west. His men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a moment of thought, Kregan said with a blink of an eye, "Vangla is the boss after all. If you violate the order and don't say that without his help, we Unable to fight against those horrible dragons, even the little foxes have to rebel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current gang business is roughly divided into two. Smuggling and arms deals are the responsibility of him. The chain of firms and investment houses used for money laundering on the bright side, and the officials, are completely mastered by Lauvita. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Kregan didn't know. Some officials have been accepted for bribery in the bureaucrats of the Gulf and border customs; specifically, which registered companies are gang industries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He controlled the cornerstone of the gang and most of the members, but the little fox who did not enter the oil and salt, but the pulse of the entire gang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without her nodding, the goods smuggled in, there is no channel to sell; the black gold earned, can not be washed into a pure and pure ticket on the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan tried to come by himself, but the new company was closed for three days after it was opened. The secret account was also permanently frozen and lost more than 200,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please respect the agreement, don't reach out to me." Lauvita told him that there was a mockery in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Misunderstanding." Kregan can only say this, although he knows who is doing the ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, 130,000, hit my account within a week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Thirteen thousand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't forget, half of the gang's earnings per head belong to the head. You acted privately and lost 260,000. Don't let your head wipe your ass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, Kregan even wanted to torture the girl in front of him with the most cruel torture, but he finally endured it. He was afraid of the magical power of the crow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many times did this woman have been fucked by a crow? It was actually so docile." He could only curse the viciousness in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Quasimodo Bo Knight, this sudden appearance, makes Kregan seem to see a glimmer of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no alliance in the world that will not betray. If you can reach an agreement with the rich man who is about to become the Earl, you may be able to open Lavetta and the crow behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Work with us for a while, and figure out the details of the person." Krigan thought, "There are many ways to eat than to be killed by Lauvita." Strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Shawei again and said, "You are ready to bring a few people to the south."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"South?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luovita’s chick is not bad, but she was born in Tyrolean to make a piece of land, but She can't continue to stay, you take over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, pack it on me." Shawei patted his chest, he was not good at brains. But rushing to the front to grab the site, but his favorite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kregan thought sullenly, "Tirole's forces are intricate, and the little fox has just smashed the local big man arbitrarily, not at all, you go There, it would be nice to be able to come back alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was always a help for the crow, and Shawei was no longer his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sooner or later, he will kick off all the stumbling blocks and cover the underground business of the Golden Horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the tunnel project started, the two construction teams that were handed over to the outside of Tanding, the real core part, had their own people." Fran drafted on paper "Kregan is always a strong and exclusive person, can share the same suffering, can not be willing, be more guarded against him, fishing with a lure that looks tempting, and Lauvita, she is very capable, But putting a girl in the gang and the wolf is always inappropriate..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
