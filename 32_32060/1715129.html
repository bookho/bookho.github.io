			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The day darkened, the violinist in the tuxedo skillfully played the romantic tunes, the waiters at the Mazian Town open-air restaurant, shuttled for the guests Send a small silver-plated candlestick, and after a while, the table under the umbrella of the mushroom sheds brightly, and the slight candlelight is gentle and gentle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to order?" said Fran Fryer. "I remember that you like shortbread cheese soup and grilled clams." "Casual." Rose shrugged and glanced around, and she spent a few seconds exploring the layout of the open-air restaurant, snooping everyone nearby and studying any potential threats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man knows that this is not a girl’s doubts about her invitation, but a professionally cautious habit, but she still sighs in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dishes are quickly ordered. They are all the favorite flavors of their wives. Fran adds a bottle of local specialties, and he leans into a girl. Full, "Cheers, for our cooperation... and reunion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cheers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He wants to talk about something, but he doesn't know where to start, and the meal is carried out in a silent atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei put down the knife and fork, rubbed his forehead, and pulled the medicine out of the purse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't eat." Fran stretched out his hand and he frowned. "It's really good for your body."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl raised her head, the beautiful face was bathed in the jumping candlelight, and the tone was cold. "Sir, what qualification do you have to control me? We are just allies, not close enough to interfere with each other." Private affairs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, even out of a friend's advice." Fran explained, "You are a good girl, everyone is envious of Flair. Come to you, please believe that the assassin is not for you, living in the sun, isn't it good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I am very puzzled. "An Mei's expression is stiff and there is a feeling of boredom. "You are always talking about how you used to be. What happened in the past, I don't know, I only feel noisy and embarrassed."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you have no memory, brainwashing controls your thoughts and feelings." Fran tried to make his tone calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It must be clarified. I am not interested in the past. You said that I used to have a good family. I only feel like a fool; you said I love my own husband. I completely can't recall the slightest enthusiasm; even now, I don't think how delicious cheese and clams are. The story in your mouth, I sound, it is just another woman's experience. "It has nothing to do with me." She wiped her lips with a napkin and continued. "You are constantly denying me now, trying to get me back, even if those things are true, people will grow up. I don't. The will is for the boring shadow in your mind. Let yourself change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran has been looking for opportunities to reveal his true relationship with An Mei, but at the moment The girl's words. Such as a bucket of cold water poured on the head, let him deep in the soul, there is a kind of pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is indifferent, between him and her, not only through the white tablecloth, but has been a deep crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight shrouded the town, pedestrians, the light of the street lights made people's shadows long, they used the meal, walked slowly on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your revenge has been completed. But my grievances with Joe Corleone have not yet been understood, and I urgently need the information of the King," the girl said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will stop taking the drug after the event, but even if I remember the memory, I am not willing to be a boring housewife again," said the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will remember you, after all, you are the closest friend of my small family, so there is something difficult in the future, even if I am looking for me." . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullan listened with ecstasy, the girl’s voice was as crisp as a bell, like the boiling water in a silver jar. He kept ringing and let him indulge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once upon a time, they were like this, walking side by side in the night of Feidu, he said the anecdote in the court, she was taking care of the family, actually said what It doesn't matter, as long as they are together, they feel happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly grabbed her thin shoulders, bowed her head and pressed the hot lips. The kiss was so sudden that An Mei didn’t react for a while. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is a collision between the person and the roadside stone wall, the sound of the cracked bones, and the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No next time, Mr. Van Graham." An Mei whispered angrily. "If you make any other non-participation, even if you tear up the covenant, I will also dig your heart out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned and walked away, disappearing into the illusory night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran struggled to lift himself up, and the girl’s blow seemed to have turned his internal organs all over, and the pain caused by the heavy sweat made Fran’s underwear Drenched, "You are a stick." He groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally passers-by pass, strange glimpses, a well-dressed handsome gentleman, sitting on the ground without a decent smile, with a weird smile, like As crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, the sinner who was condemned, you destroyed everything about me, now, are you satisfied?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cursed with a smile, there is a thunder of the overlord, gathered in the eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin dusk afterglow gradually retreats, at the time of the work, the workers of the sweaty back are black carbon-like chests, will be small clips On the shoulders, squeezing into the low-rise turret of the low-cost apartment, the hall is noisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruth is wearing a nightdress, there are no underwear in the thin skirt, the rounded ** and the buttocks attract the man’s gaze, she should almost start working, girl In the vicinity of the area is quite famous, there is no need to stand on the street, customers have to take the initiative to find the door, and sometimes even have to make an appointment in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone whistling in a wretched voice, "Hey, come and stay with me when you have time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Roll, want to go to bed with the old lady, take the money." The little niece said disdainfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recently, you are old and the rose stick together, God, have you started to like women?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Chen the roots of the tongue again, the aging mother cuts off your stuff and puts it in your asshole. Also, don't call someone a rose, call Ms. Rogitian Anna." Ruth sweared awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughter, a hard worker named John’s goods came over and clumsily bowed to Peggy. “Hello, my distinguished Rogetti Ms. Anna."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Heaven, hey, he actually said, hello" This kid is really like a scholar. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John smirked his hand and covered his face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The stinky man's mouth Don't mind if you are terrible, they are not malicious. "Ruth squeezed her eyes at Peggy. She just spent a few hours teaching this strange girl who wouldn't even cook it, learning how to fry the eggs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; Miss; Missy is uncomfortable, she can not adapt to this vulgar atmosphere. "Damn, I will not communicate with this group of monkeys." Peggy thought. But nothing, wait until the body of Lilian is a little better, they can leave this stinking place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before She can only be patient.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be patient.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doom is like a bee, hidden in dark and damp Corner gaps, when you find one, it means there is a large group nearby.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 pm. Five gray uniformed policemen broke into the crowded and worn out In the apartment building, the head of the inspector shouted, "All the people stayed in the room, the police station received the line report, and some people were hiding contraband and stolen goods. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They started a search between the left side of the corridor, hands and feet.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't mess with the aging mother's things. "The next door came to Ruth screaming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it a routine, or are you coming?" Peggy squatted out from the crack in the door. The little policeman in this place didn't need to move his fingers in the past. He could send it off. But now, it represents trouble.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julian reluctantly straightened her body. "If there is an accident, I will block them. You will escape along the support frame under the balcony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, The door panel was shaken straight, "Open the door immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be reluctant, you haven't recovered yet, everything is listening to me." Peggy said, she said Under the hair, open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cockerel with a cocky nose and a ugly patrol appeared in front of him. He showed the medal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Ninge Inspector of the Police Station." He glanced at Peggy and showed a surprised expression. "Girls, cooperation, give I stood by the wall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My sister was seriously ill." Peggy said quietly. "She has to rest in bed."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you don't die, you have to get up," the inspector said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little maid squinted dangerously, took a deep breath and bowed her waist. But it involved the wound of the shoulder swelling, the pain caught her, let the girl's face lose its blood, and she wanted to faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy holds her, "Okay, Mr. Inspector." She replied loudly and shook her head slightly, suggesting that Julian was patient and childish. The current health status of the maid is very bad, and it is impossible to deal with five strong men at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was turned upside down, and Peggy was cold-faced. She vowed to retaliate in the future and put all the monkeys in police uniforms into the workload. The most arduous workplace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, there is discovery." A policeman pulled out Missy's radium and silver makeup box from the drawer, and there were two precious earrings lying in the box. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninge is interested in Peggy, and the salesman is not wrong, living in the country of the apartment, it is impossible to have such valuable jewelry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to common sense, it is undoubtedly irony, and I don’t know where the chick got it. He can stuff it into his pocket as long as he threatens it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a little unexpectedly, the other party is actually beautiful like a fairy, and life is a beautiful person who makes people fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is sick, but it is quite good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just thinks about the two beautiful packages that are wrapped in simple clothes, and they feel that the crotch is hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gang rogue detective of the town police station is a person who is good at finding fun for himself. Many of the nieces who have committed the theft of the silver sins, if they are jealous If you can, you will try to get rid of it, in order to get the ass eggs that you can enjoy at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The value of these jewellery is obviously not in line with your identity." He seems to be trustworthy, "may there be any misunderstanding, can you explain clearly?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Rogi Tiana Terry, the eldest daughter of the Baron family in the East, this is my sister, Lola Terry." Said, she pointed to the badge printed on the bottom of the silver cosmetic case. "Open your eyes and clear your eyes. Today, I will appeal to the aristocratic court. You dare to search the room of the baron's heir without permission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninger looked at the delicate Dianthus flower family logo at the bottom of the box and was quite shocked. "Why did the two lords fall here?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My father died in Tantin eight weeks ago, I am rushing back to the capital, attending the funeral, and the subsequent jury ceremony." Peggy said, "But unfortunately, my sister fell ill on the way." "," she deliberately revealed a sad and shy look, "because it is too hurried, except for a few pieces of small jewelry, I have not With too much cash, it has led to the current situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a planned rhetoric, the badge is also forged, at the crucial moment, Peggy is ready to use Imposting the way to delay the time, at least let others do not dare to act rashly before finding out the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive my offense." Ninge seems to accept her explanation, "But due to the rules, you have to go back to the police station for filing, the law is The nobility and the civilians are treated equally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy nodded, and if rejected, it would certainly lead to suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She only had to drag over these days, and when the wounds of Julian were healed, the police in the town could not stop them from leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
