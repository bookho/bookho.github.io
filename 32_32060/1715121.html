In the neckline, I don’t have a silver brooch, and my legs are awkward. He sits in a cafe in the three streets of the city gate. The hand unconsciously grinds the walking stick across the knee. The past waiter secretly uses curious eyes. Look at the unique crutches:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface is different from the convex and concave, that is, the roots are peeled off the bark, and the branches are easily decorated with a knife, but they cost a lot of money, brush The anti-corrosion varnish, at the bottom and the handle, is covered with a layer of thick gold foil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This valuable material can completely create one or two beautiful small pieces of jewelry, but it is used on rotten wood." The waiter secretly said, "The rich man "The quirks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the confidential information file of the authorities, Zall Law Lung, who is nicknamed Mr. Wolf, has been cleverly cautious in accordance with the plan of deliberation. The land contacted Cooper Vonville, and provided some clues to the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zol's Law has seen through the layout of the whole strategy. He privately admits that this conspiracy is bold and risky, but as long as he controls the psychology and character of everyone in the office, It will succeed in pushing a family to the hostile side of the country and destroying a woman’s glorious future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most critical moment in the plan is coming, and if it happens, the stains in his life will be cleansed, from being wanted to being princes. The guest of the Lord and the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power and status are in the process, but Zall is not happy with this, the disgusting arrangement of fate, forced him to join forces with the enemy. He is more willing to personally execute the sinful ally than any honorable honor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, I should change the plan a little bit and bury the guy with his strategy." Zolfa thought more than once, but there was The beautiful eyes are staring at themselves in the dark, and no signs of any abduction are allowed. The owner of the scorpion is An Mei, a female dragon who has excellent skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is aiming out the window, the street is full of people in a hurry, although he can not see the trace of the monitor, but he can feel the existence of the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A waiter came over. "Sir, do you need a cup of coffee?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zall's method pulled the thought back, the coffee on the table was still full of. It has been cool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a moment, "No, check out, I have to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The waiter who tipped the tip, and diligently helped the guests to open the store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zall method sucked cold air, lifted a small suitcase, dragged his legs, and walked outside the city. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hours ago, he had just passed a secret letter and asked to meet with the prince of the prince who was in a hurry for the case of being arrested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showed forged documents. And Zall Fana is quite a costume. After a simple routine inquiry, he went out of town very smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road that extends to the gates of the city is constantly flowing, carrying carriages of heavy cargo. The road surface is always crushed. Although the construction team has come to repair it, and even the road repair tax is added according to the weight of the goods, the road is always broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crutches came into a gap between the sidewalk tiles, and Zall Law couldn’t help but slipped on the hard ground in the exclamation of people. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a leg that is not used!" He climbed up hard, rubbed his legs, and thought desolately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once upon a time. Like the forgiveness of the child, the former secret police chasing the criminals, but now it is easy to accidentally stagger the old man even if he walks normally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people formed the Sichuan River flowing indifferently from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A truck that has just arrived from the port, apparently did not pay attention to the small accident on the roadside, did not slow down, and went straight to the carriageway. The crutches are crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop, don't crush my crutches!" Zall's voice screamed exhaustedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the city gate, there was a loud noise, and the voice was noisy, overshadowing his howl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car did not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zall can't stop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. He has, but it is not a good way, surrounded by people, dozens of meters away from the city tax official and a team of police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's just a common stick, and you can't risk it for it." Zall said that he has always been a rationalist, knowing how to be serious, knowing why A small loss is a fool's job, understand...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the sensible thoughts are finished, a roar in his ear seems to be hot The hot blood rushed to the face, and the feeling of boiling like a flame forced him to tear open the button and take the pistol from the inner pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, the scream spread in the crowd, people rushed around in fear, avoiding the gunshots from where they came from, a carriage The axle suddenly broke, and it fell on the road, causing a new round of turmoil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clenched his crutches and gasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was an old man who fired a gun!" Someone seemed to be shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policeman rushed over with a musket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn! I am crazy, Zall's curse curses my own madness, his brain is spinning fast, but can't think of a way, in the eyes of the public, how to use the sick body to avoid the pursuit of a group of young men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A truck carrying sand and gravel covering the thick canvas on the trailer, suddenly broke off the bundle of wire rope and hook, fine sand and gravel In the sudden black wind, flying and dancing, the hail was squeaking on the ground, hindering the guards' line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are confused? Get some messy troubles!" Crisp like a white spirit, complaining in the drow, a hand pulled him Arms led him, mixed into the crowd, and escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortunately, the crutches are fine." Zolfa smiled reluctantly, and the tone was bitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former secret policeman has always been a selfish man, living in a world of paranoid construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally found out that in the heart of the temple, in addition to the mother, there are other things worth cherishing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, that treasure does not refer to this cane that is causing trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The soul that is annihilated will ascend into the kingdom of heaven, and enjoy the immortal happiness in the presence of the Father's mercy."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long square black wooden scorpion lies quietly in the hall, covered with a layer of red cotton brocade, Ma Tida is humbly chanting the requiem, she stands in front of the coffin, for the deceased Pray for happiness in your life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan grinned and said kindly, "Thank you very much, bless my dead friend."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the prayer, he and the samurai girl came downstairs. The innkeeper who called the sleepy eye, asked for some hot water and snacks, cut the candle and talked at night, and exchanged experiences with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Matilda, the "competitor Toposo" is a man of old world experience, the girl abandoned the church and inherited the old god The belief, decided to use his own eyes to re-examine this familiar but strange world. Just like an apprentice with a strong desire for knowledge, I can't wait to get good guidance from all sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is trying to figure out the girl’s current actions, although deep inside, he has a faint pity for Matida, but this emotion can’t be rushed Thin and deeper vigilance and hostility.

I fell into the trap of the devil, fortunately the blessing of the Father, let me restore freedom." I remembered that she had been with the devil.

He applauded to evaluate his own actions and continued to ask, "For private curiosity, I really want to Knowing who it is, can make a sword of glory in heaven, so unrelenting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida did not hear the mixed words in the words Ironic. She explained, "He is not a human being, or a person on the surface, but it is different from ordinary people, a monster with only two legs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Day, I am listening to a fantasy, or time back to mythology?" Fran haha ​​laughed. "I thought that the devil is just a nickname."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Please be sure to believe that the holy warrior must be honest, I really feel the undead breath from him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The more you say the more outrageous "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mattida is so anxious and full of understanding, after all, in this era, even the Master who still exists in the world, in the eyes of ordinary people, They are far away and unreal, not to mention the souls of the dead, only appearing in the image of strange stories. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have seen her anxiety. "Mr. Toposo" is like a child. He smiles and says, "Okay, no matter what his Identity, and talk about what a great sin he has?

"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not yet chased each other's sin. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, then it is a personal grievance. You mentioned it before and fell into his trap. So, did he violently attack you?" Please forgive me for taking the liberty, let an ice-clear jade, and the girl who cherishes the heavens of the country lose her chastity. It is indeed a horrible sin. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran, with the maliciousness of teasing, looked at Matida's red-hot, eager crying face, and the girl stammered. "No, although I was framed, I made some It violates the sin of morality and universal law, but it does not lose..." At the end of the day, her voice was almost like a mosquito. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Excise me, what is your identity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Identity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the Knight of Anno, not the policeman of Byron, but want to go beyond the law of the world to judge?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, a ghost, trying to mix into the mortal, certainly have another picture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, so you have not committed The crime, want to purify him?"

"Is it wrong to sweep away sin for the world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also admit your mouth The devil is a Man, but the law of the law, and the justice of the law, to kill him, to interrogate him." Fran stared at the girl's eyes, "Of course, for the guilty person, you have the right to hunt him , accused him, this is the support of the law of the common people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But your true intentions, really?" He took a deep breath, " Your actions are only in revenge, for the revenge of the past, for the anger of the heart to find catharsis, the road to revenge, not sacred, nor justice.
