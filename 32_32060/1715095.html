			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. The entire top of the Feidu after receiving the news of the disappearance of Chu Jun, he was panicked, as if the sky had fallen. The officers of the Intelligence Bureau and the patrol hall were most severely reprimanded. The mayor also ordered the Sloan General to make a stern order. The culprits must be found within three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sloan’s general patrol desperately thought, “My future is over.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Instead, he envied the inspector Lyme, who had been blind to the eye, and was able to stay in the hospital bed and take it leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Crown Prince’s secret visit to the city that never sleeps can no longer be blocked. The media used the dog-like sense of smell to first sense the wonderful news theme. They were stuck in the street of the villa. Anyone who came out was surrounded by reporters. Noisy noises like the heat of the summer, all kinds of small-scale public opinion made the city full of wind and rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant guests have tried to enter the villa, visit the prince of the prince, in their hearts, just the right time to comfort a prominent position, Wang Min, who is lost, shows himself The position and friendship are undoubtedly a very good political investment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speculative politicians only saw a sneering woman with a dangerous light in her eyes, and the expression of her face was as shocking as a statue, like a The hungry female leopard, who saw the delicious meat, was calmly and cruelly trying to figure out how to cull the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villa’s Golden Rose Hall has become the command center of the case, orderly, the intelligence officer of the security department of Tantin, the royal knight, and the experienced local exploration After being assigned, the investigation investigated all the clues, and the reports came together like snowflakes, piled up with the desk in front of Peggy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missy sees this as a game, a dangerous game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a clue from the sailor who provided a clue. He had seen a guard who went out of the city with the temple. Asked him about a travel company's office in the harbour. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Feidu Ocean Travel Company had just acquired all the shares by a businessman half a month ago and has already changed hands. But they have not seen the purchaser." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp "?? never seen determined not to cover up the lies" <br <br /> & nbsp />;"The man's bid is 50% higher than the market value. They are stunned by the ticket. They are cheering and signing the transfer agreement in a hurry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, there are The janitor of the apartment building also provided clues, and he met Lord Harry. At that time, the guardian inquired him about a tenant named Ward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Do you have a Ward's clue?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a Portuguese-born psychologist who is currently missing the same family. We also found a travel agency. The brochure, which happens to be the surveyed Feidu Ocean Travel Company."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The travel company has a leisure resort estate on the offshore hilly island, but is in semi-development The state, no visitors, interrogated the former owner of the company, he indicated that the brochure was new.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also wonder why a semi-finished resort is now starting "The passengers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the hilly island, we found a ship that was burnt into a wreck There are also the bodies of the two blood knight guards, surrounded by mess, apparently after a supernatural battle, the Highness is attacked by the gangsters on the island. The enemy also has the power of very human."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy calmly listened to the analysis of her subordinates. If she thought about it, she touched her ruddy lips. "It’s a series of abductions, and Julius is fooled out of the city. The occasion of the attack. From the well-prepared urban area, to the chaotic harbour, and even the uninhabited island.” Peggy tapped her knees with her fingers. "But I don't want to understand why Julius is eager to see a psychiatrist. Otherwise, he will not be able to run away from the carrots and be caught by the hunters." No one can answer this question, too. No one dares to speculate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a new clue puts Peggy into confusion, which is provided by the blood knight members who stayed in the villa guards, "For several years, the Royal Guards have been In the tracing of a secret association called 'Shadow King', members are all dragons with supernatural abilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"影王?!" Peggy is different Whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness knows this organization?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to be in the file of the Justice Department. I have read some information about the association."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Royal Guards and the Shadow King handed over to the hands. Sadly, we lost two fighters, and today, it is already the fourth.” The blood knight speaks angrily. “I just checked the body that was transported back from the rocky island. It’s already two dead bodies. The muscles wither and the bones become very brittle. The enemy has an ability to absorb energy, and a colleague who sacrifices to Tantin also dies from this attack. The blood knight has detailed records and can be read at any time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy frowned, the situation was beyond her expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She and the king of Shadow King: Shadowwalker Joe Corleone is in an alliance of mutual use, and, in no way, believes that Joe Corleone dares to betray She, not to mention, they do not currently have a conflict of interest, which is not logical. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy continues to attack, they take the means of harassment, like playing a combination of boxing, imaginary, no one knows, hidden in the trick The deadly heavy punch, when to attack.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A threatening letter was caught in the newspaper of the day and slipped in.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authorities immediately investigated the department responsible for the daily necessities of the villa, but the newspaper was sent to the management department by the issuing agency. The number of gangsters along the way was the opportunity to approach the delivery staff who sent the report, and could not continue the investigation.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the threatening letter is very strange: "Freedom! We don't want to be a tool to be manipulated! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing the letter, Peggy said calmly, "I wish you a gift tonight." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of guards has doubled, and the Philadelphia Metropolitan Government has also been devastated, and the terrorists who could not be found are pressing harder. The entire high-level resignation of the capital has stepped down, and it is impossible to restrain the anger of the royal family or the gorse family.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cavalry battalion is about to arrive at Feidu, stationed in Queens Island The Navy also closely observed any turmoil, and it is said that a blood knight unit and the private arm of the Reinschmann family have already started from Tantin.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;At nine o'clock that night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a small explosion in the backyard of the villa, with no casualties, but caused considerable confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows why the explosion happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s another intimidation, an attempt to make me flustered." Peggy said she personally came to "Mary Anne" - the aristocratic class implicitly on the back garden Elegant title - check the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The explosion came from the pigeons." The experienced agent reported that "we have arrested the servant responsible for cleaning the pigeon cage. She has very The big suspect is spies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wrong, I think I know the enemy's wrists." Peggy said, "The pigeons are social birds, if anyone Flying three or four pigeons with miniature time bombs in the vicinity, they will find the nearest ethnic group in the night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought again miss you. "The pigeons can't carry a heavier and more powerful bomb. The so-called gift is such a small trick? Perhaps..." Missy turned her head and slammed into the main building of the villa, "leading the attention of most guards so that... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another more violent explosion was born in the main building, almost shattering the glass on the first floor, the flames burned and swallowed up the curtains and carpets. It is getting worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls of the corridor were sprayed with red paint on the walls to "give us freedom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Everyone looks at each other. I don't know what it means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is the assassin of the Dragon's maiden. It is not tall, it should be a woman, and the speed is quite fast. It is impossible to prevent it. If it is not her unintentional fight, the prince of Chuan is not inside the villa. Otherwise the consequences are unimaginable." The blood knight staying behind was injured, and he shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;龙脉者? Really will be the shadow king? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;笃Finger King will not betray his own Peggy, and there will be a crack in his heart. She combined the slogan of the enemy to analyze. "Joe Corleone can't control the whole organization, and internally split a group of members who are not willing to sell for his life and want to live freely?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although many details don't make sense. However, it can explain the behavior and ideas of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, is the enemy deliberately letting himself think about this? But who knows the secret covenant between her and Joe Coleon, except for the movie king? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it may be that the separatists are asking for a meeting place, and if they want to return the kidnapped prince, they will have to provide a fortune to leave Byron safely. Going to the new country to seek a new life of freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Peggy never compromised when threatened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss, through her own channel, conveyed instructions to the film king. In any case, he has to pay a fee. Explain clearly and work together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Joe Coleone dares not to respect, she will completely rid the ally from this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ordinary people or small nobles, the mysterious Dragon Assassin is undoubtedly a terrifying existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in Peggy’s eyes, that’s just a group of better-handed thugs, behind her, but standing with the power and arm of a strong country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black King drifted on the rough waters. In the evening, there was a storm in the straits of two hundred miles, affecting the climate near Feidu. The exquisite yacht has gathered all the sails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a box in the waves, but the perfect assembly line keeps it balanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is roaring outside the window, thunder and lightning, like the door to hell is opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia is burying herself with a broken pineapple and laughing, she looks up, her lips with creamy white beard, looks very cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very good." The girl shouted, "The two were solved in ten minutes, and they were full."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Fran lured Chu Jun to the hilly island, Cecilia, who was lurking on the side, suddenly attacked. The king-level dragon's loli was very comfortable with this line, and Julie's bodyguard Harry first noticed the danger. If you change the environment and get ready, his strength can be turned over with Cecilia, but unfortunately, he has stepped into the trap of "Nepenthes". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle lasted for a short time, even if Fran had no time to stop, Cecilia would swallow the life of the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I have blood in my hand, and when I am in hell, the angry souls of the dead will bite me without even bones." "Fran sighed in the bottom of his heart, but now is not the moment of self-trial, his heart must be harder, otherwise it will only harm everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crown Prince is now locked in the room hidden by the ship, Lauvita proposes, "Just send his head back, even if some people think that there is still Hey, but the maddening royal family will hold the mind of Ning, killing and ignoring, and will not hesitate to annihilate the shadow king at the same time. And the lady, in order to avoid getting caught in the upper body, will stand by and watch."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't allow to kill Julius, you don't make your own claims." Fran told. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of his plan is to introduce An Mei to Fei Dulai, the idea to catch her, if it is brainwashed and controlled by drugs, Fran Can lift the imprisonment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Julius is dead now, the King of Shadows will be encircled by the army, which will endanger the safety of An Mei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Lauvita answered, the shadows in her heart are getting heavier and heavier, not for the sake of the head, but for their own private guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The head seems to want to save someone in the shadow king, is that...the female devil? Is it six people can and Lauvita Whitemane Fighting for men.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Day, I was kidnapped. This is a group of gangsters who have no good at all. They are not ashamed of sin, they are despicable. Dirty to the extreme..." Julius tried to push the firm door of the bedroom, which was built for imprisonment, without windows, and covered with iron sheets.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior decoration is quite fine. Chu Jun was not abused and tortured. He was searched, but the other party did not take any items in his pocket. He was afraid and the mental negative fluctuations became more and more frequent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
