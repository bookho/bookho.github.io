"I just investigated that the wanted criminal had bought a ticket for a long-distance public carriage." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the specific situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The six-point car, heading north, destination It is the Russian-Saudi border."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s 7:10, the car has already been out of town, damn, the guard of the gate, I haven’t found it!” The inspector immediately directed, "I will inform the Secretary of the new clues, I need the assistance of the patrol cavalry team to block the northbound main road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laugha almost simultaneously I got this information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gang’s informant in the patrol station heard the news that Zolfa Lungi had just escaped from the city and headed to the northern border. Fitch said. After seeing the wanted order, he breathed a sigh of relief, but he was even more afraid of the strength behind the Ravetta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since Donna’s godfather fell down, I have to find another backing. The purpose of this lady should not stop there, the gang forces in the Golden Horn Bay. I began to infiltrate into the south, then, I..." Fitch sneaked at Lauvita. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How was the police station found?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be a bank account The guy went to buy a lot of equipment for field trips, but he didn't have time to pick up the goods and slipped away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girl picks up gray eyes Silence for a long time, "Yesterday's wanted order came out, can the gray people catch the prisoners today? If the patrol police has such efficiency, then no one in the world dares to sin. And the head warned me, that person It’s not an idiot that will easily reveal the horse’s feet.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly stood up and shouted, “Go ask the salesperson who received the Longchi, I want to know him. The purchase receipt, and what he said, what he did."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the small restaurant directly opposite the hotel, Zolfa raised his hand and lowered his hat. Said to Paris, "The efficiency of the Tyrolean police is really low, and it is later than I expected. Now the main police force has been transferred, and the security of the city gate will not be so strict. We will leave at 7:30. Take a time difference with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where can we go..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"West I know a few high-ranking friends in the Western Dark Police Hall. They can help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that Paris looked a little hesitant, "She I’m already suspicious.” Zall’s thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it doesn't matter. As soon as he got out of the city, he was also ready to take the female baron off and let the stupid girl become a bait for the paralyzed enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran has been paying attention to the news of Tyrolean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information sent by the Security Department, the lord of the slain, the Druid Lung, has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the local patrol police investigation, the wanted criminals should have fled to the northern border, and now the police have sown the nets and cooperated with the Russian border patrol. It is imperative that the prisoner be arrested and brought to justice before he goes abroad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the focus of this world. Another little thing is left unattended: a wealthy female baron in the city of Tyrol. Missing a few days ago, the whereabouts are unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laovita wrote a secret letter yesterday telling Fran two things. After Zallfa Longchic secretly left the city, he threw Paris in the wilderness and fled alone. At present, the female baron was caught by her people and was in the palm of her hand; the sly man deceived the police, his destination. It is by no means the northern border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are two clues, which are tortured by Paris. In fact, it’s not that much, the funny woman cried and said Everything Zall is going back to the west. But I checked that he was in a shop. He bought a lot of wild travel items, including thick-soled spikes, climbing hooks, fixing frames and other mountain tools." Lauvita said in the letter, "The west is his origin. When the rabbit is frightened, he always chooses to escape to the familiar nest, but his move from the city does not seem to be just a fault in the old cloth, between the south and Tantin. The avenue is also a steep mountain with a wide unmanned smoke. It is also possible that he wants to climb the mountain and go to the capital. I divide the manpower into two groups, one to go to the west to search, and the other to I personally lead the team across the mountain. Tracking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I promise not to let you down. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does she want? "Fran will extinguish the burnt smoke and pick out one from the clip. His addiction is getting bigger and bigger." How can Livetta's cleverness be indulged in him for so long? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless, she also wants to know my secret through Zolfa Lonchi. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran knows that the girl has deep curiosity about herself, and when women have feelings, they are often not so rational.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked on his forehead and continued to think, "Fran Freire is still alive, this thing that transcends common sense, only two people in the world know, and I don’t know that Longchi knows, but he The information currently available is enough to cause little trouble for myself. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran has many ways to annihilate trouble. For example, the dead will never reveal the truth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Yes, as long as he makes a small snack, the road to revenge will be much better.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill out Matilda Hepburn, kill Zall Law Lonchi, it is easy to turn all the obstacles into cold bodies under the soil of the cemetery.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can get rid of many Unpredictable troubles, put all energy and time into the dark battle with the enemy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you feel awkward...Fran’s breathing is a bit rough This evil thought is like the devil's sweet whisper, tempting him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullan smiles, "I kidnaped Paris because she violated the law and intended to murder. Whether it is a civilized world or a barbaric kingdom, these are not worthy of forgiveness. However, Zall F. Longch’s behavior against me did not deviate from the track of the law; Ma Dida’s pursuit was also based on the gods and beliefs of the church. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, don't think of yourself as great, then be fair." The immortal will of the meditation is what mortals can represent. "He thought again, "I don't want to be infected, just because it is a drug. If you have tasted the blood and enjoyed the convenience and benefits it brings, you can't extricate yourself." I just don't want to be blind mad. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
