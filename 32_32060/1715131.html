Compassion is to bring itself into failure. The devil of the path, Peggy feels right, her soft heart makes the situation even more bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she goes out of town immediately, she will have no twists and turns, and after the monkeys are thrown away, the little tricks will not last long, and they have to race against time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she can’t leave her, she never gives up any loyal followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Miss Miss missed the best time to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depiction of the police officers who followed Ningehu’s fake Huwei, especially after the sheriff’s lower body that made every man feel painful, The town police station quickly listed the case as a major case of assaulting police, serious injuries and attempted murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sirens thundered through the town, and at least 20 town policemen and a nearby team of road patrols rushed into the dirty streets and settled. The economic apartment turned over to the sky. Fortunately, the two of them took a step earlier and were not caught on the spot, but they were still trapped in the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two young blond women, the authorities suspected that they were female assassins belonging to the gang, this is a serious provocation of the gang to the police!" The police received notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, Ashes wouldn't think of searching for warehouses." Ruth yawned and licked the candle on the candlestick with pointed nails, slightly igniting the fire. Brighter, at the emergency of a few hours ago, when Missy had no way to go, the apartment workers and the little niece extended their help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the warehouse of a freight company in the town. Xiao Zhi happens to be the small supervisor of the company, has the key, and temporarily placed two girls, avoiding the search. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior is filled with the smell of musty and garbage. It is two o'clock in the morning, the night is the best shelter for people, but when the freight company starts work tomorrow morning, they I have to be forced to leave. Go back to the street full of police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can’t walk tonight, you’re in trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julie coughed and coughed, "Master, all because of me, not only made you almost wronged, but now... I have to say again, you should know how to choose. You should not turn back."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up," Peggy yelled. "Are you suspicious of my decision?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruth listens The bickering between the master and the servant took a picture of the brain. "Hey, I am more and more curious about your identity. To be honest, you are definitely not going to the relatives of the country." She was worried. "You will not be true." What is the sinful female gangster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What if it is?" Peggy answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't believe, the old lady's eyes are bright, can see who is a good person." Ruth grinned. "Let's say we are good sisters. I don't help this person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy didn't overdo it, said hard, "Hey. What do you think, In short, thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of help from the monkeys, so Missy was very angry, but grace is a blessing, especially Peggy hates others. Human feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruth suddenly said a mysterious gossip, "But Xiao Zhi is pitiful, that silly boy has been secretly in love with you, I think he will definitely not return ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiao Zhi? Secret love? Peggy was confused and she didn't have any impression of the man. In fact, she was cold and cold to anyone except the little niece who was wrapped around her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since you came to the apartment on the first day, he stared at you with a stupid look, and his eyes were straight." Ruth, "that fool. People are quite authentic, always like to put on a good husband, and often tell me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get a serious job, but like me, I have never read a book girl, Can't sell physical strength like a man, where is there any job to find..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She talks endlessly about Xiao Zhi, even the feelings are slow Peggy, I can also hear that Ruth likes Xiao Zhi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the future, I will seal the title of Xiao Zhi, let you marry the past, be a Viscountess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missy generously rewarded the award. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruth certainly wouldn’t believe Peggy’s words, thinking she would tune you again, “... don’t talk, he’s not crushing me.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, if he doesn't marry you, I will hang him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Ruth blushes. "The idiot should be hanged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Xiao Zhi pushes the door to the news and strangely looks at the girls laughing into one The regiment, he said anxiously, "it is very strict, and there are police officers on duty at the intersections of the dealers and the entrances and exits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pei Ji Liu Mei Wei, "etc. It’s even harder to get out of town when it’s dawn.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I have an idea.” Xiao Zhi said, he obviously didn’t know that he had just been decided by the secret object. Life is at home. "At dawn, the company has a car loaded with leather goods to drive out of the town. The car is very big. It is no problem to hide two people. I talked with the employees of the car and worked for him."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's worth a try. Paige gave him a smile with appreciation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s breathing was so fast that the person shivered with excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, fool." Ruth screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will hang him, sure, if you don't plead," Peggy comforted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vicious, ruthless words, swirling in the heart of Julius von Como: I did not ask him to love me... disgusting Waste... This is murder...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is saddened and lost, and when the particle is shot into the chest, his wife’s face is like a ghost that cannot be rid of. A never-ending nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the love and ** of Chu Jun, the beautiful little family he created in his mind, and the hope of many beautiful happiness, at that moment , cracked, broken, and the smoke disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alcohol is a good thing, paralyzed, and embarrassing, for the time being let the damn real filthy world fade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Julius, you must cheer up, the big aristocrats of the gorse family and the elders' house are thinking about putting the blood of the empire!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...you should enact the imperial order, turn Leinschmann into a chaotic thief, backed by the uncle's army, plus the name of the righteousness, victory will surely It belongs to the royal family's double-headed lion's flag."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Day, do you look like a decadent, worthy of the supreme throne?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of awkwardness came from a strange country, and he barely let the cocoon aim at the focal length. Julius seemed to see Prince Tver, his exuberant blood uncle, face Disappointed expression, what was in his mouth, pushed the door and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius supported the body, looking for a good medicine to relieve pain with red eyes, his feet were full of empty bottles, a wolf membership. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do?" The Crown Prince used his trembling hands to drink the residual wine. He whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You need strength." The ghost in the stone replied, "Hey, the prince, is burning an ambitious fire in his heart, treating you as a chess piece." Think about you becoming a waste man, a father who has been lingering, and Byron’s national bureau is quite uncomfortable at this moment, like a gunpowder barrel that can be detected at the moment. I can expect the coming of civil strife. The royal army is against the great aristocracy.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The empire does not need civil war, I will not sign the imperial order." Julius is always the prince of the empire, has received excellent elite education, he understands what can be done, What can't be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not for you at the time." The ghost shouted. "You are always a beggar. I used to be played by my wife. I was kidnapped by the villains. Now, I can only Dancing in the palm of the prince. Everyone regards you as the cornerstone of your footsteps. You have no control over your own destiny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So please tell me. How to get strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost is silent, as if thinking, finally. It is like a painful decision. "The eternal cabinet, the wreckage of the sacred sect, although only left a little divine power, but for the ordinary people, it is enough to make people reborn, with mysterious power, as a guardian spirit. I know how to integrate it with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chu Jun seems to have heard the invisible friend, the deep sadness in the words. "What about you? Will you still appear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My child. When a mortal is dead, I will not live forever. When the holy device transforms your body, I will disappear." The ghost is like a sorrowful saint. "But nothing, I will look at the heavenly smile." You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone has forsaken me, only you are loyal." Julius squinted and his face was miserable. "No. I Never let you die for yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are fucking really kind, the ghost is angrily thinking, it follows the temptation to decide to release the drug," Do you know the villain, who is your tragic man?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The despicable kidnapper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "It's not human, it's just a living corpse." The ghost hated to say that in the cave kiln, when the man used the Holy Power to save Julius, he recognized it. Who is the former sewer, destroy his plans Gods suture strange bird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance is different, but the sacred power of the eternal cabinet is real, the sewing blame can pass the mortal eyes, but it does not mean his supernatural perception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Live corpse?" The Crown Prince is puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You remember, how did Byron get the holy device?" The ghost explained, "The sorcerer Rio Angertes steals the eternal from Anno. The cabinet, hiding in the underground waterway of Feidu, did not escape the pursuit of the samurai. The two sides fought in the waterway and died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius Head, he knows the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "During the study of the sacred objects by the sacred gods, the corpse was once used to create a monster with independent thoughts, tall and tall, full of scars and ugly." The ghost is very depressed. In order to bury the truth, it must be called in a disgusting tone. "The monster finally escapes not only the waterway, but also the ability to bring people back to life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You said...the kidnapper's head is the stitching blame?" Julius recalled the scene at the time. When he felt that consciousness was gradually blurred, he saw the holy light, and the man used incredible skills. He is about to die and he is saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But his appearance is not in accordance with what you said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Transformation magic, in the category of occult, although rare but not non-existent. "The ghost said, "Magic pharmacy, alchemy and metamorphosis, can make a monster, change the class."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potion? Julius's heart moved, "...Cassimodo Boss Court Count, he is tall, scarred, proficient in potions, and, even, Peggy has even recovered from the Holy See." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think about it again, Feidu, the law, the dead, the former lover of your sinister wife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Fran, Flair?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost continues to imply that "the Earl of the Court of the Knights is ugly, known as the Law, and is a A disciple of the Alchemist, who claimed to be an explorer who traveled to Ingmar and traveled the world, but who can confirm it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have read Feidu In the case of the patrol hall, the Fleet prosecutor was prosecuted by the first court for interrogating the suspected Igo Andech, and died after the murder. The whereabouts of the corpse were unknown, and the time was right and the gods lurked in the waterway. The date of the sacred object coincides."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is indeed a rumor that Igo Andech is the gorse family underground The spokesperson of the world." Julius's thinking is getting clearer and clearer," and William, the alchemist who appeared in Tantin, used to work for the aristocratic court in Fedo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes, everything is connected!" the ghost shouted. "Fran Flair is the cycleon of Quasimodo. I have reason to believe that his death is a gorse. In secret, this, the undead is wrong, re-walking in the world, he subtly changes his body, using two very different identities to disguise, he vows to retaliate against all enemies, and even destroy Byron to calm the hatred of the heart The fire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news is like a Thunder shock, let Chu Jun stunned, "If you really said, he should hate Leinschmann , not me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you married Peggy! Think about it, from the wedding to the present, have you touched her? Prove her Innocent? The woman has long given her body and heart to her lover. She will abandon her husband and betray the family. You are just a ! & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp dark wretch, which has long Gou together for adultery a "<br <br /> & nbsp />;</div>
