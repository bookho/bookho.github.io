The second trial was also conducted in a heavy atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ladies and gentlemen, you must have thought through the defense of the Darmak family. Imagine that the title and honor of all of you depend on the ancestors' merits and Her own efforts, and now, a young girl, there is no substantial evidence to prove her identity," Bai Tutai's prosecutor went to the lawyer's seat to stand, staring at Matida for a while, spirited The girl smirk at him. "If this solemn court suddenly becomes funny, then a woman with no culture and unclearness will change into a class and become a person who is on an equal footing with someone at the place.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What better thing to trample on the dignity of the nobility? It is conceivable that people from all over the country will laugh at the present, the so-called nobles, no need for excellent Blood, wisdom, and merit, but with a lawsuit, you can get the status that we may have for decades or generations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawyers complained "His judge, the prosecution’s words are full of malicious attacks on the parties."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But late, the words of the prosecutor have already played a role, People whispered and talked a lot. Even the judge warned Bai Tutai symbolically, and told the lawyers, "Please come up with more favorable evidence. I don't want to hear the words that are not trustworthy. Otherwise, this The serious inheritance dispute will become a farce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, who is the only one that can be trusted?" The lawyer looked frustrated, he asked the white map Thai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person who really has the right to prove her identity," said Whitehead, smirking, "The Baron Old Dalmark, not the so-called helper and The housekeeper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal spies have a true intelligence. The old baron, except for the intermittently weak breathing, is no different from the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in the name of visiting the doctor, the emperor sent a doctor and two advisors. To make sure it is not sick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he does not need to pretend to be sick. If he can make a will to admit his daughter early, the lawsuit will not be able to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the old baron is a miser, never thought of looking for a daughter, would rather bring money into the coffin, not to let the breath stop, never let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he was relieved to make a fuss about the identity of the heir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer bowed his head and no one saw it. The conspiracy on his face was awkward. "When I was adjourned, I wanted to call a new witness. Now, he is here, waiting in the back room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Please inform the identity of the witness, I have to consider whether his words are reliable, rather than wasting valuable judicial time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer’s words let the court There was a ripple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His judge, the new witness is Baron Old Dalmark. His body is weak now. However, after several doctors’ examinations, he is conscious and in line with the confession. Legitimacy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Baron Old Dalmark was assisted by others. When walking slowly into the hall, Bai Tutai felt a panic, which is absolutely impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the detectives in the Intelligence Agency who are eating and growing up? Their negligence is fatal to me." The prosecutor leaned on the table, not Let the sudden vertigo feel overwhelmed, and the imperial body stood straight and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eye socket is deep, the hair is like the dead grass that has been shrinking in the harsh winter, and the face is white and lustrous. The hand that emerged from the sleeve of the sleeve was as if there was only a layer of dull skin on the bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not that he can still speak fluently, everyone will think that the mummy is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His old baron, may I ask, this lady sitting on the right, is your daughter: Darmak Paris?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head blankly and looked at it blankly for a while, "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to stand? Wills. Acknowledgment of her inheritance rights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"willing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because your daughter doesn't know how to deal with things, would you like to hand over custody to your nephew: Heber Darmack?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know very well Little Heber is the best candidate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old baron’s words are squeezed out of the throat tube, dry, no feelings, it seems His orthogonal generation is something of someone else's family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer spreads his hand to the crowd. "The harsh laws will not stop a father from giving the family business to his daughter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Tutai has come forward. "Hello, from your words, I can't hear your love for my daughter. Is it something you can't say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hopes that the other party is coerced and said insincerely, this is the only clue he can grasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really don't like this child, but the family business, not passed on to my descendants, is it confiscation into the national treasury?" The old baron asked the prosecutor to find no more For any reason, to prevent the judge from pronounced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the emperor’s entourage went to Bai Tutai and whispered a few words to him. The prosecutor’s face changed and hesitated and repeatedly compromised. The judge requested: “The application for trial was postponed for a few days.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge did not seem to agree. “Now the party has come, I think this lawsuit should end here. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We also have an important witness who is not present and asks you for your consent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge Due to the majesty of the Emperor's Majesty, "I can promise you your request, but you must go to court again tomorrow without any delay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Tutai sadly laughs Laughter, in his career, he has never had such a reversal of failure, his accumulated reputation has been destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, one night, he couldn’t think of any way to defeat him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, Bai Tutai can't believe that the old baron can still go to court to testify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the condition of this old thing, I should have stayed a few feet deep underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, is the intelligence wrong, or is there a supernatural event? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back at the audience, and I don’t know when the emperor’s imperial had left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old number of 14th Street in São Paulo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small hotel, the first floor is the owner and the couple live together, the second floor has only four bedrooms, this half-home half-rental hotel, the price low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bobede is standing in front of the door, he just got down from the carriage, a few steps, rubbed bright shoes, was contaminated a few Mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he can only hope that what the letter said, things have a turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, Pobade would have to face the anger of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am looking for Mr. Tiewen." Pobed said to the boss who came to meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He soon saw the straw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gray-haired middle-aged man is well maintained. The skin is healthy and rosy, and there are no fine wrinkles in the corners of the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, I have to apologize, not trusting your words, leading to a dilemma."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "People will only regret not learning to swim when they are drowning; only in hell will they crave the sunshine that they never cherish." Carl, Steven's accent is arrogant, although the imperial hate is not respectful. But it adds a bit of confidence. The wise and the prophets are all virtues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he can save himself from the coming anger of the emperor, as long as he can really be a prophet, the imperial thinks that everything can be forgiven "In fact, I have been paying attention The case, and the harvest, the real Dalmac Paris, is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean, in the courtroom Is it a counterfeit?" Pobed shook his head. "The truth is not important. The key is that the old baron has personally admitted. Even if it is a quality product, it has become a real thing."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the old baron in conformity with the legality of the testimony? As far as I know, he is already ill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a doctor's certificate. And tomorrow We have no time to overturn the unreliability of the doctors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A patient who is dying, suddenly improved?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s incredible. Otherwise, he bought the officials of the Intelligence Agency and released the smoke bomb. But I can’t believe that more than a dozen agents and consultants are betrayed. The Emperor's Majesty. Even if you are a high-ranking lord, you can't do this." Pobed said without reservation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is difficult, we have to find a breakthrough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the breakthrough? "No, I don't know, there is a condition, tomorrow's final review, I will replace Mr. Bai Tutai and become the chief prosecutor."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you can't say a way. How do I believe in you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you were before the second trial I can find me, the current situation can be avoided. Now, I can only go to the court to find a way." Fran smiled and touched the moustache on his mouth. "I have the confidence to let the case return to the hope of the emperor." On the track."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you qualify for the court?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, I It is also a prosecutor." He took out the documents and the seal on the top was not forged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pobed sighed and looked at him with a sullen look that made him look more aging. "Well, it depends on you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Pobed is not optimistic about the turnaround tomorrow, but he wants to keep the position of Bai Tutai, privately, there are several disputes, Bai Tutai help solve the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can succeed, it will be a joy; if it fails, at least Bai Tutai will not bear all the blame. When he plays some tricks on the report." Let this guy become the biggest reason for failure. The current progress of the case is that no prosecutor will dare to take over, he has to hit himself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Fran is also thinking, only to find reasons to confirm that the words of the old baron can not be used as evidence in the judiciary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only way out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give me all the information you have prepared before going to court." Fran said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Send immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Fran looks at a large stack of tables Instruments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris knocked in the door, "Mr. Tivin, are you sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, now you just need to take a good sleep, raise your spirits, and go to court tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I can find my cousin directly, that is, The viscount of the viscount, the family, is arguing for you to die in court. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not hold this idea." Fran warned, "He can I didn’t have a good idea, and even if I won the lawsuit, you should be the heir to watch out for the cousin, but he is ambitious to control your pick.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"We are a family." Paris was red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the face of interests, feelings, is a luxury to priceless things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisi is still kind enough to think for others. "But the cousin and the emperor are facing each other. Is he not afraid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Behind him, but the gorse, most A noble family of nobles." Fran was moved by the pure conscience of the girl. "Presumably, he has given half of the ownership of the pick to the gorse in exchange for support."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl opened her eyes in surprise, in the eyes of ordinary people, the gorse represents all the aristocratic classes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, go to sleep." Fran patted the girl's head and sent her out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to invest in the instrument, "There are many things that can be shown. The baron is not willing to give others half a dollar, his son, because Money, you can only buy a cheap horse, and the result is broken ribs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more ridiculous is that during the period of recuperation, he still reluctant to spend money for his son to ask famous doctors and expensive drugs, which led to the death of the brother of Paris, the body is weak, and finally passed away at the age of 35. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This greedy person will cooperate in a cooperative agreement to give custody - equal to the ownership of his property to the priest Heber?<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old baron is definitely having problems according to Peggy’s mode of thinking and acting style.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t make the golden bird Flowers, get gold, and then add strength.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tomorrow, I must find out the flaws in the old baron.

Peggy said that the person who accepted the compliment was in the court, supporting the followers of Baron Darmark's court.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man was slightly embarrassed and thanked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Dragon Mairs, who are wonderful people, can manipulate the dead bodies with their minds and make them seem to be alive.
