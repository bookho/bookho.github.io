			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Frye finally waited for the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He vented the depression of the past few days, and his endless body made him work very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, Fran also quietly thanked the person who gave him a new life, although ugly, but alive, better than anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Fran is glad that now, not a hundred years later, he still lives in a familiar era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from their conversation, Fran noticed that he was just an experimental product of a big man, and sooner or later he would be destroyed. And those who are addicted to research have no morality. The midnight butchers a few years ago were what they did in order to find experimental materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of victims have become sacrifices for the whisperers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life belongs to oneself, and no one, even the worldly monarch and the gods of heaven, have the right to reaplessly harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am guilty of you." Fran thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last glimmer of the eternal cabinet flashed a few times and went out. Enough energy for every priest and mage to be squandered, leaving only a pile of worthless waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The destruction of the sacred objects, the power that supported the stone walls of the waterways disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supernatural battles have long shattered the structure of the stone, the entire waterway swayed like an earthquake, cracks spread like spider webs, gravel fell from the cracks This waterway will collapse at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo's hand grabs Fran's foot, and he screams wildly without reason. "After planning for more than a decade, success is in front of the gods." Actually, I was spoiled by an experimental white mouse that you don’t understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these words, Leo is aging a lot, dry The hair turns into a powder, and the large, bulky age spots make the skin dark brown and dull, and time is the most luxurious thing for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, or call you Angtes, I learned your name in a conversation with others." Fran looked at the old man with pity. "For the holy things, the gods, these incredible things, I do not know anything, but there is a law of the highest in the world: crime, that is, to be punished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got rid of the hand of the dying old man, Run outside the waterway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am God, who can judge the gods in this world?" Rio laughed hoarsely, in horror and miserable laughter, like centuries The rock that has been eroded by the wind is turned into a pile of dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time has completely abandoned this madman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the hall, Fran met with Ma Tida, madly believing that the girl was in a semi-conscious state, and her slender fingers were still shaking unconsciously, as if trying to catch Not far from the sword. The closed eyes and the bleak face without blood make the girl lose the coldness of the cold, like the juveniles that are dying in the cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the old-fashioned temperament, the girl is still a child under the age of sixteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the costumes full of religious plots, Fran recognizes that the girl is not an enemy and should be a member of the Knights stationed in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran sandwiched her under her arm and ran towards the water outlet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the light that penetrated the sluice was visible, Mattida was awakened by the bumps, she blinked in confusion, immediately horrified, just a thrilling battle ended? Who is running with him now? Is the holy warrior coming to aid? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida turned his neck effortlessly, and it was a large piece of pale skin with pinholes and stitching marks, unusually thick arms, and From the gap between the robes that are casually tied at the waist, if there is a swaying one of the stuff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that she is aware of her awakening, and the man looks down and reveals a distorted expression - Matilda is not sure if the expression is a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you awake? You can go out if you insist on it." The red-eyed monster said that the sound was unexpectedly pure, a standard Byron accent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl realized that the battle had not ended yet. She fell into a more terrible situation. The monster actually touched her waist with her hand, and her face had to lick the ugly skin without temperature, and the half. Naked, man-only, black and disgusting stuff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is destined to sacrifice to the kingdom of heaven, and the body of ice and jade is being tarnished by evil heresy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl began to struggle desperately, the monster was so strong that she could not get rid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please don't be afraid, I know that my appearance is very scary, I will explain it when I escape the waterway." The monster tightened his arms again. Noisy, otherwise we all have to die here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would rather die." Matilda finally touched the dagger in her boots and tied it to the monster's waist. On, the monster screamed, dropped her, and made a few rolls on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Fran screamed at the wound and angrily blamed. Soon, he discovered another magical part of the body, the big hole that was cut. It will heal in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Monster, you should stay in hell." Matilda sat on the ground and pointed at Fran with a dagger. The girl knew that this magic dagger was Her secret weapon, in the powerful creature, as long as a small wound is drawn, it will start from the inside of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this talks, it should be a monster with humanoid intelligence, nothing at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it the devil that was summoned from the endless abyss by heresy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitida made up his mind that if he could not resist, he would end his life with a dagger and die, better than being invaded by a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she thought, the devil rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl chanted prayers sacredly, reversed her wrists, and inserted her chest, and she was ready to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge shadows and roaring, like the wings of death, covered her, shaking for a long time, only slowly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time on the chest, no longer advances, the blade of the dagger is smashed by the devil's palm, a large piece of slate falling off the top of the head , kneeling on its spine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
