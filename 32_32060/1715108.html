			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. The continuous grayish black began to occupy the sky, the street lights in the streets and lanes brightened up, it was the hour of dinner, and the small square was quiet for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, good lady, it’s dark, if you feel satisfied, I should go back, night is the busiest time.” The cheap smoke that had just been drawn was thrown to the ground and stepped out with the sole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman suddenly felt a little scared. Her temporary employer looked unfair, her face was bleak like bleached paper, her lips trembled, her hands hugged her head. In the combination of the face, in the dark, it really looks like an unintentional ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say...say ok, one hundred." She stammered reminded, swearing to leave as soon as she got the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei slightly returned to the point of the gods, slowly moved his pockets, and randomly took out two large denominations and handed them over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that after ten seconds, the girl did not feel that the other person took the money and raised her head in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a flustered face, and I’m staring at my palm, then I’m falling over Crushed stone on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...you are really Anmei! Ghost... Come back from hell... Don't... don't come to me..." She frightened and waved I want to scream out loudly, but my throat seems to be stunned by fear, only whispering a few hoarse voices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What do you say, I am not the weak woman who was murdered?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Injury... Scars..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scars? An Mei’s left palm does have a thin pink scar, several centimeters long, extending from the palm to the aorta of the wrist. Like a knife that was hurt, she can’t remember when it happened. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie Li almost cried, she just wanted to make extra votes, not psychologically prepared to deal with ghosts, "She... her palm has exactly the same scar, I still remember that it was broken on the plate that day. There was still a lot of blood..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is about to surface, and the misty tulle will be smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the puzzler has already spoken incoherently, and even fled to the square to escape, desperately want to leave the ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stay! I still have a lot to ask you! I used to call Anmei? I am really a woman in the story?" Brain cellar, and find the truth Xin Yue has seriously affected the girl's calmness. She forgot her identity, such as dealing with powerful and powerful enemies. Habitually exerting the power of the "Red Prosecutor", picking up black waves in nothingness, like the dexterous squid tentacles, entangled the slender waist of the escaper, and dragged it backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a mage, the shield may be able to resist this steel whip attack, but the puzzler is just an ordinary bar girl, not too late to scream, just The mud fell to the ground, between the head and the hard slate. A terrible collision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When An Mei turned her over. The girl has fainted, and her mouth and nose are slowly flowing, and the breathing is getting weaker. Not far from death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of a person is so fragile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! How am I so impatient?" An Mei slammed the ground, the assassin's nature and the old days in the dark world, let her The murder of murder, no intention to kill an innocent person, did not let the girl's heart guilty, she only regretted that she did not calmly induce the other party to speak more detailed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty meters away, in the flower garden of a half-man-high shrub square, the buzzing rate was heard, and the detection ability of the blush prosecutor immediately captured two people. Type of creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a couple in love, probably when it’s just dark. Sneak into this quiet place to be close, may be the sound of the fear of the relatives, causing their curiosity, so they looked around and unfortunately witnessed everything that happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really didn't see anything." It was a young man with a fluffy beard on his lips, trying to keep his girlfriend behind him. Shouting, wanting to defend, and hope that pedestrians passing by will hear it. Good to find a patrol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei is not willing to do this kind of unnecessary killing, but for an assassin walking in the dark, it is the biggest taboo to be kind and to forgive witnesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents of Fedu, no one noticed that in the corner of the city, there have been three consecutive murders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hotel room, Zall Law touched his forehead with distress. When the girl just came back, he found out that the other party was not right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under questioning, An Mei reluctantly told her crimes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, good girl, I said, don't make sensational cases, our biggest protection is to be in the dark, otherwise people will smell any clues. It will only bring disaster." He walked angrily and blamed, anxious about this kind of thing not under control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All said, it was an accident, I didn't want to kill, and I can guarantee that no one would find out that I did it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no accident in this world, only coincidence is inevitable. I want to know why you want to kill a woman who has never been masked, so that he was forced to get rid of it." Two more innocent witnesses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it unmasked? She knows me more than I know myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not my fault, I’m not stupid, I’m being blamed by a man who has to protect me.” An Mei doesn’t want to continue to entangle on this topic. She walked towards the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your behavior is not logical, I think..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threshold is closed Interrupted the words of Zall Law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Mei lay down on the bed and sighed, she really didn’t think about killing at Feidu, but she was like a blood curse, she wanted to close her hand. Can't take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Golden Goose Tavern, Bar Girl, Grandma, and a husband named Freire, damn, I just can’t remember! If that’s what the person said The whole family encountered the door, then why am I still alive, what happened to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headache is like blasting, the girl hesitated for a while Still twisted the bottle and swallowed the medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you stop taking medicine immediately and overcome the addiction, you have to adjust it for a while before you can fully recover. I can't lose it if I can't keep calm." The force of survival."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought, then changed the soaked underwear and went out to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady named Jasmine provided a lot of clues to trace the past, maybe she could check it out. Start with the Golden Goose Tavern and see if I can recognize who is coming. Before going to sleep, the murderer decides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Fryer can't use Peggy's power to find An Mei, he wants to protect his wife instead of murder, only by reasoning Exploring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Logic, in the combination of criminals, the leader is usually the one with the most outstanding strategy, so among the two, the drow law should be "The leader of all actions." He sighed. "If I were a drow, I was the first to find a safe and secure place to stay. It was a stupid idea to expose myself on the street. It would not be Cheap small hotels, where the sailors and foreign bitters care, are usually the focus of the patrol. They should be looking for a high-end restaurant that is expensive for rent and has a pocket-sized middle class."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is inferred to be correct, but the fee is not a small township. There are at least dozens of restaurants that meet the requirements. It is obviously sloppy and slow to find a room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He envisioned several ways to find people, but they all need a lot of people who can keep secrets. It’s one thing to plan their minds. I can't do it myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the noon the next day, he racked his brains and did not come up with the best method. When the personal maid, Lilian, pushed in the door, she saw Fran. Sitting at the table, the cigarette butts in the ashtray almost came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, do you need to eat?" The beautiful interrogation was respectfully asked, while at the same time secretly, her surveillance target was slightly embarrassed today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will eat it in the room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hostess told you to let you I have to go downstairs and have lunch together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peji and his group still live in the city government villa that they have visited, and she plans to stay for a week, then Return to the Black Swan Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the dishes were as rich as ever, Fran talked a little with Missy, cut the grilled poultry on the plate and glanced at today's newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Feidujiao reported on the second edition of the homepage that the murder occurred in the Goose Square last night. The victims were three people. The police are currently blocking the scene. , mining investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...

The police have not disclosed whether there are eyewitnesses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is an appendix to the report. It is the colleague of the deceased. "We all call her jasmine. It is really sad..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden Goose, "Jasmine...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan vaguely remembers this girl, a friend who was still a wife during her time as a woman.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; However, Fran did not like her very much, An Mei had helped her, wanted to let Lili find a job, or put a stall, but after she took the money, she quickly spent shopping and gambling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't be angry, she is my good sister, can help." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You helped her, but she didn't value the opportunity to leave the business." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is that?
