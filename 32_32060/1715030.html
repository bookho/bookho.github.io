			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Fran Fryer, this is a name buried deep in the heart, belonging to the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, in the golden corner of the Gulf of the city, there was a cruel murder, a citizen who had worked as a prosecutor, and the family suffered three Murder, and the former prosecutor, and his wife, have not even found the capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspector Lyme of Feidu, vowed to send the murderer to the gallows, to justice for his friends, but has never found clues, even received The pressure exerted on the head, in the end, can only be sad and sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of time, Freire’s case, this sensation, has become a case of people’s talks, has been quietly memorized by memory, only in the patrol The archives room of the hall is a stack of dust and cobwebs at the bottom of the file. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s a criminal or an accomplice, a detective who investigated the case in the past, or a boring guest who had been tempted to analyze the original reason, could not think of it. The dead man, who has returned to the world, is using his own way to punish the old enemy with the gloom of justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most intimate people can't know his past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when I heard the name ringing in my ear, in a moment, Fran felt terrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a kind of secret that is walking in the darkness, suddenly bright, and most concealed, and unexpectedly panic under the white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan’s muscles are so tight that the bones are squeaking under the thriving force. Before turning his head, he passed countless possibilities in his heart, but immediately, he opened his eyes in surprise and his tone became excited. "Heaven, it is you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp I don’t know when, there was a thin middle-aged man on the cushion of the carriage. The hair was unkempt like a bird's nest, and the moustache on the lips had not been taken care of for a long time. It was a bit like a waste of wild grass. The long white pullover on the body, wrinkled, apparently the night before, was used as a nightgown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pullover, a light gray cloak with a hood, a fine gold thread on the cloak, and a paint with magical substances, Sketch out the complicated patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned what I learned when I was a part-time assistant at the Master Tadang. Fran can recognize that those are composed of magical patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mysterious temperament cloak is matched with the pullover that the store manager or the small bureaucrat can wear, but it looks Funny, but this old friend is famous for not trimming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magicly explore, day and night alchemy experiments. It is indeed a very energy-intensive thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a few years ago, he was a lot older, and his eyes were sprinkled with fine wrinkles. The sound is also a lot old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"William..." Fran’s lips shook, and the joy of his old friend’s reunion made him forget that he was in the carriage and stood up in excitement. The head hit the top of the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" From the description of the old liar in Bury, I guessed it was you, and sure enough!" William Master is equally excited, non-stop Squatting, straight, "Even if alcohol will delay a whole day of meditation. We must also drink a few cups."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I have a few at home Bottle of authentic brandy." Fran said, but the joy did not dilute his vigilance, "Berry? Who is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character is extremely swindler, and it was really a friend who was in the past. If it wasn’t the latest experimental material, it just lacked the important fine gold, and the market could not buy it, I would not come to Tantin... ..." mentions Bury. William immediately revealed the expression of the victim, and he screamed incessantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The full name is Berry Roche? The court priest who is deeply trusted by the Emperor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but whoever trusts him, bad character is not good, I guess the treasures and magic materials collected by the Emperor's Curry are looted by the old liar."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He mentioned me to you?" Fran's eyebrows jumped slightly, and he closed the window. "Go to my house, come first, talk about the rest." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage slowly moves around the martial-ridden place, from the other side of the Bull Plaza, towards the Regal area adjacent to the Silver Avenue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, William chattered about his recent experience. He was near the border in the south, near a small town that could not be found on the map, bought a piece of forest land, seclusion, and studied variants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even met a very rare Druid to discuss the possibility of transforming nature into Arcane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the legendary metamorphosis dragon, or the Minotaur, the lion, is still a mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I have made a breakthrough in alchemy." The mage pointed at the cloak on his body, "unchanged into a mouse, no need to remember again." And, when transforming the body shape, it can also transform the carry-on clothing into the mouse fur, thus eliminating the shackles of the naked body when it is restored."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He patted the chest and promised, "When you get the fine gold, I will help you rebuild the ring. Well, according to the scientific engineers, this is called system upgrade... Hey, what about your ring? "William found out at this time that Fran's fingers were bare and there was no magic ring." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan smiled and looked like he was listening to the Master’s words, but his thoughts had drifted to other places until William asked him again. Come to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have encountered an attack, it seems that the ring and the body melt together." He felt the carriage stopped moving forward, "get home, wait for me." Explain it to you in detail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coachman blinked in surprise and two people came down from the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t remember at all, there are also strangely dressed passengers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But due to professional cautiousness, he only sneaked in his heart, and after leaving the car, he left doubtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody at home, when I went out early in the morning, Fran sent Secelia back to the Heihe Hotel. Today, the troupe did not perform, and Baru took it. The whole group of people, out of the city, soothing the daily rhythm of intense and busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran took out a bottle of wine and taste from the cupboard, which was a good white wine, and found some snacks for the sake of the wine. After doing a cup, he Stroking the left middle finger, the uplifting old man, selectively tells the story of his own journey after leaving the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
