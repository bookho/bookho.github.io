Golden Horn Bay's giant boxing cockroach Kerry root chewed the tooth flower, stout The arm smashed a leg of lamb, accompanied by mushroom sauce, sucking the delicious bone marrow inside. He was happy to enjoy everything that deserves good taste, beauty, food and power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Most of the finances are firmly in her hands, and at least one-third of the members of the gang are loyal to her," said Little Beas. "Not to mention that she has a close relationship with the officials of Tantin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, if you don't do it, the whole gang will fall to the little fox and the crow sooner or later." In the palm of your hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To do it, you have to solve all the troubles at once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Now is an opportunity. The most elite gunmen under the Lauetta are out of work, the losses are heavy, the power is greatly reduced, and, most likely, the crows also traveled to the south."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this news reliable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shawea’s hard-boiled pig, now stands firm. The news is He came from him." The giant boxer said with hatred that because Shawei was saved by the crow, he was always dissatisfied with Kregan’s plan to completely master the gang. This is a big fist. Capacity , So let him With the aim to die, Javert dispatched to the southern snatch new smuggling channels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawei is a barbarian, has no brains, only has a good strength, but he relies on the courage to dare to kill, actually grabbed a site from the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I won’t be deceived." "He is with you, the right arm that I brought out from the western countryside. That guy is a loyal person who is straightforward. I don't know how to lie and deceive. If it's not because of the crow, I really can't bear to count him." Kregan is a bit frustrated, but this sultry gangster will not cancel his thoughts because of small emotional fluctuations. The fox lost a voter and asked Shawei to help. Inadvertently revealed that the crow was on the way to the south. The person I stayed with at Shawei heard the news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, all the way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the swaying lights, Kregan’s face showed a trace of embarrassment. "In any case, the gangs are powerful now. Those mysterious dragons are also disappearing. The crows are no longer able to find him. Now there are under the eyes. An opportunity. What are I waiting for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter ,Please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Freyle’s reins of the wind cut, stopped at the fork of a road, wearing a double-breasted hazel knight suit Black knee-length riding boots with knee-length knees and wind-proof glasses with light-colored frames on the face. After leaving the city, because Quasimodo's appearance is too noticeable, and Tantin is familiar with the name of the gentleman, in order to avoid being detected, he transformed into a handsome young man's face, and put a fake beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Nantes obediently followed the half-length of the horse. Fran took two horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a rotation around the clock to ride the Mercedes-Benz, now is the fourth day of the road, whether it is a horse or a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All are exhausted and physically exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially cutting the wind, because running fast, Fran mainly rides it on the road, hangs down to the horse's abdomen, and prevents the back from being worn by the saddle. They have been drenched with dripping sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little rest day, add some more clothes by the way." Fran thought, although his heart has already flown to the south, looking for the whereabouts of his wife. . But the speed is not up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the secret letter of Lauvita, it was mentioned that An Mei was injured and retreated. It is very likely that he has returned to the secret base of the movie king, but Fran is still looking forward to the line, hoping she has not left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as there is a little chance, Fran will never miss it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a high-profile sign at the fork, and the wooden arrows are marked with red and prominent red names, indicating where each road leads. Fran looked at it and guided the wind to the right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vigoro is a large-scale market town with a permanent population of more than 10,000 people, with a short history, whether it is a clean road or a building The scale is not inferior to the real city, and it has a more comfortable rural style than the hustle and bustle of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran followed the winding stone road and came to the town at about 8 o'clock in the morning. The locals were not interested in a rushing passer. This is too common. These passing businessmen or passengers always have a gust of wind. Land, come and go, leave no trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the town of West, there is a small two-storey hotel with many decorative and bonsai in the pot, slightly to the left. The location stands on the root sign: the old horse hotel, where there is wine, meat and room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is what Fran is in need. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hotel is a family business, from the boss to the receptionist, is a family, so it is very diligent to the guests, "accommodation or dining?" The receptionist is a yellow hair The young man, he took the reins of two horses and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you are lucky, and the last room, Otherwise, you have to go to Zhendong, there are also hotels, but the food is not as good as ours." The young man does not waste any chance to fight against competitors. "I recommend you to taste my family's specialties, the real chef's craft. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Casually."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You please come in, eat first, I will go right away." "Clean up the room," said the young man, then shouted at the door. "Daddy, there are guests, go get ready for your good food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meals The taste is good, there are apple pie, fried fish fillets and specialties: a local famous snack, a pie made with cucumber, cheese and minced chicken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was on the second floor, clean and neat, soft and duvet and pillow tempted Fran, he took off his coat and tightened the curtain of the window to avoid The sun disturbed sleep. When he leaned on the pillow, he quickly fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The receptionist and son of the hotel, just fed the horse and rubbed his hand from the back court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a petite guest standing in front of the door, so he went up and asked, "Mr.... No, Miss, accommodation or dining?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guest turned his face to him, "Accommodation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man stunned, what a beautiful girl, the soft blond hair flashed in the sunlight, the green eyes were like jade, the body was slim, the girl was pure, and the charm of a mature woman The dress is very casual, yellow jacket and tights, but the left hand hangs on the waist side, from the cuff can see a thick white bandage, tied to the wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Accommodation." The girl repeated the words again, and the receptionist returned. He stuttered and said, "Hold... sorry, there is no room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it, I will find another one." The girl turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss, there is room in the town, you turn left along the road, and you will pass through the central plaza." He shouted behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." The girl turned back and smiled at him, the swaying smile. Let the young man remorse and think, "Hey, if our family can have more room, or less guests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ann Coleion thinks Find a comfortable place and have a good rest, especially taking a shower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is on her way back to the organization’s secret base, her arms are getting more and more serious, and the samurai’s thrilling sword is mixed with some very powerful force. Let the wounds slow down and get better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary drugs simply don’t work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the power of the Dragonfly Prosecutor. It is also impossible to expel the damn energy in the scars, and it can only make it worse. She is helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole arm is now numb and loses consciousness. As if she is no longer part of the body, she would have liked to stay in the south to find another chance to fight the enemy again, but now it seems that she can only go back and let her brother find a way to cure the injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the wilderness shuttled for several days, the power of the dragon vein was mainly placed in the defense against the deterioration of the wound, making her speed slower and slower, maybe it should be horse? Although she is not good at riding, she is better than the rest of her legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First find a place to settle down. Add physical strength, wait for the evening, buy or grab a good horse in the town." The girl calculated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran had slept for ten hours, and when he got up, it was already dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He washed a little and enjoyed a dinner. After paying the money, he asked the boss when he left. "Is there a shop selling travel goods in town?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can go to the open square in the town. There is a night market in the evening, where you can buy anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;What can be bought is obviously exaggerated, but the goods are quite large, filled with stalls selling all kinds of groceries, many people, Fran first parked the horse on the side of the square, tied in paint Black railings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple walked in front of him, the girl took the boy’s arms, they stopped in front of a booth, and the canvas of the wooden frame was covered with colorful The hair clips and case are coated with thin silver cuffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selecting a heart, bargaining, the boss complained that he did not make any money, and smiled and handed the cufflinks to the boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The clothes are hot, and I will sew them for you, men, you have to dress up mentally."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would rather buy you a hairpin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next time, wait until you receive a salary and say."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said the same thing last month, but still buy cufflinks now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open-air plaza The ground was very dim, but the girl smiled brightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very nostalgic scene, he stared, in Feidu, many times, his wife, just like this, relying on him, everything Think for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ann Corleone just came out from the hotel where he went to bed, before asking the staff in the store, where there are horses to sell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you have to wait for the market day, when the merchants who sell the animals come to the town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;No way, I have to get one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, I saw only a few old horses pulling the goods. The hair was gray and weak, and she wanted to find a better one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, a man just jumped off the horse and tied her back to her. There were two horses, one of which made the girl’s eyes shine. The horse is tall and beautiful, the wings are thick, and the curve of the body is very beautiful. At first glance, the blood is quite good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is the owner? Where are you going? Have the opportunity to start? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s not difficult to solve all the people in front of the eyes like a devil, it makes no sense to create panic and slaughter, which is not inconsistent with the assassin. Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of girls strolling through the night market walked in, just blocking the sight of Ann. After the crowd passed, she stretched her neck and looked around, but could not find the owner of the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't matter, anyway, she wants horses instead of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl whispered playfully, the dagger in the sleeve, slipped gently into the palm of her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran wants to buy some fast-food dried meat and soy-fed soybeans, as well as flint and fire for fuel. The goods are mixed and incomplete, he has to go around. Square, slowly buy. Unconsciously, he went very far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a big ticket, please wait, I will find some change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Okay, please hurry up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a lot of time to change. When he squeezed out from the crowd, he couldn’t help but close his eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Nantes still stayed in the same place, but the wind was gone, and the ropes were cut off by the sharps and thrown on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one noticed the theft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rode on the southwest of Luo, ran two rounds in the town along the road, did not find, had to give up. Alarm or continue to search. It takes a lot of time. Fran didn't want to go to the south because of a horse, delaying the business, the sooner he should find his wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the wind is worth 100,000 Caesar, it will not be able to get a little bit of news from An Mei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the town, Luo Nantes runs briskly, horseshoes tap, let the road Gravel splash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road leading to the road twists and turns, did not run for five minutes, Fran faintly saw the night below a few hundred meters away. There is a knight in the same road... and so on. It seems to be a thief! The saddle under his mount has a bright red silk cloth, which is being picked up by the oncoming wind. That is the cut wind, damn thief! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran’s handcuffs slammed, ran all the way, but the distance was farther and farther, just the old Klezdale’s Hummer’s South West, how could it run? Champion in Marseille. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can only watch the thief, riding a stolen horse, disappearing into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't mind losing a horse, but you let me delay the most important thing, day. Don't let me meet you again, otherwise ..." Fran vented toward the night sky and slammed the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind brought gunshots, and screamed in the distance, and laughed happily. Her awful mood seemed to be much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A really good horse, the speed is very fast, the oncoming wind messes up the girl's hair. The shadow of the trees on the side of the road, constantly retreating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She patted the mount’s neck lovingly, and it was such a joy to ride a horse and run in the wind to make the original owner feel bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An decided to change the original idea, instead of returning to the organization, he immediately threw the horse away, but kept it for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, give you a name, you will be my land in the future, um..." The girl thought, maybe there is something wonderful about it. The consonance, she snapped a finger, "Run so fast, as if the wind will be cut, I will ask you to cut the wind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the fork, the girl squinted at the street sign, indicating that the wind was cut and heading north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten minutes later, Fran let Luo Nantes stop, the roads extend in all directions, he can not tell which direction the thief ran, and sighed and put away the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should turn left to get to the main road to the southern front." Fran looked at the girl who had stopped crossing the street sign, patted the horse and turned to the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two identical but staggered figures, each moving in the opposite direction, gradually drifting away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive text version of this work 16k novel network, can not be reproduced without permission, excerpt, more recent and fastest chapter, please visit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early dawn and the light curtains on the window roots are softly intertwined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Weita counts the bullets in the magazine, she leaves one, the gun's wheel is quickly swung, and then closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have to suffer more to tell the truth? I take you with you, do you really think that you have gained trust?" The girl in the eyes said cruelly, "If Kregan wants to change, he will first contact you with this spy, get the information of my current situation, stare at you early, never reveal it, just treat you as a gang." "Time and place alarms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss, I really haven’t betrayed the organization..." A gangster’s gunman was squatted on the chair, his mouth twitching He also smeared the thick blood, and he painfully argued, "You don't listen to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An answer is his gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still up to four chances, maybe, even one chance is gone. Do you want to gamble?" She smiled and said that there was a cold smile in her smile. chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If... If I said, would you let me go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I promise, I won't bother you any more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The giant fist old dog... No, Kregan knows that Mr. Raven will meet you and has already dispatched The killer, ready to go all out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, the specific whereabouts of the killers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
