			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The King of Shadows can have today's scale, fully benefiting from Ann's detection capabilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost 70% of the people in the organization were discovered by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the girl is just a good human radar, it will be a joy, but she is really growing too fast, is a dragon, once in a hundred years genius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the most senior dragons think she is a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are really my sister." Joe thought, the whole organization, perhaps the whole world, except Joe himself, no one knows the origin of this cheap sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You killed my grandmother, killed my husband, ruined my family, the despicable murderer, I want to use the most vicious language humans can tell." Come and curse you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe Corleone still remembers that before the hypnosis and drug control, the girl of Feidu was like a bottle of iron in her eyes. flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one day, she loses control... Just by imagination, Joe Corleone feels a deep chill, spreading along the spine . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Her current ability, can not be divided by the usual level, and a few days ago, just leaving the manor to walk, can pick a new dragon Come back, is this just a coincidence?” Joe Corleone felt that the whole heart had been tightened. “Is it... she is really legendary...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; In the secret inheritance of Longmai, there has always been such a legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ride, the Guijue, the king, there is another supreme level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Dragons, whether they are already awake or have potential, will be intentionally or unintentionally brought together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is the Pope of the Dragon, the king of the Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the Shadow King is almost gnashing his teeth. "Is it impossible, in this world, is there really blood of God?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the eve of the sergeant, Fran returned to Tantin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came out of the ceremonial carriage, stepped on the red carpet that stretched all the way to the steps. Slightly stopped the pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From yesterday, there was a sense of tiredness that invaded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the side effects of the Holy Power happen again?" Fran thought. He hopes to stick to the complicated ritual process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The age of the Cathedral of Tantin is almost the same age as Byron. It is not open to general communicators. In fact, in tradition, it is the coronation of the emperor to accept the church. And the place where the kingdom nobles performed the honour ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a rigorously strong Brazilian-style building, with thick walls and a dome-covered format. It and other parts of Byron are known for their elegance. The biggest difference compared to churches is that there are very few pillars that support weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail arches, buttresses, straight walls, and wall panels share the weight. At the top of the church, it is the largest dome of all buildings in Tantin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four towering towers. Standing tall and straight on the four corners of the church. In the middle of the tower, there is a suspended milky white corridor connected to the main hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most intriguing qualities of the Cathedral of Constantine. It is a window. Under the large and small domes, there is a series of curtains inlaid with colorful glass and pointed windows. The color is radiant and radiant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windows where the position is not important, there will be a layer of shaded panels behind the glass so that the interior is not too bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory, please come with me." A ceremonial officer in charge of the road said whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his voice just falling, the trombone raised the instrument. Accompanied by a long horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the steps, arranged on both sides, wearing a gorgeous armored knight, under the command of the leader, pull out the ceremonial sword wrapped in silk and gold thread. The sword is in the air. The ceremonial officer took a half step ahead of Fran, and at the top of the steps, in front of the middle hall, he bent down. Retreat to the right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another ceremonial official wearing a robes greeted him. He was as deep as a guide, and he held a shawl embroidered with three fur edges. "The Royal Ceremony Hall is for you, Sir Alex."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan took the shawl and placed it outside his attire, then continued to walk inside the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is about to become an empire's count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember that a long time ago, I also had the idea of ​​reviving my home, Viscount Freire, Count Freire, and even Marquis of Freire, let myself With the loved ones, the glamorous and alive is alive.” He thought, “But what does it mean for me now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am the Baron Oston of the Administrative Bureau, congratulations to you," Sir Alex Ferguson, I am the deputy director of the Finance Department, and I would like to express my gratitude to you on behalf of the Director and myself." A banquet, I hope that the Earl will be able to visit." With the footsteps, the people on the courtroom greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hypothetical." Fran appropriately showed gratitude and thought in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze, sweeping through the hall, the dignitaries who came to see the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I admit that among these people, there are also many people who truly adhere to virtue, but more are those who love rights over morality. Hypocrites." He thought, "I have never lived in their hands. The gorse is just their representative. Even without Leinschmann, there will be another name and another family, doing the same thing. "Trouble the justice of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time Fran looked at the corner, sitting in a thin man wearing a hooded robe, nodding his head and smiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the wizard William, he also came to attend the ceremony. These days, William has been staying with his old friend Bury to discuss the experiments of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Master often calls Berry an old liar, their personal relationship is very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franland nodded to William and walked toward the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
