			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as everyone looked around the train and left, the west suddenly sounded a screaming alarm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“呜—————————呜—————————”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone can't help but stay where they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned out to be the highest level of warning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter first responded, "Your Majesty, please go back to the castle to avoid the danger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; And what surprised Roland was that Tilly and Ashes quickly moved closer to him, with the extraordinary one blocking the two behind them, and Tilly grabbed his wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrist suddenly came with a cold metal touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his head and saw that the ring on Tilly’s finger had flowed to fill the blue light. Obviously, as long as the situation is wrong, she will take her direct flight. Lower mining area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know why, at this critical moment, he felt a little absent-minded, and more attention fell on the master of the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s different from the unreserved trust of the nightingale. He knows that Tilly does not really regard him as a brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lie is always difficult to get through the seven beautiful people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if she would call herself in person, it would be just a matter of maintaining the existing relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the relationship between the two has always been like a layer of tulle, which is too vague to define, let alone the ashes have been cold and not hot to him - - Although the Liangzi in the palace has nothing to do with him, this black pot can't be said even if you want to explain it. Because he deceived the first, it was not easy to ask for anything, but now he could not help but feel the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps for Tilly, even if it is not a bloody person, simply being an ally is enough to be trusted and affirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it’s too close to the border wall, please leave now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Guards, where are the guards?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All come over to open the way for you!" At this time, other people reacted and shouted loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the alarm in mid-air reverberation, the scene was quite chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infected by the tension of the crowd, Roland finally returned, he could not help but frown... Can the defending army discover the trace of the devil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks west of the North Slope Mine - now that Sylvie is in charge of the alert, the possibility of false positives is low, allowing the border guards to ring the loudest The alarm, in all likelihood, should be the devil is right. But are they not lacking red fog and are dormant? Or is it that the relic of Takira has brought in new supplies? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I really want to go to the wall to see it, but now the night is not there, the main force of the first army is still on the way home, or do not increase the burden of the defender it is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way down the mountain, he called Wendy and said, "No matter what happens to the wall, I will tell you immediately if I have any news."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," the latter's expression of dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi looks at the enemy closer and closer, and can’t help but secrete Out of the sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time she has seen the devil, but the pressure that the other party has brought her has always followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One, two, three, four, five, six - a total of six fearful beasts lined up, from the grassland direction to the no winter city. Under the observation of the Eye of Magic, every detail of the enemy is clearly identifiable. As Elx mentioned, not every beast is equipped with a madman, two of which are bundled with a bone-filled bone-shaped container, like a hummer that is responsible for carrying things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously they carried out this long-distance attack by carrying a sufficient amount of gas storage tanks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But...why is the devil attacking so quickly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shouldn’t stay around the ruins of the sacred veins, waiting for the arrival of the Red Moon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly let Hillvi feel that the first army quickly responded after hearing the alarm, and the artillery on the wall dropped the gun coat. Team soldiers also entered the battle zone. If the enemy does not suddenly change direction, the two sides will encounter after half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Sylvie, the person over there asked, if the enemy intends to invade the city, can you figure out the neighborhoods they might pass?" Wei said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to facilitate the transmission of the enemy, Roland moved the prototype of the hand-cranked phone in the backyard of the North Slope Mountain to the wall, except for the line that goes straight to the Long Song Fortress. It is also the first telephone in the winter city to be put into practical use. It was only made by the line chief, and the other end of the phone could only be placed at the entrance of the third side of the city. Therefore, in addition to a special liaison, Hilli also arranged two gods to protect the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Route 5 or 9", Sylvie wiped the sweat from his hand, "but they may also go towards the square, where The people have not been completely evacuated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the fear of the beasts into the market, the consequences are simply unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand," the guard repeated the microphone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Hillvi’s voice suddenly changed. "They are climbing up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Is it going to cross the city wall?" The guards were also nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the speed of the beast is also falling, and people on the wall should be able to see them directly!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has not fallen, and the gunshots have been faintly heard in the handset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers who boarded the battle of the city wall were undoubtedly the elite of the first army. They basically participated in the snow mountain exploration trip. They did not show confusion when facing the devil. color. Several teams fired alternately while maintaining a low shooting speed, and none of the brains shot all the bullets in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Hilli quickly found the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to hit a target in the air, much more difficult than knocking down an evil beast or a squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no signs of falling, and the soldiers simply don’t know how to adjust the angle. After several rounds of shooting, the beast is unharmed and has approached one hundred and fifty from the wall. The distance around the meter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their height has also climbed to more than 100 meters, the first army soldiers must be raised the gun to target the enemy, although the gunshots are dense, still Did not get any results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the beast stopped moving forward and hovered in the air like a giant bat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arm of the madman also swells quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Sylvie couldn't help but scream, "Let them evacuate the wall!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"What?" A guardian, "Evacuation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it was too late, the devil immediately cast a bone spear in his hand, four The white shadow descended from the sky, and the blink of an eye went through the unobstructed soldiers on the wall. Once the blow came from the air, the earthen wall raised by the lotus would lose its meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the enemy did not continue to attack - the madman after the arm shrank, issued a series of strange screams, and after dropping a few hides, Going back to the grassland when it turned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack came quickly and ended quickly. After a while, the devil's figure disappeared below the skyline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
