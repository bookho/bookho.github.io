			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰砰砰."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day has just been bright, not too long, it will come from outside the house Knocked at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goode, didn't you get up? We should go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get it right! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gude drank the last hot porridge, wiped his mouth and looked at the girl who was still busy packing the bed. "Then I set off." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up, "I really need to go without me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said Many times, you are too young, there will be no work for you.” Goode is impatient, “Hold it – I know you have to say something about the wolf, but that... you still Want to keep doing it? Stay well, I will bring you a good meal at noon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s eyes are bright, "popcorn -" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too expensive, I think the egg pancakes are good. Or do you not like the frying egg with two sides?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," she swallowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So don't run around, understand?" Goode finally groaned again, "Yes, what is your name?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rachel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should you call me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She was hesitant, but in the end she replied, "Brother... brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, let alone leak." The linen on the tight neck, pushing the door out of the earthen house, the warm atmosphere was suddenly dispelled by the cold wind, and the winter returned to his familiar appearance. Even so, the sights that come into view are full of vitality and vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of earthen houses stretched out like a wave of snow on the snow, looking up and seeing smoke and shaking people everywhere. The distant city is looming in the smoke, as if it is still in a deep sleep, and the place across the river has already revived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door that knocked on the door was the uncle and the mountain fruit who lived next door. They stood outside dozens of steps and urged, "What are you still doing?" Come on, hurry up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on!" He closed the door and ran towards the two on the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temporary residence is about four miles away from the center of Wudongcheng. The three must arrive at the central square before the new job is released. Fortunately, a solid stone road has been built along the Chishui River. Even if it is covered by snow, it can be very reassuring. There is no need for a mountain road to explore one step at a time. It can be reached in about a quarter of an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly, there are many more people around them - the size of the temporary residential area is beyond imagination, and Gourd has not even seen the end of it. According to the neighbor's uncle, the former Tuwu was built in the city, but as more and more people, these hills were moved outside the city. Because it is expanded every year, no one knows how many migrants it contains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one thing is certain, most of the people who joined the stone road from their place of residence are also directed at new jobs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any thoughts, what are you going to do next?" asked Bagi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should still be easy to live, like snow sweeping, deicing..." Shanguo holds the back of the head, "short time, money Fast, you can take two days of meals in a day, at least this winter is not afraid of hungry. Of course, the premise is that there is no better limited recruitment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limited Recruitment refers to special jobs where the number of people is limited, with a certain threshold and a lot of remuneration. The city is full of strange rules. For example, all employment announcements are related to the Executive Office, not from individuals; officials update the notice once a week, which is hundreds of people. Such scale and efficiency can be said to reshape the cognition of Goode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All recruitment is divided into three categories. In addition to limited recruitment, the other two categories are short-term recruitment and formal recruitment. The latter's compensation and scope of work are much broader, but unfortunately it is not an ID card. Certificates, migrants like them, can only choose short-term work to fill their stomachs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice of mountain fruit is reasonable, and the easy work is not high, but it can save energy to participate in the primary education class. If you pass the assessment, you can get the status of a formal resident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about you?" Shan Guo looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"High pay," Goode shrugged. "It doesn't matter if you are tired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Because he still has a mouth to raise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a new lover who moved to no winter city this winter, it is a blessing to have a shelter from the wind and rain. As for moving into those beautiful In the residential area, you can eat a meat every week, and he has not expected it yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that makes Goode somewhat regret is that the work released by the Executive Office has set a minimum age limit - sixteen, and Rachel has to go two more years. To meet the requirements. It’s hard to escape the fire pit now, and he can’t let the other party get stuck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't get too tired," Bucky reminded. "It's not cheap to go to a hospital for a cold weather."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, I am very good!" Goode patted the chest, this is not a boast, he was almost selected as a knight, if not born too bad If... "What are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I choose nothing, just to accompany you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Shanguo smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s that Goode quickly reacted, “Don't you already...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Haha, That's the way," Bagi smirked twice. "The foreman of the engineering six team looked at me and planned to call me into the official team. The new contract should be delivered in these two days."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's really...what's great!" Shanguo just came back. "If you officially recruit, the salary can almost double? Then you can take the down payment for a long time." In order to get the ID card, I will become a real winter city resident!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me read the book again, I definitely can't read it. "Bakiy waved his hand." And I have been here for almost two years. Now I only see the opportunity. I can only say that I am too stupid. You are so young, there are definitely more opportunities than me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were people who heard their conversations around, and they came together to make fun of the road, and the road was full of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Goode somewhat puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, getting an identity card is just to find a better job, but these people are like the other way around - become the lord or king The people who are in the same are all indifferent things, but in their speeches, this seems to be a matter of great pride, even more important than the work itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, the three people rushed to the Wintertown Square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been a group of first-timers here, but most of them are urban residents, and they do not compete with the migrants in temporary residential areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new announcement was posted on the south side of the square. From time to time, the devil walked to the side of the ancient Germans and asked, "Do you need to read it? Only ten copper." Eagle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, we recognize the word," Bagi also replied with a smile - of course, only three people in the three know and recognize Not complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, these guys...have this effort not to find a formal job," Goode muttered. "The salary is better than these bronze hawks." A lot more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are all college students, they should not be at work age." Shanguo looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
