			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord's castle in Bianbu Town was not built in its current location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground cave was encountered when the foundation of the stone wall was first buried. The ground suddenly collapsed and had to move the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those waterways that have been dug are mostly destroyed in the collapse, even if they are intact, they are abandoned due to relocation and reconstruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian often drilled in these tunnels when he was young. One day he accidentally discovered that there was a route that could be taken from a waste well to the well of the castle garden. in. Brian told the father about the news, but the result was hanged and smashed. The father warned him that he was guilty of the lord's castle, and that once he was discovered, he only had the weight of the upper gallows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian, who was scared, naturally did not walk through this waterway, but when people gathered together to drink and chat, he once boasted that he could have direct access. The skill of the castle. Now he regrets it very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Greyhound, there are nine people in the group. In other words, the entire patrol team was convinced by fierceness - to be able to do things for the king of the kingdom of the kingdom, Len, and such a rich return, I think that few people can withstand such temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waste well was in the place where it first collapsed, and it is still a wasteland. Brian was fiercely swayed with a sword and caught in the middle of the ranks. When I was a child, I was still a very spacious waterway. It is now very narrow. Because no one is passing through the year, and the water flow is diverted, vines grow in many places in the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who stabbed the Greyhound held the torch and walked to the front. He held the hatchet to remove the obstacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian is pretending to look like a road, but his heart is thinking about getting away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, in such a place where the action is extremely inconvenient, he has no possibility of escape. Only after waiting for the castle can you get a chance. What should I do then? Shouting two calls to your Royal Highness? No, no, it’s like a knife, you just need to raise your hand to get yourself. You must pull the distance first, otherwise his end will be the same as the gray dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the Greyhound, Brian’s eyes were a little bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lived here with himself before Bentham Town was established. The two of them almost played from small to large. Joining the patrol team was also from Brian’s idea. . Unexpectedly, he, like himself, was elected as the patrol captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian had been happy for him for a long time, because of the stuttering of the stray, the gray dog ​​has been underestimated. Now, he finally got the chance to be recognized - at least at the time, Brian thought so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the gray dog ​​fell, Brian screamed at the fierce, fiercely and ironically told him that everyone recommended himself and the grey dog ​​to be elected captain s reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fool, the patrol captain, but stays until the demon moon, igniting the bonfire alarm. Do not let you do, do you still have to take this risk?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is like a sharp blade that pierces the heart of Brian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original humility...the congratulations are hypocrisy, the real reason is so ugly. He showed a look of shock and despair, to cover up the anger that rushed out of his heart. It’s hard to forgive, Brian secretly bites his teeth, and someone must pay for it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dry underground waterway for about half an hour, everyone finally heard the sound of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means they are not far from their destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning a corner, the front is much more cheerful and can accommodate two people standing side by side. The person who walked at the top of the team said, "There is no road ahead, it is a shaft shaft."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" The fierce sword topped the top. ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell him to look up," Brian said in a cry. "We have arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
