			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you heard anything?" Itis looked to Brian, who was commanding the soldiers to lay out the line of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sound?" Brian stopped his work and looked around with a puzzled look. "No, Miss Itis, except for the sound of water, I didn't hear other sounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" She frowned. "Did I get it wrong?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of sound is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The horn is very turbid...very close to the sound of water," Tesston paused. "It seems to be from the south."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the direction the witches explored in depth - the raging dark river from the north South, disappeared into the dark hole, although there are some glowing strange plants on both sides, it can not be illuminated too far. The entire waterway is like an entrance to the abyss, engulfing everything she sees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is... I think it may be because we are located in the depths of the snow-capped mountains, can't see the sky, and even the lack of fire causes the illusion." Bryan With a thoughtful smile, "The soldiers who have been on the battlefield are fine. It is not surprising that you will feel nervous. If you feel uneasy, you will return to the passage with Miss Maggie."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Familiar look, and familiar words... Itis is not surprised by the gunman’s statement, although she is wearing a light leather armor and helmet at the moment, with a sabre around her waist, but Most people still regard her as a bystander sent by a town hall, or ... a pearl-like woman, just like her title, is beautiful and fragile. It is precisely because of this that care and courtesy along the way are very common. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that they don’t understand that the pearls produced by the North Giants are soaked from the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of fish, the blood of water beasts...and even the blood of fishermen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they can grow so big that they will create a round pearl of the size of a fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignore her appearance from the beginning, even taking her as an opponent, probably only Roland Wimbledon alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, but I still stay here better. If a person escaping back, isn’t it equivalent to losing his face to His Majesty’s City Hall?” But Itis She didn't show her thoughts. She smiled and declined Brian's proposal. This smile made the other person slightly stunned. After a while, she was embarrassed to look away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to kneel down and Barov will not mind this..." Brian coughed twice. "Just I don't quite understand why you want it." Follow the First Army to such a dangerous place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you will trust me," Itis said without any disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The battle of the gods you should have heard "Let's go," she said calmly. "When a battle to determine fate comes, it is impossible for Majesty to take care of all aspects of the war. He needs many officials to assist him in commanding the army. The army also needs people from the city hall to provide logistics. And security. At that time, would you believe in an official who fought side by side with you, or a guy who was sitting in the office and dealing with the manuscript all day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"..." Brian was so surprised that he took a moment to open his mouth. "You dare to say this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Tiss certainly knows what he is referring to, even a former patrol captain who is born and raised in the village can understand the meaning of this statement. It is absolutely intolerable to say that it is good to call the help of the commander, and that it is not easy to listen to the power of interfering with other lords. In particular, the knight who is under his command must be controlled by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the number of the first army has exceeded 5,000, and the Knights’ practice is obviously too backward – in fact, the staff formed by the team is such a The organization between the army and the city hall, the ultimate power still belongs to him, and the following command will only spread further. It was because of the idea of ​​Roland Wimbledon that Isis dared to say these words. She is not planning to join the staff, just want to expand her influence as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty... Did he agree?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I can only say that there is no objection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hey, isn't that equal to agree?" Brian said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Politics can't be understood this way," said Itis, "even the verbal promises are not necessarily counted before they become a provision, let alone It’s silence.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s so...” The gunman’s battalion couldn’t help but sigh, “Politics is really complicated.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, go further into the witches, learn about their abilities and personality, and live with them. It is also the purpose of this trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding, there is no doubt that a lot of energy is devoted to the witch. Without the construction of the winter city, the witch is inseparable. If you want to reach the peak of power, you will naturally need it. Fight for their support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the current situation is concerned, the plan is going very smoothly, probably because she is also a woman, and it does not attract rejection when it comes into contact with the witch. Barov's obstacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next batch should be a godly witch," Itis changed the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it should be that Miss Maggie can only transport five or six people at a time, and at least one tenth of a mile is needed to establish a sentinel." Ryan also cooperated with the return. "Right, where do you think the second machine gun is better?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The place with higher terrain... well, I remember that there was a rocky rock behind it..." Just as she turned and looked at the cave behind her, a glowing plant seemed to be distorted, as if something broke the stability of the air and the scene became blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had no time to warn her first army soldier, the air was once again distorted, and this ripple appeared behind the machine gun team members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, a soldier’s head rolled down his neck and his smile still solidified on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enemy!" Isis shouted at this moment, "The enemy is not visible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Almost at the moment of the voice just fell, two soldiers were pierced through the chest, the moment of blood splashing, the ripples also stained a little red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than one party! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought sharply, throwing a dagger with one hand, flying straight to the position where the first soldier fell, while pulling the sword to keep up - When the dagger was flying by an invisible object, her long sword pierced the roots of the ripple from another angle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis is clear that if you simply retreat, you will only be clipped before and after - there is only one bonfire here, and the only evidence of the enemy’s movements, if not Fire, they have no way to parry this almost invisible monster, so definitely can not easily escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack is the only chance to win when you can determine the enemy's position! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the sword sent a soft touch, like piercing the flesh, which made Itis happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not guess wrong, whether human or beast, the connection between the weapon and the body must be weak - just like the hand holding the sword, and the end of the claw, Once damaged, it will lose its offensive ability in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Itis was going to retire, a gust of wind swept her from the other side, and the speed even made her feel the chill of the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, this guy actually has two weapons? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of years of fighting experience made her subconsciously loose the right hand of the sword, while rolling to the ground, there seems to be something behind her. A long hair suddenly flew away, like a fading petal, and it was everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
