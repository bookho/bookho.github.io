			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland quickly estimated the size of the underground cave, with a football field at the bottom, surrounded by steep walls. The ramp connecting to this is just in the center of the mountain wall. There is a narrow stone ladder next to the hole, which extends downward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I guess this ladder is not built out by you," he crouched down and put the torch close to the ground. Under the illumination of the fire, the traces of the axe carving on the stone steps are very obvious, and there are still a lot of stone chips and dust in the marks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, Your Highness, when we found this, the stone steps were already there," Carter shrugged. "I guess this stuff has been around for decades." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or hundreds of years," Anna said suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think so too," Lightning nodded. "Bianyi Town has been established for only seventy years, and the stone ladder is unlikely to be related to the locals or the kingdom." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there anyone in the West a few hundred years ago?" Carter questioned, "The Grey Fort has not yet been established."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland patted the knight’s shoulder. “After four hundred and fifty years ago, there was a group of people who had been forgotten by history.” Then he raised the torch. “Let’s go, let’s go and see.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Army soldiers have surrounded the bottom of the cave in twos and threes. He walked with the knights and witches to the edge of the stone of punishment, only when standing at the foot of the stone pillar. I deeply felt the hugeness of the god stone. Open your arms, not one tenth of it, you must look up, you can see the top of it, the highest purple stone is close to thirty meters, almost equivalent to a **-storey house . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, the stone that can light itself is not a radioactive substance, but a fluorescent component, but the light of the stone of God is obviously irrelevant to both. - The former's light comes from the phenomenon of air ionization caused by the decay of the element itself, and the shorter the half-life, the greater the brightness. According to the brightness of the light, the soldiers who entered first will not be able to survive the ionizing radiation for a few minutes. The latter needs to be illuminated before it can be light. There is no light source in the depths of the ground, and it is obviously unable to support it to continuously emit cold light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also noticed that although the stone is a prismatic shape that is common in crystals, the surface has no crystallized lines, but is as smooth as flat glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the church, a thumb-sized stone of punishment can sell several golden dragons, like such a big one... can simply put the treasury of the four kingdoms They are all hollowed out." Carter couldn't help but feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Selling to the nobles to ruin the witch?" The night gave him a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, I didn't say that," the Cavaliers unconsciously removed their sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was the first to see the stone of this color, shouldn't it be white and transparent?" Lightning curiously looked at the stone pillar. "If you take a piece back, don't you have a candle at night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would rather put a dozen candles in the stuffy room and don't want to use it. To illuminate, "The nightingale embraces the chest with both hands. "For the witch, it is a cage, a shackle, an accomplice to the church! If there is no such damn stone in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, night sister, you won’t read the book anyway at night..." The little girl licked her lips and picked up the stone and looked at Roland. "I can take a piece back as a trophy for adventure." "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded. "If you don't dislike this stuff."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She picked up the stone in her hand and banged hard on the corner of the prism. She only heard a crack of "叮", the stone shattered, and there was no scar on the prism. Next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers couldn’t help but scream, “What’s the matter... Are the stones of God’s punishment not fragile and fragile?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe this light is different," Lightning smashed the stone in his hand, and took out the shackles from his pocket, and tossed around the prism, but even if it was scraped and cut, In the end, it is still in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland felt a bit wrong, he gestured to the night, "Let's try."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
