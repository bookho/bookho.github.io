			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All Charges!" Almost at the same time, Lehman's voice shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowly looked at Lehman Hoss, who had fallen from the horse immediately, and the back half of his head was completely blasted, revealing red and white smudges. The broken helmet fell to one side, and the top of the hole with a large opening seemed to have no protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Chong, give it to me!" Then Levin’s voice rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I didn’t speak at all! Levin licked his mouth and looked behind him. The militiamen couldn’t wait to swallow the pill and start running, as if a wall of people was coming to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a witch, he realized that the witch mimicked his voice. "Don't rush, stop!" he shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this voice is like a tiny splash in the raging crowd, and some people hear his orders stop, but more people continue to charge forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick, fast, break the enemy's defense line in the middle, the town let you plunder!" Not just his voice, Dorn and other knights' voices It sounded in unison, and the sound overshadowed all the embarrassment, as if it were directly in the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a burst of voices in the ranks, as if in cooperating with this order, everyone shouted the slogan of "plundering" and did not know who opened it. Head, but soon resounded the whole team. The situation has completely lost control, and how Le Wen shouted, but also all drowned in the excitement of everyone. He must control the horses with all his strength to prevent himself from being taken away by the torrents. The militiamen, like the loss of reason, rushed toward the center of the boulevard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, they have no reason at all, especially in the case of someone guiding, after taking the medicine, they will enter a state of extreme excitement, and any killing will stimulate They go further. At the beginning, there were people who avoided Lehman who fell to the ground. Later, everyone had stepped on him directly from his body. Levin wants to find Dorn and others, but now they have been rushed away. Under the circumstance, he had to follow the direction of the team and gradually lean toward the side of the woods. If you suddenly hit the horse, it is likely The militia, who was lifted several times by force, knocked down. At that time, it would be difficult to get up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After escaping from the team, Levin looked around and wanted to find the messy witch to find the corpse. In his opinion, this is definitely a witch's plot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1,500 people who took the pill rushed toward the town defense line, which was also a deadly assault on the prince, even if the other party’s new weapon There are so many people who can't stand so many people, and the end result is definitely not good. In the case of both sides suffering losses, it is obviously the situation that the witches have come to see, so they will make a fuss from them and induce the army to advance without authorization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The witch who kills Lehman and creates chaos should not be the same person," he looked to the few militiamen around him - they are all standing in the team. In front, I witnessed the fall of Lehman and the people who heard the call to stop the order, but compared with the huge army, there were fewer than thirty people coming together. "One person’s ability should be hidden, one person. It's a simulated sound. A witch can't have two abilities to find out the latter. I have to tear her throat by myself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian can see from the shooting window that the enemy is getting closer and closer, and the bunker in front of it has already sounded a gunshot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of his garrison is in the middle of the diamond, and he must wait for the enemy to pass the purple marker next to the road to fire. This wait makes him anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the other side of the window, Brian looked to the rear, and the white smoke was constantly spurred on the artillery's position, and a loud noise rolled like a thunder. They are the first to get busy. The 12-pound gun has a range that covers almost the entire battlefield. If you listen carefully, you can even hear the sound of the shelling through the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, they run really fast!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the guy, being shot The hand was cut and still running forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Highness is right, is this still a human? It is just like a beast."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
