			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is... your ability?" Wendy reacted after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She can’t hear," Annie said. "After becoming a weapon, the broken sword will lose the ability to communicate with the outside world. Only when you hold her. She can perceive the world through your five senses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it like this? Wendy hesitated, reaching forward and holding the hilt gently - in an instant, her mind seemed to have more consciousness, and the blade merged with her at this moment, as if it had become part of the body. Not only that, but Wendy also felt that her vision and hearing were sharper, and she was full of strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Community." The sound of a broken sword sounded in my mind. "When you pick me up, everything I have will be attached to you." When it comes to this, her voice seems to show a trace of regret. "Unfortunately, I am not very good at a small body, and my strength is limited, even if If you stack it together, it won't help much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why I feel the power is full is because I have inherited the ability to break the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty raised his weapon and looked at it carefully - the hilt was warm and soft, like a living thing. The shape of the blade is somewhat weird. The length is only about one arm. It is as thin as a finger, and the front is flat and round. It is more like a sword than a sword. If you look closely, you can also see the finely arranged stripes on the sword, as if it were bundled with countless silver filaments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter can't help but think of the striking silver hair of the broken sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long can you maintain this form?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't change it, you can continue Go on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems like Mai Mai, she thinks that only the moment of change will consume a lot of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mc茜? Are you talking about the huge pigeon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty Only then did it react, and as long as it was attached to the broken sword, the other party could see the thoughts she had in her mind. This made her slightly flustered. After all, there are some things she doesn't want anyone to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your mood is a little floating... What is this, tape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing "Wenty quickly inserted the blade back into the ground and looked at Annie. "Cough, can anyone be connected with the broken sword?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In theory, as long as she is willing to accept, ordinary people can also get her strength," Annie nodded. "But in that state, she is just a particularly hard weapon. Only in the hands of the witch, she can play. Real strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witches...in the hands?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Anne What seems to be seen, calmly said, "The other minds are not equal to the sneak conscious, as long as you don't focus on the current idea, the broken sword is not aware of your mood."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand," Wendy calmed down and regained the hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just said something wrong, hold apologize, I won’t ask any more questions," the eager voice of the broken sword immediately appeared. In her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, nothing..." She suddenly thought of a question, "What if you suddenly let go of you, what do you see?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will become dark, neither sound nor touch, as if it is floating in nothingness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Sure enough, this moment of losing all senses of experience will certainly not be too good. Think of it here, Wendy said as soon as possible, "I apologize that I am relieved... I will not lose it anymore. I am next to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
