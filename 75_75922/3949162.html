			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second law of thermodynamics: it is impossible to transfer heat from a low temperature object to a high temperature object without any other influence, or it is impossible to take heat from a single heat source to make it completely Converting to useful work without other effects, or the micro-increment of entropy during irreversible thermal forces is always greater than zero."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland will trim the law Copy it on paper - use the text of this world. At first glance, I feel a bit like Yu Wen. He really can't understand how local people learn such cumbersome words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one of the many laws of physics is most boring, Roland will definitely choose the second law of thermodynamics. It tells everyone that the world's heat will always go from high to low, disorder is in order, and entropy is increasing. In the end everyone will return to nothingness, the universe will become dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the world is free from the entropy increase, the magic can be born out of nothing, which is even greater than the invention of perpetual motion! The power of the devil? Roland sneered at this, they did not realize the essence of this power, and said that it can even change the entire universe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, now, you can start by changing the town of Bianbu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland squatted in a minor tone, tore the note and still into the fireplace, seeing it turned into ashes in the fire, and there was a thrill of destroying the cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant minister looked at the inexplicable movement of the four princes, so that the other party has always been like this, doing things without any adjustment, and he can see the prince’s mood Not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It has been completed, "Witches" were hanged at noon," Barov reports.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, should no one see anything? Roland tapped his pen. "There are wigs all the time." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order not to let the Holy See and the Witch help the club to find the door, Roland Warden found a similarly executed prisoner from the dungeon instead of Anna, and in addition to the chief All the people outside the Cavaliers and Assistant Ministers have awarded 20 Golden Dragons as a sealing fee. This is a very rich income for them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balov I also suggested that you should let the witnesses shut up forever and be rejected by Roland. He knows that these secrets will not last for too long, but it doesn't matter. He hopes that someone can spread the news - as long as it is not now. It’s a matter of time to turn your face. No one can tolerate those idiots that are so ruined! When other witches know that there is a small town on the border of the kingdom that allows them to live freely and even give them generous treatment, what do the witches think?<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which era, talent is the most important.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So just like this," Roland said. , "Next, Bentham Town last year Easy, tax and remit the necessary expenses you always give me a look, as well as the city of those workshops, ironware, textiles, pottery such, but also lower the number and size statistics. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It takes three days for these records to be sorted out, but..." Barov nodded first, then looked like a word. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What else? "Roland knows that the time to test the ability of the mouth is over. Everything that has been done yesterday will always have doubts. If you are guilty, the bad character is not equal to the brain. There is such a thing as stealing a witch. In the eyes of the assistant minister, it is simply The world is an enemy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, I don’t understand..." Barov deliberately used the words. "In the past, although you were noisy, they were all innocuous. But... Why do you risk a witch to save such a big risk? Although hunting them is the law set by the church, your father, His Majesty, is also very much recognized. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought for a moment and asked, "Do you think Bentham Town is a good place?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this..." Although I don’t quite understand how this sentence relates to my own problem, Barov still replied truthfully, "not counting it is good. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is very bad. Compared with Jinsuicheng and Clearwater Harbor, how much do you think I am better than those brothers and sisters? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The assistant minister opened his mouth and did not answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
