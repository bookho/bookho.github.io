			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hurts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbearable pain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It smacks the tentacles, squirming the surrounding seawater, and the "blade" and "foot" hidden in the body are shivering, apparently revealed by it. The anger that came out was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain is not a strange feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of the birth to the eyes of the nest, it fights, injures, annexes, and evolves more than once, and the pain can make the body's reaction more acute. The feedback necessary to absorb the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a pain that makes it angry, but... an unprecedented emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It tries to match this emotion with other life's reactions, but soon finds that it is not necessary - the feeling is in the instinct of most species Even if the individuals are far apart, they are surprisingly the same at this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It found that it was the first time that it tasted fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes it a little overwhelmed and subconsciously angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kill her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; want to kill her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worm that rushed into his body, the worm that dared to challenge himself with the insignificant magic! Sooner or later, she will tear her into pieces and hang her head on the skeleton, just like the red fog reptile did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, whether it is anger or fear, it is not the emotion necessary for growth - it has never been feared for the pain, nor will it be for a moment Frustrated and annoyed, even... it has never thought about such a problem before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides evolution, nothing else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evolution is more important than survival, survival is only for the individual, and evolution is the sublimation of the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It realized that something had happened to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is it wrong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about this problem, it makes its head painful - the hot flame not only makes it lose one-third of its body, but also Make its reaction dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time can make its body weight as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time can also let it find the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It suppresses the fear, anger, and other subtleties in the bottom of the heart, but it is the first time to experience the mixed emotions, sinking into the mud on the bottom of the sea. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than ten days, it climbed out of the hiding place and put the body in the blade And "foot" were all released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the loss in the battle, it does not care. As long as the injury is fully restored, new vassals can be born at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hungry and needs to be eaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, some of his own problems have also come to a conclusion. First, it found that it lost a lot of pheromones, which were taken from all kinds of bugs and could help the evolution of the community and collect them. It is also the primary task of the eye of the nest. This loss can be understood - with the loud noise, its body is smashed by flames and heat waves, some of which are used to store the brain of pheromones. Now even if it is repaired seven or seven, but it is gone, it is like a water bottle that has been poked. Afterwards, it will not help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, the most important red fog is not lost, and the loss is limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that it has lost contact with the mother of the main nest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is incredible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since its birth, its destiny has been closely linked to the ethnic group. This relationship is inseparable, as long as it is in the same water, no matter how far apart, It can feel the existence of the main nest. Through water waves, it can pass the collected pheromones as well as share the evolutionary instructions of the community. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now - no more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hardly thought about this after the injury, and waited until the consciousness flowed smoothly, ready to spread the pheromone of the polychaete, only to feel the sense of the previous Where did it come from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when the ocean is in the tide, when the waters are in one, it can't hear the call of the main nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first it suspected that the body was not completely reborn, but as long as it was not completely dead, any individual separated from the main nest would not sever its connection. After repeated examinations, it found that some of its brains were actually integrated with the red misty polyphages, rather than completely annexed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously the other side made a final dying struggle as it faltered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After realizing this, it was first shocked and angry, but it quickly calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low-energy bugs are bugs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even this did not attract a little benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has not fully felt the presence of polychaetes. On the contrary, the eyes left by the red mist bugs are all owned by it, through these strange magic eyes, it Can "see" a lot of primitive life looking to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a long time, it finally came to a conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this part of the fusion that makes it impossible to contact the main nest, and it also contaminates some strange "bug emotions." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such as anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And...self. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the above results, it should have returned to the zenith sea, telling the mother of the main nest what happened, and then giving it to the other party - In the case where water wave transmission does not work, the annexation can completely retain the lower pheromone, thereby helping the population to obtain available evolutionary instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evolution is more important than survival, which is a matter of course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it hesitates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these ten days, it has found that he has thought more than he has in the past 100 years, whether it is fighting, annexing, collecting, or growing. It's like instinct, but now, this instinct seems to be gone...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that there is no limit to the use of pheromones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evolution is a very cautious choice. After all the pheromones collected by the nest are passed to the main nest, the main nest analyzes and filters useful fragments. After the construction, the evolutionary instructions are released. Evolution is not only a change in the eye of the nest, but also as a vassal of the main nest, as small as the "blade" and "foot". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is almost no difference in the eyes of each nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when it waited for the body to recover, it unexpectedly used a pheromone - from a primitive individual who could heal itself quickly. It is for this reason that the serious injury that took at least a few months to repair has been improved in just ten days, and it has also perceived its differences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no longer a normal nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
