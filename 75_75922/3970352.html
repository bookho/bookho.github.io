			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only heard a sigh of thunder after the fire flashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder came from far away, the tone was not high, but it was still honest. Accompanied by the sound is a soil column, located just next to the wooden house that detonated the snow powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened just now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Snow powder was detonated?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not like it seems to be the ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just kidding, this distance There is almost one more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers talked a lot, and Weimas frowned. Could it be that the other side was aware of the underground? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information gathered from various sources shows that the rebels have extremely powerful snowball weapons, both of which have a range and accuracy that exceeds that of the Wangdu blacksmiths. Those iron pipes that come out. Therefore, from the beginning, His Majesty decided not to confront him, but to use the strategy of ambushing the snow powder to make those weapons nowhere available. In addition, the things that flared out of the bow should be the enlarged version of the firearms. They can hold more snow powder, and the shots fired out are also more powerful. It is harder to manufacture than the hand-held firearms. The blacksmith was busy for a winter, and the gadgets were not as good as the stone blasters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for the fire to reappear, and it was also a low bang. This time the pillars swelled against the wooden house, and the splashed soil fell to the roof of the shed. on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guess is fulfilled, and the other party is obviously coming to the room - they have found the snow powder buried near the pier! In this way, the ambush plan of Tiefko was ineffective, and Weimas thought, maybe they really had a chance to touch the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a snowball weapon that is more fierce, or the wall of the kingdom is stronger, and there will be a difference after this battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, a loud bang from the city--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is so Hong Liang, as if the thunder jumped directly in the ear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground in front of the pier suddenly arched a hill, countless mud and stones were thrown high, smoke and white mist erupted from the mud Formed a cloud-like air mass. The violent shock swept the earth, and the top of the wall swayed in an instant. Weimas subconsciously squatted down, and Skar slammed his feet and fell on his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky that flew into the air fell like a rainstorm, but it couldn’t hear any sound on the ground. Weimas’s ear creaked and passed. After a while, I recovered from this sudden tremor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, the idiot didn’t even wait until the flag to detonate all the snow powder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original flat land is like being bitten by something at the moment, there are pits everywhere, and the heat and white smoke are still emerging from the loose black mud. The air is filled with the smell of smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weimas found half of the head from behind the wall, and saw that the fleet in the distance moved again and lined up in a row. The militia, originally used as a bait, either stumbled on the dock or had already left its weapons and began to flee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is responsible for the ignition?" Skar angered and picked up the guards around him. "I want to screw his head down!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the man of the Highness," the Steel Knight knight yelled. "Give me the mark, they will go ashore soon, ready to raise the blue flag."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who wants to hide in the warehouse can complete the task, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results did not see any movement until the other party's personnel boarded the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When the earth-shattering roar sounded, Allen Abel was taking care of his sword, and the huge explosion and tremors shocked him almost without losing his hand and throwing his hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still outside the two or three, if it is in a trap, what kind of scene will it be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He comforted the restless mount, took the sword into the sheath, and made a gesture toward the cavalry team behind him. "When the door is open, you will follow me." Charge, don't keep horsepower, they are behind the canal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has not recovered from the thunder and shock, and the response sounds astonished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen shouted loudly. "This is the trap set by His Majesty. The Thunder's Wrath punishes the opponent, not us! Get up the spirit, they have no matter what Can be retired!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes..." This answer has finally sang together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of mercenaries behind him is still a look of disappointment, Allen shook his head disdainfully, he did not take these people seriously, but Followed by the end of the mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after a while, the gates still did not open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is going on? He looked at the top of the city wall with some doubts, but the Steel Knight did not give any new instructions - the charge could start at any time, he could not leave the garrison position and went up to ask the situation. Time passed by, and suddenly, he heard another muffled sound, and the sound seemed to come from far away. If you remember correctly, it seems to be an attack launched by the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s wrong with the plan? Does the snow powder trap not let the other side collapse and flee? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咻——<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly anxious, a strange wind rang, Ai Lun had not had time to think about it, the blue brick next to the gate suddenly burst open! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Korean! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scattered gravel was splashed all the time, he felt a numb at the waist, stiff and fell, and the frightened horse stepped in the run His thighs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong pain caused him to scream: "Oh, my legs ---!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two 扈 from immediately Surrounded by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Control the team, don't let them mess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen resists stinging Shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The array of cavalry is in chaos, no one knows what happened, they are escaping, and it’s hard to suppress from the screaming This sudden change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to get up, but tried it a few times and didn’t succeed. The probe looked and saw his thigh twisted into a strange shape. The flesh was blurred, the deformed guard deck was smashed to one side, and the white broken bone tore the flesh and pants, revealing a small half, and there was still a piece of minced meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan’s heart was cold and his knight’s career was over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the weird wind rang again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sudden change is the city gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw with his own eyes that the two guards behind the gates were surrounded by a mass of debris, and the scattered wood and flying stone chips swept over. The dust dissipated, and Allen suddenly found that the upper body of the two was cut off by the sharp edge, and the blood mixed with the red and green internal organs. They also had five or six cavalry behind them. The pieces of wood that were usually harmless at the moment became a weapon of life, like a knife, and the thumb-sized stone could penetrate the armor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a washbasin-sized gap on the nearly two-foot-thick city gate, and the enemy is still far away from Sanli at the moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
