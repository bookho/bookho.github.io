"Her progress is quite big."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed," Roland nodded. "Lucia White is from the merchant house of Jinsuicheng. It has a certain foundation in writing and arithmetic, plus the theory of nature. "There is such a good result when the class is accepted well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no doubt that you said "enhanced understanding and understanding of the world can promote the evolution of ability" "Tilly grinned. "But what does this have to do with magic? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the observation of Lily, the leaves, mystery, etc., the ability to evolve will also have the effect of increasing the body's upper limit of magic. I think this effect and the world." The degree of cognition also has a great relationship," Roland combined with Agatha's "the ancient high-level awakening" and the town witch "the evolution of power", explained his conjecture in detail, "they are essentially One thing, but the one-sided or isolated epiphany effect, its magical improvement is far less than the comprehensive, overall world cognition - the mystery month is an excellent example, although she is a member of the witch alliance, but through the epiphany Evolution, its magic level is far less than that of Anna and Soroya."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tillia thought for a while, and soon understood the meaning of Roland, "You mean Miss Lucia is because she has been at a low level of magic before, whether it is usual or awakening day, the body is adapted to this magical strength. This time, when adulthood happens to trigger evolution at the same time, it leads to the magic of the body suddenly turning over. How many times, it is far beyond what the body can accept?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About this, but I tend to be different," Roland Fingers said, "For the magic, several key lifting points are awakening day, adult day and evolution, it seems that the effect seems the same, but I think the first two are forced to grow, while the latter is actively promoted. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you say this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the evolution of power, there is no magical anti-phagocytic symptoms "The prince slowly said, "If there is no difference between the two, the magical power of Anna’s rapid growth will only kill her. I assume that the witch body has a warning line for the magic capacity. Beyond this limit, the body will feel it. The pain of reflexion. The daily training can gradually increase the upper limit. The purpose of emptying the magic before awakening is also here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warning line? Interesting saying ......" Tilly thoughtfully, "You think Miss Lucia grew up when it evolved. Excessive magic, resulting in a reserved space for the awakening day to force into the body is not enough, and finally exceeded the limit, causing this accident?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrong, although Anna and Lucia are also the first to evolve in adulthood, her previous magic stock is very amazing, and the warning line for counter-attack is much higher than the average witch.” Rolandton, "In addition, this also explains why Speer has regained his arrogant magic, and Lucia has returned to normal - those magics do not belong to her. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This point of view...can explain a lot of questions," she said, licking her fever and holding her chin. "Why is the magic? In the witches, they show different forms; why the magic of the outside world can only be seen when the witches are awakened - because they will become part of themselves only after being accepted by the witch. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland laughs, "Awakening can be seen as attracting magic, but in the end it can only leave a small part, and evolution is the one that will be its own." A small part is enlarged and enhanced, and the more comprehensive the cognition, the better the reinforcement effect. As for the fact that there is no limit to the number of evolutions, it is reasonable. How can the world be explored? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was suddenly curious. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are a witch, how will the magic of evolution be achieved?" Tilly covered her mouth and laughed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland almost sipped his mouth, although he wanted to experience the wonders of extraordinary ability personally, but to pay so much The price is still grateful and insensitive.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The textbooks you wrote, can I bring a copy back to the island? She raised a brow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
