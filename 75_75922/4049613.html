			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, I have never revealed to you and Thunder adults to others..." She hurriedly argued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Roland waved his hand and looked at Moore with great interest. "Where did you hear the news?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he didn’t treat the matter as confidential, the steel ship has just built a bottom shell, and it’s been at least a few months before the launch, and the whole process They are all built in the shoal's fully enclosed dock, and the selected workers are all the most skilled local residents. It is almost impossible for outsiders to know the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is anyone in the locals who is secretly contacting the fjord, it is worth noting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thunder Master is recruiting new expeditions, which is more than ever before. This is a big event in the fjord. Chord Moon Bay also happens to have Many outstanding captains are not unusual to enter his team.” Jia Momo laughed. “The news about this magical iron ship was also from the Thunder. After all, it’s going to dispel others’s into the west of the Shadow Islands. In the sea's concerns, he must show some hard means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many people know about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not much, your Majesty, the prestige of Thunder adults is much higher than those of us. If the captain was not greatly blessed by the Chamber of Commerce, he would not reveal a half sentence to us. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that," Roland nodded. "But the ship is extremely difficult to manufacture, and it will not be able to build a second ship for a while. So you I can't meet the requirements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can understand, respect Your Majesty," Marlan said. "We only hope that after you complete the transaction with the Thunder, you will sell the second steel ship to us. For this reason, the Crescent Bay Chamber of Commerce is willing to pay a 10% deposit first, etc. The work immediately filled the remaining 40%."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without asking the price, I started talking about the deposit, and Roland once again realized the adventure of the fjord. Spirit, or sensitivity to the ship, they are much higher than the rulers of the four kingdoms. At least he has never seen a big aristocrat who spends a lot of money on something he has never seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No winter city needs steel ships, and more than one ship. When the dock can be empty, it may have to be two or three years later." He replied unhurriedly. "You have not considered sending craftsmen to participate in the construction, signing a new ten-year or five-year agreement? That may speed up a lot of construction progress, and you can get corresponding afterwards. "Technology."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are joking," added Moore. "We definitely don't mean it, if the steel boat can really be like the Thunder." That way, you can use it to become the most popular partner of the fjord islands, how can we dare to speak to you like this technology."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not in Just kidding.” Roland drank a drink and shrugged easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." This time it was the turn of the two to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Gamore asked incredulously, "What do you mean... would you like to disclose the technology to the Crescent Bay Chamber of Commerce?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you can provide enough craftsmen, not only blacksmiths and carpenters, apprentices can do it," Roland said without hesitation. "Two thousand people - not enough Just use literate civilians to make up, how to pay in five years, how? So your ship will start working next year. Of course, the cost of shipbuilding will still be paid by you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I really can't guess what you think, sire," added Moore, and said, "Isn't this the technology at the bottom of your box?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Roland shook his head. "The steel ship I built for the Thunder is the latest sharp technology that no winter city can get."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This It is not that he is deliberately flickering. "So far" is absolutely no exaggeration... As for after five or six years, who knows? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why are you..." Garmore groaned and then waved helplessly. "No, I still don't ask. String Moon Bay is willing to reach this." Pen transaction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
