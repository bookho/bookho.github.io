			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later, Roland received two good news. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is that the iron axe uses a napalm bomb, giving the devil a headache with a very limited force, and delaying the advancing speed of the enemy in the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general commander described in detail the new weapons in the explosion, which can be said to be even more amazing than the results obtained from the test. In fact, using the flame to curb the devil appeared as early as the first battle of the gods. At that time, humans repeatedly circulated around the enemy to ignite the forest, causing a mountain fire that would not be extinguished for several days, making the front line red fog. Unable to gather, and finally achieved a good record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, the devil who learns the lesson will destroy the woods, grasslands, and even the farmland in a targeted manner, so as to avoid interruption of supply. At the same time, even if they are in the red fog-covered area, a small stone tower camp similar to the outpost will be established, just in case. As long as red fog is stored in the camp, even if the fire is behind, they can persist until the fire is extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the Iron Axe and the General Staff were inspired by the above-mentioned war cases to plan the burning of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of a napalm is that it comes with its own fuel, even if it is an open space, it can cause a raging fire, and it is extremely difficult to be extinguished by water. It’s just that no one thought that the flame didn’t burn for a long time, but it caused a deflagration that covered the whole city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can let Axia go to the scene, Roland has no regrets, if you can find out why, you can target it in the future. The use of burning petrol bombs caused a devastating blow to the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, according to the time projection, the city of fangs should have been swallowed up by the red fog, and it is unlikely that it will be sneaked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the use of more than 500 barrels of napalm in a single use also made Roland feel bad. After all, the oil is still good to say, as long as more people can increase production, the key is to let the rubber insect mucus have affinity animal blood, in addition to relying on the Ministry of Agriculture to slowly accumulate no other way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the immigrants who returned from the victory are more important than anything else. Roland not only encouraged the iron axe in the reply, but also produced more than one hundred barrels of new ones. Napalm is also approved for the front line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second good news is that the assembly plant of "Tianhuo" finally ushered in the successful launch of the first two-wing aircraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got the news from Anna and arrived at the factory with Tilly the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new factory and the Air Knight Academy were built in the same period, compared to the steam engine factory built two or three years ago, it was designed from the beginning Taking into account the various needs of high-end manufacturing, the steel structure frame makes it have a very open space inside, can be equipped and repaired for more than ten aircraft at the same time, and the lighting fixtures are full of the entire ceiling. With a bright and sleek terrazzo floor, you can use the grandeur to describe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when Tilly approached the factory gate, she couldn’t help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you change to an uninformed person, it is not surprising to treat this as a palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the personnel and equipment, Roland also made a lot of money, from the various workshops to the most experienced managers and workers, the processing equipment is all used The third generation of electric-powered machine tools to meet cutting-edge production needs. This makes it the leading power consumer in the industrial zone. If there is no mystery instrument, if you want it to run at full capacity, you can only suspend the power supply of other factories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that the achievements and accumulation of the winter city in the past five years are fully reflected in this new factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland even heard from Barov that no winter people are proud to be able to work here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the plan, when the new plant is officially put into operation, each of its workstations will undertake a special assembly task. From the first station to the last one is the whole process of the aircraft gradually forming - the body starts riveting from the root skeleton, pressing the wings, loading the parts, and attaching the skin to the factory test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
