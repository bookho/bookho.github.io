			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, Your Majesty... Mr. Bird. Come back from the whirlpool And...they seem to have had a big problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pro-sense report gave Roland a slight meal. After the meeting to expand the industrial scale, he returned to the office, intending to continue to improve the drawings to be used next, and this unexpected news completely disconnected his ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called Sander. Bird is the pseudonym of Thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is he now?" Roland stood up and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the castle hall, he said he hopes to see you immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Bring him in!" he ordered. "Let the kitchen prepare an afternoon tea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I will do it." Sean Turned around and quickly disappeared into the doorway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale is a little worried, "Would I like to inform the lightning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shook his head, "Since he can come to the castle, he should have not encountered any serious problems, or ask the situation first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the date, the Thunder went out to sea for more than half a year. It is only three months away from the sea, considering that they have been in the shadows for a while, and the flowers on the road are even shorter. This is far below the original plan of the explorer. According to the other's vision, the voyage will take at least one year to a year and a half. If you can, the Thunder even wants to see what is at the end of the vortex sea. Whether the continent you see is in the depths of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obvious that what happened to the manpower that couldn’t be countered was the end of the long-awaited adventure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but look out the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't be... Also related to the Red Moon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Thunder, which was named Sander, quickly entered the office under the leadership of the guards. It can be seen that he came back really embarrassed, even disguised. The beard didn't have time to affix it, and the flamboyant feather decoration was almost left. If it is now seen by lightning, it will be recognized in all likelihood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at least, he is still intact, and for Roland, this is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, I’m very happy to see you again--" Thunder sighed and said, "I almost thought I couldn’t come back again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland personally poured a cup of cold and delicious chaotic drink. "What happened? Since it is the most outstanding voyage of the fjord islands, I I don’t think that ordinary storms or tsunami will let you say this.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The storm and the tsunami have signs, but thousands of sea ghosts do not There will be," Thunder seems to have a lingering moment at the moment, "not to mention that we are not only encountering sea ghosts, but also more terrible monsters than that..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen In the other party's remarks, Roland seemed to feel their desperation at that time. Countless sea ghosts flocked to the fleet. The tumbling back seemed to make the sea boiling, and the slow sailing boat was ruthlessly dragged into hell. The sea ghosts are also mixed with horrible flesh and blood vessels. The acid they spray can fall a few kilometers away. As long as they stick a little bit, they will be smeared, and steel and wood can't resist this kind of corrosion. Even if the sails are full, the expedition can't open the distance between the two sides...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tianhaijie..." He sinks into the waterway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, what is that?" asked the Thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The devil's name for another civilization," Roland slowly told the other side about the devil's intelligence on the two-line battle. The rib-like vault, flesh and organ hull can float like water on the surface of the sea and sneak into the sea. These features are similar to what he saw in the relics of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe. Of course, it does not rule out that the Red Moon will make them more active, thus expanding the scope of the inspection." Roland changed the subject, "After that? How is the expedition fleet out of danger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, it’s not that we have lost their pursuit, but that they have had civil strife themselves." Thunder smiled bitterly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inside...chaos?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true that the enemy’s chase does not stay up all night, It seems that we never know how tired we are. When we get close to the sea line, we have lost more than half of the ships. Most of the sailors who are still alive are close to collapse because they can't rest for a long time. Only the snow winds you make still have the strength. - After all, she doesn't need to adjust the sails and course at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the eve of desperation, a bigger monster suddenly rushed out The water surface, entangled in one of the sea monsters, is like two flesh-and-blood monsters biting each other. Although they are all monsters, the former is obviously stronger, and the auxiliary limbs and tentacles extending from the body quickly take the latter. After tearing up, the sea ghosts and other sea monsters stopped chasing them. Just as they were surrounded by the two, we took the opportunity to cross the sea and escape to the fjord." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still such a thing, Roland is long and vomiting," Good luck is on your side, it seems that the name of the ship is really white."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...船名?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, nothing," he waved his hand. "What are your plans for the next time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder’s face appears There is an unprecedented fatigue. "To be honest, the loss of the sea boat is still second. This adventure has already scared most people. Now the fjord is filled with a strange atmosphere, those who have worked hard for a lifetime." The sailor, now looking to the east of the sea, his face is blue. I don't think anyone will dare to board the ship to the shadows for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roland is silent. This is not unexpected. As the other party said, storms and tsunami can be predicted in advance. Brave sailors can always find a way to dance with them, but this kind of rebellious force can only escape the experience. It can't be called adventure at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The big chambers of commerce are asking me to bring you words, hoping to buy a piece of land in the Grey Fortress at a high price, as their refuge." "Thunder sighed. "After all, no one knows if they will make a comeback. The sea has always been a natural danger in the eyes of the fjords. But if the enemy can come and go freely in the sea, the entire fjord island is equivalent. The fortified empty city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan is not as fast as change. A year or two ago, he also planned to use the fjord as the last survivor for the rest of his life. According to the point of view, the situation is now reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he has just arrived in Bianbu Town, and all his homes are less than 300 Golden Dragons, this kind of transaction is absolutely impossible, but now, the banknotes have begun to be in the territory. In circulation, the so-called "high price" is no longer an attractive condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said if it is to establish a country in the middle of the country The idea is to give up as soon as possible.” Thunder shrugged. “You will never allow them to establish a new 'islande' in the Grey Fort.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland laughs It is worthy of being the most outstanding explorer in the fjord. "If you just want to live, not for the privilege accumulated for generations, the Grey Fort will always welcome them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I will tell you the truth, sire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This tour should be exhausted, I prepared afternoon tea, you can go to a bubble Take a hot bath and talk to me about the trip on the road. It will take a few days to repair the Snowwind, and it will not be too late to return to the fjord until you recover."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's bothering you." Thunder stroked the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was about to retire, Roland suddenly stopped him. "Right, lightning... Are you still going to hide it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." Thunder opened his mouth and was dumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
