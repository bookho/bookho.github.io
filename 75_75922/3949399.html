			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, Anna took a large bag of birds and kissed mushrooms into the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These white mushrooms are all harvested from the fascinating forests - unlike ordinary mushrooms, which are usually grown on top of huge trees. It is also a favorite food for some birds by relying on the nutrients of the trees. Although its taste is extremely delicious, the thick handle of the handle is as delicate as tender meat. Due to the high growth position, it is difficult to detect under the standing position. There are not many people who are willing to climb up the tree to find the picking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her mother will always pick up some more on the day of her birthday, making two mushroom dishes to celebrate the birthday, compared to moldy The thick bread and the savory porridge, the unique taste made her hard to forget. Although I no longer have to worry about eating too much, and the daily food is a lot more abundant, she still wants to make these two delicious foods that can only be tasted in the western town. I will share it with the recent busy daily. The late Royal Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stove in the kitchen has been extinguished, but it’s hard to beat Anna, she throws the wood into the stove, calls out the black fire, and soon the flame in the hearth Exuberantly burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the nightingale suddenly came out of the wall. "Hey, what are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to eat something for my Highness, he just slept very late. What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, haha," she touched Touching the back of the head, "I just want to find some snacks to eat... The stomach is a little hungry," paused, her curious probe came over, "What are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well... honey baked mushrooms and mushroom soup" Anna opened the bag, revealing the bird inside the mushroom, "all are the unique food in Bianbu Town, do you want to try it?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night nodded, and soon followed. "Can you teach me to do it... I also want to learn to do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes," Anna laughed. "It's easy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After slicing the mushroom, she grabbed a lot of points for the nightingale, "put the mushroom first Apply a layer of butter evenly on both sides, then put it on the fire and bake it carefully. Until the two sides are golden. Be careful not to bake for too long, it will be black."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the nightingale took the bird to kiss the mushroom and learned the appearance of Anna. Both sides of the front and the back are greased. "His Royal Highness worked late?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, in order to house the refugees, and draw some drawings of new machinery, he Almost every day after midnight, I went to sleep. There were several times when I passed the office, I could see the light shining through the door." Anna nodded. "I have been away for almost half a month, you miss His Highness, right?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale shook slightly, the mushroom fell into the butter, "Oh... it’s okay..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not only you, lightning, Lily, Echo, Wendy, I miss my Highness, they say there is no place to take a bath, I always want to come back," Anna suddenly felt that the other person's look was a bit strange. "Oh, what's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," she licked her head and picked up the mushroom. Someone smiled embarrassedly. "It turns out that it is true... I miss you very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Anna applied directly with her hand. The mushroom of the oil, into the fire, "If I leave the temple for half a month, no, maybe only a few days, I can't wait to see him again." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting with Roland Wimbledon in the dungeon is the most incredible moment of her life. Until today, she still feels warm and happy. Grateful. If it is not His Royal Highness, even if she can continue to live, she will only live in obscurity and confusion, just like the numb townspeople.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes Her Royal Highness taught her the beauty of the world, whether it is pepper steak with sauce or "The Foundation of Natural Science Theory", his appearance filled a new thing for his life, so that she finally felt that she is no longer Like everyone else, it is a unique witch.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other sisters must also think so - as long as they have been with His Royal Highness, it is impossible not to fall into him. Among those whimsy and unique charm, Anna is convinced of this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
