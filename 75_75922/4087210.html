			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the low whistle, Roland steadily docked at the dock. Probably because the ship was named after the Grand Chief, when Luo Jia walked off the trestle, he found that people coming back and forth on the dock stopped at the same time and raised his right hand in the direction of the big ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first soldiers on board also responded to the same posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That should be a special etiquette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itâ€™s just different from the etiquette she has ever seen. There seems to be no one on either side of the situation. Whether it is gift or courtesy, both sides are equal... ...this made her somewhat difficult to understand. If the two sides have the same status, why is it necessary to salute? In her opinion, whether it is a good worship or a fist, there is always a party as a recipient, in order to express the meaning of admiration and obedience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she also noticed that even the children playing at the docks had the same posture and the chest was tall. In the process, no one's look is humble and unwilling, and everyone's eyes are full of joy and vitality. Through such a ceremony, they seem to have completed an inexplicable communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a military ceremony," Ashes took the initiative to say. "At first I didn't understand why they did this. I thought it was Roland Wimbledon. The people were so exposed, and later discovered that it was not what I thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia surprised and raised a brow. "Is nothing wrong with this ship called Roland?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, as long as there are ships carrying the First Army, they will raise their hands spontaneously, because this represents another batch. The family members of the expedition returned safely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But they don't look like...a family," the three princess hesitated. Shouldn't it be more exciting if the family is greeted? And the soldiers are basically all male, and there are very few women on the dock. Do each of them have a brother? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia shrugged, "All members of the First Army are from no winter city, which means that not only most of the residents in the family join the army, neighbors in the neighborhood There are also quite a few. This is totally different from the mercenaries who are living around and the militia who are forced to come. It is more like a work full of honor. They celebrate the return of other children's children, and others will celebrate their own. The loved ones arrived safely - this is probably what the "people's army" said. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the people...the army?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women are exposed The expression of thinking, followed the witch and his party into the winter city.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first city in the city called the Grey Fort is the first image that is given to her. In addition to the open pedestrians, whether it is a house or a street, it is arranged in a straight line, even the trees on both sides of the road. This compact arrangement makes her feel a little suppressed, even though it looks spectacular. But there is no such thing as Iron Sands.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what disappoints her is that there is no snow in the winter city, even the hard road under the feet is Dry, only on the branches and the roof, can see some residual white snow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hope of traveling to a pure white snow city is lost.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is no advantage at all here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia found that some of the houses next to the street were hung above Huge plaques with a variety of signs, such as the old Orion leather, the straw paper house, the northern slope gemstones, etc... Although many of the horizontal cards are still in a blank state, these alone have made her dazed.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is still a sign at each intersection, which not only indicates where the ramps are leading, but also marks the corresponding streets.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, what she is leaving now is the Glorious Avenue.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf Girl soon realized that This is very helpful for strangers who have set foot on the winter city for the first time. Through these signs, she can quickly remember the general appearance of the city, know where to buy and sell goods, and where to stay overnight, thus avoiding resorting to local snake heads. Or the trouble of the mouse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
