			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reaffirmation of Roland’s previous speculation that the stone of the penalty will not affect the magic, but interfere with the ability of the witch to operate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to the Chaos Beast, the Quest will not find any way to transform the Magic Stone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Ai Gesha shook her head. "It’s easy to talk. The Federation has also seen a witch who can turn the stone of the gods into ordinary stone, but it is simply to erase the magic structure of the stone itself, and want to turn it into a magic stone. - Even the simplest illuminating stone is not enough." She looked at Sylvie. "You can see the magical form and you should be able to observe the true appearance of the spar."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A group of weak...clouds," Hillvi hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is one of the ways in which magic is cohesive," Aegusa nodded. "The Quest has observed statistics on nearly 10,000 witches and magic stones. It is found that before the promotion, most of the magic is in the form of clouds, cyclones, flying sand, light balls and flames. It seems to be the same, but in fact the details change is near infinity, which is why we believe that there are no two similarities. According to the high-order awakening, the ability is further agglomerated, and the shape is farther apart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's dimmed," Tilly suddenly pointed The luminous stone in the hands of Roland said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I only injected a small amount of magic," Ai Gesha explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I have seen the ever-changing light stone in the remains of the fjord," she said. "If the remains of the sea are made by you, Explain that the light stone has been illuminated for at least four hundred years. Can this be done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bottom of the sea?" Ai Gesha said, "Is there a union? The members went to the whirlpool?" Then she shook her head and threw the question aside. "It is possible to make the magic stone always bright, but it requires the assistance of more than a dozen witches."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten more than one..." Anna Si said, "Is it magical transfer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, some witches can add others The magic power, or directly exchange the magic of the two together, so that the injector is equal to the power beyond the self, so that the magic stone continues to take effect." Ai Gesha makes the luminous stone return to the original brightness "But this is not effective for every type of magic stone. In general, only the magical shape of the magical magic stone is the simplest." This is used, for example, illuminating stones and echo stones, but unfortunately these are not helpful to the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it is very useful for the castle," Roland looked at a box. Luminous stone, excited to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the electrical age, this gadget was an excellent lighting tool, and he had long been tired of the faint fire of the candle. Winter is ok, working in the office in the summer is a kind of torture, and the dim light is also very harmful to the eyesight. Now with these magic stones, even in the evening, the castle can be bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Aegusa didn't take it for granted. "I feel that it can play a bigger role in the lab. After all, I want to continue production at night." If you have liquid oxygen, the open flame is too unsafe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃...It’s not enough to work eight hours during the day, but also intend to take the initiative to work overtime? Roland turned his head. "Cough, let's look at the magic stones in other boxes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a circle, except for various shapes and brightness There are different kinds of illuminating stones, and there is a box of semi-mixed stones. According to the ice witch, although these are invaluable to the outside world, they are among the lowest-order varieties in the magic stone, such as the warning stone that sends out signals, and the pathfinding stone used for positioning. "The test items in the holy city stone tower are obviously not It may be me alone, and at that time I was basically out of the Quest, so it is also something that is irrelevant for the delivery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These books "Roland" refers to the black book in several other boxes. "Is all the test records?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still a part of "Falfine "," Ai Gesha's cheek is a rare red. "I want to leave a new guidance for the new witch who pioneered the wasteland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this? Interesting? Roland glanced at her strangely and continued to rummage through the rest of the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
