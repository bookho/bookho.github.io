			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland curiously looked at the moving Tahla high-level witches, who had a clear division of the tentacles, a short twist like a snake, providing support and The force of walking; the long is continuously inserted into the soil at the top of the head or under the foot, used to correct the direction - some tentacles are obviously amazing in length, from the height of the dome of the hall, I am afraid more than a hundred meters, and can shrink freely, like The arm is average. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to support such a long tentacles, I am afraid that no more powerful muscles can do anything. He guesses that the magic contained in the sarcoma gives them the power to act freely. Like the giant evil beasts whose physique clearly exceeds the gravity limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the two magic cores, and took dozens of steps, Pasha stopped in front of a cube like a gemstone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the stone of God's punishment, I can't get too close..." The nightingale reminded me in the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded quietly and asked Pasha, "Is the relics in it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this is the only way to limit the scope of its appeal. If there are no stones in the surrounding area, I am afraid that the residents of your city will be inadvertently affected by the relics." The tentacles, placed on the stone box, did not open it immediately. "Before touching it, I must explain something to avoid accidents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This thing... is it dangerous?” Wendy stepped forward and subconsciously blocked it in front of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry too much, as long as you don't live alone with the relics," Selin interjected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" Roland picked a brow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As I said before - when you open your life in front of the relics, you can see some incredible sights, whether they are witches or mortals. You can feel this call." Pasha's tone became a lot more serious. "But please remember that the scene you see is not completely fictional. Unlike the illusion instrument, the things in the picture can produce reality. Impact, this is the first point I want to say. Don't accept the inspiration of the gods at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene in the painting can affect the reality? Roland suddenly felt a little creepy. Isn't that the same as the scorpion crawling out of the TV? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are there more people than there are dangers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you are trapped in the gods In the situation, the body will have obvious reactions, such as sluggishness, dullness, slang, etc... This time you need people around you to drag you away from the influence of the relics." Pasha explained, "There has been a history book. Many of the records that come into contact with the relics alone, and finally the soul can not return to the body, and the two people, three people in turn can effectively reduce this risk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So," Roland looked at the Taqila witch. "In other words, there are at least five people here, so there is almost no danger, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If this is not the case, we will not let you observe it at a close distance." Celine nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for the second point, let me explain it." Ayr’s cold and cold voice sounded, "You should know, the huge scroll in the relics." What is shown is an alien civilization. If you have the chance to see them, they are possible... No, you will definitely try to hurt you. We can help you to forcibly leave the call, but it can't help you resist fear." She paused. There was a bit of sarcasm in the tone. "When I get scared, I don't say I didn't remind you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it?" Roland is not doing it. The movement, "Is there anything else to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Ayr probably didn't expect him to be so careless, couldn't help but glimpse . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't have it, open it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sighed in his heart, For the modern people who watch all kinds of monsters, aliens, horror, and horror movies, they are in a world of difference with the ancients. If you say that you are unprepared, you may be scared, but Elsie’s words are equivalent to high-energy warnings in a sense. As long as they don’t cause real harm, he doesn’t think he’s going to be like this. Intimidate and give up exploring the mysteries of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
