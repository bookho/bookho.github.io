			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the city, the flow of people has suddenly increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are still people who will look at them more, but they only stay in curiosity, everyone is in a hurry, and no one on the street can see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, here..." Luohan looked around with amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." He nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This busy scene, the first time Gulz was impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has traveled to many cities in the North, and those cities have left him with the most profound impression of prosperity - this is also the characteristics of the North: far more than the extreme Excellent land and resources have created an extraordinary city, the only difference is that a mountain is higher than a mountain. He thought that the king of the great chieftain would reach a new height in this respect. I didn't expect to attract his attention first, not the flat black stone long street under his feet, nor the one house with uniformity, but the people here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the inner city is wide and the castle is magnificent, the street corners are always indispensable to the wandering wanderers, beggars and mice. The embellishment is general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But walking in the winter city, not only can not see those embellishments, the look of people’s faces is completely different, the spirit of this look, even in the new It is rare in the Jinda clan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulz has always believed that the sand people are not much worse than the Northers, and even more aggressive because of environmental persecution. Although the Northland is rich in resources, the life that is too comfortable can make them indulge in enjoyment, but the courage and will will be inferior. If it is not the power of the clan, it is difficult to concentrate, they could have a broader place to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he is not so determined now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pride and self-confidence that comes from the heart is not disguised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A city made up of such a city, even if there is no firearm, it is best not to be an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Father, are we looking for Luo Jia first, or are we submitting documents to the castle first?" Luo Han’s feelings were not so deep, obviously his curiosity More than a surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is urgent, if you are placed in the castle area by the Grand Chief, how can you check his promise?" Gulze blinked. "Of course it is In the last few days, I would like to know more about the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have already decided." He interrupted. "Well? What are those people doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the side of the square full of people, snoring One after another, it looks very lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luohan looked down at his sight. "Probably buying discounted goods from dealers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You go and see." Gulze commanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter pulls on the hood, with the advantage of height and length, Soon squeezed into the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the eldest son’s nearly six-foot back, Gould couldn’t help feeling a bit. In terms of physique, he should have been the most brave warrior in the family, but I did not expect that nature does not love fighting, and finally, the propaganda of the mad flame clan is the Luojia who was born with a strong relationship. It is for this reason that the three princesses became the successors in the eyes of the tribes, and Luo Khan has been pressured to lift his head. It is obviously a brother and sister, but there are very few conversations, only to say that the heart is getting people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch has always had some disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially when Luo Jia was sought after by everyone, Luo Han did not even mean a little resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mo Jin people prefer the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, even after Luo Jia left, he has not made up his mind to let the eldest son take over as the patriarch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Rohan has a good performance in other respects, a leader who is afraid of competition can easily lose his original innocence. The advantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Gould took the eldest son on this trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hopes to make the other party change by increasing the way he sees it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, Luo Han quickly squeezed out the crowd, and at the same time looked quite weird. "Father, they are all people who sign up for the Games." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Games?" Gould swears, "What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" A big test conducted by the Grand Chief, I heard that it was to choose the fastest person in the world.” Luo Khan explained, “And the first place to get a reward of 100 Golden Dragons will lead to so many registrations. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hah, isn’t this the same as the holy duel? Except for the blood." Gulz smiled. "It seems that the great chief also The Shamin has learned a lot. What is the registration condition? Since it is the fastest in the world, we should be able to participate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We? "Luohan stunned. "Father, do you want to participate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I used to walk through half a desert on foot, leaving the camels behind me." Yingjie Samurai, who has not lost more than his strength!” Gulz shook his beard. “Why, do you think I am old? Take me to sign up!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the inability to stop, Luo Khan had to respond. "There are many people there, I will go alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?" Gulze swept his eyes. "Are you?" Anything else didn't tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Luohan hesitated for a while before whispering, "I saw the three sisters." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the crowd?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," the eldest son shook his head. "She is... In the painting, wearing undressed clothes, people are pointing around..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!" Gulze brows suddenly wrinkled, is the chieftain Is this humiliating her? After the last letter to Luo Jia, no winter city quickly responded, and he thought that she would not be thin. If Luo Jia’s humiliation is only for the status of the fanatic clan, he would rather not have the green mountains and green waters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he calmly walked toward the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lohan said the picture was hung on the side of the square, looking very eye-catching, and more than one pair - when Gulz saw it, The body could not help but stay in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...Luo Jia? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time he saw his daughter so beautiful - she stood in the white snow, and the white gauze and brocade fluttered in the wind. It was the court dress that Luo Jia never crossed. When she was in Tiesha, she always wore the shortest cloth pants that were most suitable for fighting. The chest and hands and feet were bandaged, not covered with dust and blood. When she does not need to fight, she packs herself tightly and hides the non-human characteristics under the thick clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lohan said this is not covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia exposes the fluffy ears and tails, and is unobtrusive, as if deliberately noticeable, she wears on one of her long ears. The crystal-clear ruby ​​earrings, the bright color seems to make the whole picture come alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no disgust and rejection in the surrounding people, and the voice of praise occupies the vast majority, which is the most unexpected point for Gulze. In addition, in their conversation, he also heard a fresh word: the shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
