			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy found that he could not get faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If it is faster, you can create a spear that breaks Maggie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If it is faster, you can rush back to the demon in front of Elena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If it is faster, it will be able to block the attack of the madman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic is running wildly in her body, strengthening each of her muscles and bones, and burning her nerves. The pain did not weaken her will, but instead focused her attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it's faster, then!! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egree has already entered the new field when it first played against the demon, even further. The flow rate of time has become slower in her eyes. She can clearly see every detail of the battlefield, such as the wear crack on the bone spear, the shoal of water at the foot of the devil, the undulating undulation of Maggie's chest. The blood from the body of Yi and so on, and responded one by one. Or kill the enemy with a sword, or help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels that the magic of the outside world is constantly pouring into the body and condensing in all parts of the body - perhaps this is the promotion mentioned by Ai Gesha, she thinks, herself Maybe it has reached that stage. The magic of cohesion not only provides her with powerful power, but also brings a keen sense that she can still face the two high-level devils at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but only so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Big Sword and the Demon's arm are slamming together , 迸 shot a series of Mars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter, is this your fastest speed?" Before the ashes took the sword back, Erskuk had already flew back and met. Lucy laughed. "Only this level, your companions will die here sooner or later. Or do you want to give up on them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash is deaf, Turned and fell, a spear shot to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't listen to it fart, this damn monster wants to irritate you and make you lose your mind!" Zoe panted and pressed the remaining bullets into the bomb Nest, you can see that there is very little ammunition in her hand. "If the impulse is chased out, then it will lose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Nodded calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of the other party is very obvious - it always looks for the gap in the team to initiate a raid, and the devil will also follow the cover or storm, with little delay. . Even if it is facing the bombardment of a shotgun, there will be no hesitation in the madness that rushes up. As long as she is slightly distracted, she may be torn apart by the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more than one hundred people who have hidden it are the most elite troops in the Takira garrison. If it weren’t for the eight Tacula witches who were also experienced fighters, they could not support them now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is nothing wrong with the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed her fastest speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is at this moment, every inch of her skin seems to be burning, this is the sign of magical counter-attacks - for those who are tempering themselves all the time In this case, the ashes are still encountered for the first time. If you stop now, turn around and break through the encirclement of the enemy, and concentrate on self-cultivation for a while. When the body is fully adapted to the new magic intensity, then she will be able to take it to the next level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that makes no sense for the dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can’t save anyone, she can only keep herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To turn things around, it’s not something that can be done simply by speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably changed to the king of the witch, Akaris, is there a better way? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was this moment that the ashes discovered that the hurdle that they had to face was quite different from what she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two roads in front of her, one side is to live and reunite with Tilly, the other side is to go further and reach a new field that has never been reached before. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price is to burn herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we are eager to use magic to achieve a certain purpose, it will lead us in that direction." The voice becomes chaotic and distant, as if from the sky It came - it was like a whisper and a thunder in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What exactly do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look here, open fire!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boom-!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explosion that has been silent for a long time suddenly re-sounds, Accompanied by the devil's scream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash looked at the sound and found that the lightning broke into the battlefield from behind the encirclement! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy who was attracted by Mai Mai and was completely unprepared ate a grenade, and the first and foremost madman was suddenly smashed half a body. The two that stood close to it were penetrated by sputtered shrapnel and instantly lost their fighting ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“嗷嗷嗷————!” Then Lin’s drilled an amazing beast, facing the devil who turned his head to aim at lightning. Bumping and biting, the students came out with a road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the mutual cooperation of the two, the encirclement has become chaotic for a time, and only the remaining twenty madmen have folded five or six. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Keep it, let's help!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annoying flies, "The demon person frowned, opened the confrontation with the ashes, and flew straight toward the lightning and the wheat." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other high-order devil is holding a giant tree to the ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are two bone spears that have already flown halfway, a pair of Zoe standing barely, one pointing straight to the ground Andrea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave, then lightning is dangerous. If you intercept the demon, everyone is dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since faster speeds are powerless, the only thing that can change this is the power above speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment Ashes made a decision when they saw the two men returning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this decision has already been made, every night and night spent with the Witchless Witches, on the night of talking with Felice, or When Tilly said "I like to see you what you are now than the Avengers," this idea already exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, Tilly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy whispered, then took that step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What exactly do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to protect them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, she "sees" a sea of ​​magical powers, the power of which is difficult to describe in words, but under the rapids, It seems to hide countless whispers and gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash releases the restrictions and fully accepts it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half of the heart of Erskuk suddenly alarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It slammed his head and found that the extraordinary man raised her big sword and pointed straight to the sky - and there was a golden light on the blade. Rogue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of the surrounding air is thick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is not the first time that Erskuk has seen it, but it can happen at this moment but it gives birth to an incredible feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——How is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the power of the magic stone, but from herself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It tried to raise his head and hoped that he had the wrong direction, but the golden electric light that was rolled over the dome shattered its last fluke. From the intensity of the magic gathering, the power of this attack is even above the red-haired witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing is no longer possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to stop, you will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awareness of this point of Erskuk exhausted all strength, opened up the field of interference! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the other party also slashed the big sword -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dazzling electric light for a moment Piercing the sky and illuminating the entire land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a dead silence, 岚 suddenly opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up from her seat, avoiding those who were still, walking step by step to the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world has not yet awakened, and everything remains at the moment when time solidifies, whether it is pouring champagne from a bottle or falling raindrops outside the window. . They are suspended in the air, like a stroke in the background of the dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In places where time is stagnant, there should be no sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the dark night, there is a faint thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pushed open the window and looked at the distant horizon somehow, for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When lightning recovered from the dazzling electro-optic, he was surprised to find that In the open space of the fierce battle, this moment has become a scorched earth. There was only one tree rooting in the surrounding trees, and the air was filled with a pungent smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened in the end? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She only remembers that a madman hiding behind a tree suddenly rushed toward herself, and she put all her attention on the demon, and noticed It is close at hand. In desperation, she had to throw the launcher at the other side, hoping to block the enemy, and then the golden light shrouded her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, except for the two high-level devils opposite the open space, the remaining enemies are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big head transformed by the Lord of Hell is on the ground, and it is burnt by the heat. The rough skin is cracked by an inch. It seems that There is only one breath left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer does not look much better. Its half body disappears completely, and the dark black light squirms in the wound, standing still in place. I don't know why, lightning still feels a little uncontrollable fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right... Ashes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly looked toward the center of the open space, and then could not help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The familiar figure is still standing upright with the sword, keeping everyone behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're okay--" Lightning flew to the side of Ash, and was interrupted by the other party's low drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get away with everyone, the farther away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
