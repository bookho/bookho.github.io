			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six-headed whole cow was transported by the cart to the campfire - if it wasn’t for the militia escort, Roland suspected that when the cart crossed the crowd, the whole cow would Will be cleaned up by the enthusiastic masses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the entire inventory in the basement of his castle. I don’t think I have any steaks before the next merchant ship arrives. Roland feels tears in my heart. In order to do this celebration, he was able to pull out the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal chef brought by Wang Du was only responsible for the smearing and supervision of the fire, and the barbecue task was handed over to the six people in the militia team to complete. An iron rod was inserted into the body from the mouth of the cow and placed on the brick platform beside the fire. The flames are burning, and you can feel the heat waves coming from two or three meters away. Soon the whole cow's skin emits a sizzling sound, and the oil emerges from the pores, giving off a seductive scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, when you are grilling, you can't let everyone wait. Under Roland's instructions, the iron axe comes with a team of militia members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gorgeous and complicated court dances are not suitable for such occasions. Without long training, even the essentials of the action may not be remembered, let alone show Beautiful dance. To ensure that you can express yourself at the same time, Sandman's dance is obviously more in line with the tastes of ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the iron axe and the players with their hands on their hips, one of which crossed the arms of the right companion, forming a ring-like pattern, surrounding the fire. In two circles. As the accompaniment—that is, several high and low horns blew, they began to move clockwise. Each time they stepped, the other kicked forward and shouted “Hello!”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the lead dance you said?" Carter widened his eyes. "Is this a dance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Of course, and simple and easy to remember, the militia team only took a quarter of an hour to master the pace last night," Roland laughed. "Do you want to go and try it?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter shook his head and refused. He only felt that there was something in his heart that shattered and shattered - no, the exciting girl, no, the sad, youthful memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other militia members patted their palms and followed the dancers' footsteps, bringing a round of applause for each round. The rhythmic rhythm of the rhythm led the masses, and they all reached out to do it. As the applause became faster and faster, the iron axe and the player's rotation speed became higher and higher, and the human ring began to show signs of disentanglement. Not long after, a team member accidentally fell, and then a group of people fell down and swayed. stop. The masses were stunned, but the applause of the militia did not stop, but instead became like a storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe helped the fallen player and shouted to the crowd: "Do you understand? Who wants to try it? If it falls, it will end!" Those who join the dance can all get a sweet and delicious honey barbecue. The longer they stick, the more meat they have!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is for nobles and big families Inviting, the townspeople will not necessarily participate actively - in the subconscious, they are always on the high, regard the civilian population as a mustard, and it is also common to repent. But when I saw the militia members, that is, the familiar neighbors who were familiar with the week, when they were beckoning themselves, they couldn’t help each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the first one, there will soon be a second, third. A new round of dance started again, but this time, most of the dancers were replaced by the masses. Despite the simple movements, everyone enjoyed it, plus honey barbecue as a reward, participants all showed the best performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly what Roland wants to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to barbecue, there are also bread, fish cakes, ale, which will be distributed after the distribution of beef, the celebration will continue until the evening, but Roland will not stay it's here. He arranged for Carter to be responsible for on-site safety, and the assistant minister came to the closing speech and then left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also had a private celebration feast to attend, in the back garden of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the evening comes, the backyard is still brightly lit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As in the middle of the square, there is also a bonfire here. The difference is that the chicken used for the barbecue is all cut into pieces. The seasoning and oil are also configured by themselves, completely imitating the way the wild barbecue is eaten. This novel way of self-help makes the witches love it. Of course, in the eyes of Roland, it is also a rare wonder. For example, Anna puts the chicken pieces in the sauce and wraps them directly with green fire. Spicy chicken. The nightingale showed her incredible knife skills. When the knife was in her hand, it was hidden. The chicken was rolled up and down. After peeling off, the bone fell completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
