			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil just raised his head and was thrown into the ground by the cockroach that fell to the ground. The strong impact made the nightingale feel the ground tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the ordinary person slams like this, I am afraid that the bones of the whole body will be crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job, McMug!" The leaves clenched fists, "Step on it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Bite with your mouth, pump it with your tail!" Even Effie shouted excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗷!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜 smugly stunned and put down Aegusa Ready to get up and make persistent efforts, the deformation was suddenly lifted - the fierce beast disappeared without a trace, the little girl fell to the ground and suddenly did not understand what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"斩魔者!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha took the lead in reacting, a cone of ice rising from the ground Since then, the devil who just got up has been flying out of the top and has broken several trees in succession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not give the enemy a breather, catching up and freezing its feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"趁now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returned to the wheat, pulled out the pistol, aligned The target of the unmovable bombs was fired continuously, the nightingale biting the lips, and the new bullets were replaced, allowing Yifei to help himself and join the fire suppression. The devil's armor continued to show a shining barrier, but it quickly weakened, and the red light in its eyes was looming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy snarled in a hoarse voice, waving his hand toward Ai Gesha, flying her out of the air, and the ice crystals under her feet disappeared instantly. Then it vacated and swayed to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Absolutely not let it go!" Aegusa shouted, "Mc!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Let me come!" The leaf grabbed the divine inscription in Anna's hand and penetrated the magic all the way - although she was forcibly stripped from the heart of the forest, the magic did not have much loss, and it was able to test it on weekdays. Stable to illuminate the fourth jewel. Soon the golden light once again flooded the woods, and the devil turned back and made a weird cry, seemingly unbelievable to this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden Thunder is swallowed up instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, it didn’t last longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Devil... is it dead?" asked the nightmare weakly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only half of the armor left!" McMug dragged the "enemies" that were shot down, if not the exquisite carvings on the edges, very It is hard to believe that this group of black and black charred objects is the devil's body. Obviously it is not as strong as previously thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning was also found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the enemy releases the black ripples, the little girl is affected, such as bricks falling directly, and the head stuns on the branches. Fortunately, at that time, the ground was not high, and the dense branches and leaves were used as buffers. Except for a large bag on the top of the head, there was no other injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably not able to participate in the battle, she looked very annoyed, confirmed that everyone is okay after frustration, "I will inform Brian, let him send someone to pick up "You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You actually survived," Ai Gesha exclaimed. "This is a miracle."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because a devil in the district is so embarrassed, I don't know how to report it to Roland." The nightingale sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...this is definitely not a general victory. You must know that the enemy is a demon!" Aegusa shook his head again and again. "Perhaps several high-level The witch can fight against a high-level demon, but there is absolutely no way to defeat a demon. It can only be compared with it. Only the consortium has three seats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
