			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia carefully placed three iron ingots on the floor of the bedroom, then closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and reviewed the past practice in my mind. Once again, only reach out and release the ability to surround the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the practice that Anna helped her figure out. The iron ingots are also made by Anna. The three wrought irons contain different ingredients and are melted together. Silver, copper, lead, and some impurities. What she has to do now is to restore it to a simple substance while retaining the impurities and find the iron ingot with the highest silver content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means she has to control the magic output and only do one action on the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, the impurities will be further dissociated - this is why she felt that her ability was difficult to control when she was at her home in Jinsuicheng. The same is the paper, the restored product is completely different, that is, they do not understand the relationship between the magic size and the ability effect, resulting in some paper being continuously differentiated several times, and finally most of the raw materials become water and gas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After coming to Bianbu Town, the witches taught her the first lesson, which was to control their magic in practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia didn’t believe that this invisible and intangible thing could be precisely controlled until Anna demonstrated the length of the black fire on the spot. She discovered that she was really wrong. The opponent can even change the size and thickness of the black fire by adjusting the magic output, and the accuracy can be accurate every time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister, start practicing again?" The bell curiously poked his head out of bed. "This is just after lunch."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia's hand trembled, and an iron ingot suddenly became a powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said, don't bother me when I use my ability," she said, knocking back her sister's head and "focusing on your book!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand," Bell snorted. "Half of the words don't understand the meaning. I don't like the sister, I can read and write." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you have to look at it. Many words have a similar structure. You should be able to guess what it means even if you haven't seen it. Literacy itself is a Familiar with the process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the bell retracted her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia refocused her attention on the second iron ingot, controlling the magic flow slowly, thinking of it as a layer of tulle in her mind, gently Cover the target and wrap it evenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I am coming," the door suddenly slammed open and a blonde woman swayed into the room. "Hey, you are practicing yourself." The ability?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night sister!" The bell rang out loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second iron ingot is again turned into a powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia sighed and put all the metal scrap on the ground into the skin. She felt that she might not be able to practice at noon today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, give it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ice cream with a fragrant milk flavor Handed to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," Lucia took the ice cream. "But isn't this only available in the afternoon tea?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night slaps his chest smugly. "This is the reward I asked for from my Highness, right...you have a share." She handed another one to the bell, and the little girl laughed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The night sister is the best for me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy has a delicious Just after I left myself, Lucia thought helplessly. But when the ice cream is put into the mouth, she feels that if she is a sister, the reaction will be the same as the bell - the mellow honey and milk taste will open in the mouth, and the cold and refreshing taste will be more It is to combine the two together to make the sweetness further enlarged. Even if you swallow it, you can leave a cool linger between the lips and teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Lucia couldn't help but ask, "How did you ask your Highness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," the nightingale curled up his mouth, "This test I ranked third in the score, second only to Wendy and the leaves, but Roland also thought that I could not pass. There is such a big deviation from the actual situation, I naturally want to ask him for rewards."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out...so," she hesitated for a moment, "Where, me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"68 points, I am not sure about the first few."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, good." Lucia frustrated. A total of 120 questions, I only answered more than half of the questions, which is based on the already literate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not bad," the nightingale patted her head. "After all, you didn't take the class for a long time. The math and the natural part will definitely be a little bit worse. You can ask me if you understand the problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me! I can ask!" Bells raises the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," the nightingale smiled and said, "Always welcome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for me After passing the elementary assessment, can you choose your own work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are still early, Your Highness said that the minimum period of participation in the work must be over ten. Four years old, you are only ten years old, what anxious." Lucia gave her a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl refused to show her weakness, "I want to help you share the pressure earlier. If you are married or have a child, you will have to spend a lot of money. If If the money is not enough, the days will be very bitter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you listening to?" Lucia helped the forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dad, he often can't afford us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hey," Nightingale couldn't help but laugh. "If you can get into the work, where would you choose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chemistry Lab!" Bells Handwriting, "I want to be an alchemist, get the title of sage, accept everyone's admiration and preach!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...better, don't," She shook her head. "The laboratory is actually very dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Danger?" The two sisters said the same thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah," the nightingale, "not only often dealing with acid, sometimes exploding, even the chief alchemist can not avoid accidents, Last time I was blown off four fingers. If it weren’t for Nana Va, I’m afraid Mr. Camo Spoel couldn’t pick up the bottles and jars for the rest of his life.” She paused, “and my Royal Highness recently It seems that he intends to develop a new gunpowder. Even he thinks that this thing is extremely dangerous. It is necessary to vacate a laboratory to prepare it separately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hey, in this case, do you have any good suggestions?" Lucia slammed the bell and made up her mind that she must not let her sister work in such a terrible place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, enter the City Hall, be a civil servant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Official staff ?" she repeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, this is what the Highness said when talking to himself. Popularly speaking, it is the City Hall official," the nightingale coughed twice, "still stable." And safe, the salary is in the upper level, but the prospects are good. If you are the head of the department, the reward will not be lower than the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out," West Asia has some thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Night sister, do you like your Highness?" Bell said. "You have a lot of words in your words, "Your Highness says," Mom said, only people who like it very much. Will often hang on my lips. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister's problem makes Lucia look stiff, damn, how can this kind of thing be directly asked, it is too rude. Even ordinary friends can't Asking directly, not to mention the other person is a senior who admired himself. She panicked and covered her mouth, and when she planned to apologize, she heard the nightingale replied frankly-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
