			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you guessed it," Roland said after a moment of silence. "But at this point, the dream world is the key to guiding the rapid development of the winter city." I can't...and should not unilaterally close the channels that enter it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially after the book was promoted to supernatural, the meaning of the dream world has changed. Unprecedentedly important, every time she enters the conscious world, she can bring an inestimable knowledge to mankind. Moreover, there are Jieluo, Jiaxia, and the guardian meteorite... He can no longer treat them as fictional illusions. Even without the embarrassing factor, Roland is not willing to abandon the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale’s hand is tight, “What about me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is a little bit stunned, "What..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do I do!" Her voice suddenly increased, and the words finally brought a tremolo. "If time is shortened again, Going on, after a few years, you will --" Nightingale bites his lips, as if he used all his strength to cut off the second half of his sentence in the throat. "Anna and I have agreed, I am willing to follow the agreement, but if so Less than that day, I – what should I do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland raised his hand and gently stroked her biting white lips "So I need to enter the dream to end it all. You know, the numbers don't just increase, it's just a trend, not a result. If you can uncover the essence of the source of magic, these are around the conscious world. Adverse effects have a great chance to disappear. On the contrary, if you just avoid it, it may be intensified at some point, and then wait until then. It’s too late.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the warning is true, the patience of the gods is almost empty, and any decision to give time to the time is possible. Incurs destruction. The frequent appearance of the demon and the gods seems to prove this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must take this risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promise not to let that happen." Roland is serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night gaze at him for a long time, "No matter what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Anyway." He nodded . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter did not pick up again, her figure faded away until she disappeared completely in the fog. Roland put the magic stone into the drawer, and the darkness quickly occupied every corner of the room. The glimmer on the glass window restored the previous color, and everything seemed to have never happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he knows that those are not hallucinations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand on the side of the body, the gentle touch has not disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Before he fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drip, you have a text message not checked."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drip, you have a text message not checked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who? Texting so hard?" Fiji Han took care of the final dress in front of the mirror. "Is it a person in the association?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay..." Wajiris hates Open the mailbox and bite it to close it. If you don't deliberately control the power, the gadgets in your hand may have been torn apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does it mean?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The man has a vision." Fiji smiled and put on fluffy gloves. "You didn't notice that the number of eyes cast at you at the martial arts conference is second only to me?" Most people just dare to look at it. They can take the lead to send courage to send you messages. Of course, it is worthy of praise. If you have time, you may also introduce me to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not what you think," Wajiris replied angrily. After she was discharged from hospital, she lived in the same building because of the group relationship and Feiyu. The two people's bedrooms were connected to a large living room. It is clear that there is any movement between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was annoyed by the sender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that this small box called the mobile phone is definitely an artifact-level treasure, through which you can search most of the things you want to know. Knowledge is a true encyclopedia compared to paper books. Since playing Fiji to teach her how to use this "communication tool", she can no longer put down her mobile phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is not without flaws, such as when the number is known to others, it becomes very annoying. Even more unpleasant is that she can't easily block each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, you don't care about this matter." Wakiris smashed his forehead and lost three eyes. She always felt that she was missing something. "Do you want to go out now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the association recently recruited a new person and guarded me to let me see her."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Newcomer?" Wakiris raised his eyebrows. She naturally knows that Fiji’s status in the martial arts association is unusual. The reception of newcomers should not require her to come forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, after all, I am the one who will be her master." The other smiled and then waved out the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master ............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiri has a moment, and there are thousands in his mind Shaped figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this surge of emotions was interrupted by the hum of the phone for only one second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drip, you have a text message not checked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drip, you have A text message has not been checked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-This guy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pinches her fist and waits for a long time before she opens the inbox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sender: Roland. Your invading troops were attacked by our army in the south of the wolf heart. The front line was almost defeated, and the casualties were close to 100,000. The giant skeleton of the fog has also lost a few, and the Lord of Scorpio has disappeared. Is it scared by the artillery? And where are the monarchs going? If not, the group of vanguards will all be buried. In the wolf heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sender: Roland. We have discovered the Blackrock Obelisk on the continental spine, attacking it is only sooner or later. What do you think will happen if you put the incendiary bomb into the big pit? Although the distance is a bit far, the aircraft that can sail long distances are already under development. If you can't end the battle of divineness as soon as possible, the same scene will be Repeatedly until the Blackrock Field becomes a never-extinguishing volcano, I hope you can understand this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sender: Roland. By the way, come Dream world has been around for so long, you should also understand What kind of height can the class reach on the weapon? And one of the peaks of this mountain, the sun's glow, has been tested in principle not long ago, and it is only one step away from the world. You still want to continue to consider it. "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;News like this, she can receive several articles every day, not the frontline war, the latest research results of human beings. Before Wajilis remained silent, neither refused nor replied, but this time she gaze at the screen for a long time and slowly pressed the reply button. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you? Let's meet and talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forward: Where are you? Let's meet and talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same information also appeared in Fiji on the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it seems that today I can learn a lot about the new world. She closed the screen with pleasure and rang the door of the guard office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in." There was a calm voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
