			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have to arrest all the prisoners so that they no longer dare to show up in Wintertown!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale holds Axia’s shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, yes...night slut," Axia shrank back and forth, "but now I am going to sleep..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also early, let us think about tomorrow's countermeasures," her eyes sparkling. "No one can escape our hunt, even the most awkward mouse!" By the way, you don't have to call me an adult. The Alliance Witch is used to being a sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...night sister."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, Axia does not know that he is an ordinary town, how can he suddenly arrest the criminals, isn't that what the patrol should do? And after returning from the study of His Royal Highness the prince, the nightingale adults... No, the night sister has always been very excited, just to grasp the prisoners personally, they have turned over and over and said it several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that she is indeed a haterful witch, Axia feels in her heart, just herself... can she help her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, she cautiously asked, "What should we do? I have never caught a prisoner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Capturing the murderer is my task," the night slap patted the chest. "You just have to reproduce the scene of the murder, let everyone see who is the real murderer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean to reproduce the moment when the prisoner took the shot?" Axia hesitated. "How can I know, when did the other party start?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃"" The nightingale sounds a meal, "Say it is. Can you perform several times a day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I have been practicing with Wendy for a week, and I can use it four times now, but this should be the limit," Axia said with dismay. "My magic is very limited. If I want to extend the illusion time, I have to count the number of times. In addition, the time can not exceed two days, otherwise the speed of magic consumption will increase significantly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Half, a quarter of an hour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔...not too much Enough," Nightingale walked around the bed. "If the moment of reappearance does not include the prisoner, it will be troublesome." She thought for a while, "If you reduce the duration, can you try more?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should be...but I don't know if I can do it," Axia whispered. "Wenty said that as long as the magic is precisely controlled, Feel free to control the ability to display time, but every time I use magic, I always feel that it runs fast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately Count Sper is not here," her The look looks a little regrettable. "In this case, we infer a time and then try our luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Touch...take luck?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm!" the other party laughed. "My luck has always been good! Otherwise I will not meet Roland." Speaking of her here. Air suddenly went down part of it, "...... Unfortunately, a few days late." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; it also called luck, okay! Axia’s heart seemed to have a voice shouting, how to see this luck can’t stand it! Don't say a few days later, even at half an hour in the evening, your ability is meaningless... Hey, can you catch the prisoner tomorrow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, sleep." The nightingale blew the candle, and the night suddenly poured in from the window and filled the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," she bowed her head and climbed onto the big bed, instantly feeling herself surrounded by a soft bedding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, is this the bed used by the nobility? It’s too comfortable, Axia buried her head in a pillow without any odor, feeling the slight depression of the body, and the whole person stretched out. After a while, the deep sleepiness hit her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
