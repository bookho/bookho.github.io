			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swan went west along the Chishui River, and Mey stood at the bow and looked straight ahead. She is not trying to appreciate the scenery, just want to see the pier in Bianbu Town earlier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long will it take us to get to the destination?" she asked impatiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s almost, Miss Mey. The sun is here, you are still going back to rest," said Gate behind him. I don’t have to look at it, he knows that he is a good smile at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going back, Mey found out that it was, "You told me when it was already fast, is it still fast? You have never been here." Bentham Town?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." He was dumbfounded for a long time, and finally scratched his head. "I was last ten years ago."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A year can make a long song fortress change a master, let alone ten years?" Mayi annoyed, "but there are exceptions, I see you have nothing to change, ten years as one Day, I can't get on the stage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was finally comfortable when she saw the other side stiff and smiled. If it wasn't for Irene's news, she really didn't want to go to Bianbu Town with this group of actor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the star female actor of the Fortress Theatre, she is well-known throughout the West. This time, she was invited by the Grand Tower Theatre to perform at the Grey Castle. "The Prince finds love". The performance was a great success. Even the master of the drama, Mr. Kajin Fez, praised her for playing the role of the lyrical princess. Although she did not play the heroine, she was impressed by the heroine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when she rushed back to the Long Song Fortress, she found that earth-shaking changes have taken place. The Duke of Ryan was defeated and died. The fortress fell into the hands of the four princes Roland Wimbledon. He is currently hosted by Pedro Helmon of the honeysuckle family... When he left less than a year, the Westland became strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the political turmoil at the upper level has little effect on the theater. If this is the case, it will only add a little after-meal talk to Mey and the sisters. The news that a knight was captured in the morning light suddenly smashed her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei immediately rushed to the theater, looking for Irene to ask about the situation, and found that she also went to Bianbu Town half a month ago, probably for the same Husband reunion. This news made Mei Yi feel disappointed, but also mixed with a little envy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same work in the theater, she is a well-deserved head card, Irene is a newcomer who has not yet made a fuss, the title of tomorrow's flower is only from the group of actor's touting each other On the appearance, she has the confidence to never lose to the other side; on the family, although she is a civilian, but Irene is just an orphan adopted by the theater, how to look better than the other side. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is difficult for Mey to let go, the dawn of the morning, Feilin Hilter likes it, but it’s the look of Irene, afterwards. She even gave up the family's inheritance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look, farmland," someone shouted. "We are not far from the border town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mei looked to the left side of the ship's side, only to see a row of wheat straw that had not been over the knees, and the farmers wore straw hats in the field, as if they were in the turquoise sea. The wheat field stretches westward with the sparkling river water, and you can't see the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This scene is so beautiful, Miss Mey," Luo Xia came over and nodded to her. "I didn't expect to see it in this remote place." To the vast farmland that is not inferior to the long song fortress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is nothing compared to the king," Mey did not think, "Where, the wheat field It is even possible to connect the two cities, and it is boring to see the wheat and wheat along the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," she smiled slyly "I have never been to such a long distance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唔, this is the reaction that ordinary people should have, Mayi thinks, if it is Irene. When you hear this, I am afraid that I will only show an envious expression and ask myself to tell more. "Don't worry, you have a chance to go later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hope so," Luo Xia patted the chest, "Thank you for your encouragement."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
