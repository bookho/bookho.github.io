			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, or not?" After everyone boarded the plane, Tilly walked to Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s clear that one day, every sentence is explained It’s like a goodbye, it’s not to be seen.” She shrugged. “Are you doubting my technique, or are you doubting Anna’s ability?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this Roland was only able to report a bitter smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure of the seagull is extremely simple. Except for a few operating levers and the corresponding movable rudder surface, it is basically a container for loading people. Its essence is not more complicated than the test model. Where to go. With Anna's processing skills, it is difficult to come up with problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also tested several times after it was built, and it also simulated the emergency landing, the results are very satisfactory - Tilly's extremely powerful control ability is not It is said that Wendy has made great progress in the running-in, and the airflow that always appears in the right position keeps the aircraft stable at all times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the safety of the voyage, the passengers also brought the Sawyer and Molier, which is foolproof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even so, he still feels nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are half of the elite witches in the Winter City on a brand new aircraft, and go alone to the wild hinterland 500 kilometers away, which is enough reason to be worried. . If there is not much work to be done without Wintertown, he even wants to go with the Seagull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After gently exhaling the gas, he looked at Tilly. "I think it should be irrelevant to doubt, but I care too much. I hope that you can all be safe." Nothing to live in the new era after the end of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After watching the moment, Tilly opened her head. "Know it, I just opened it." It’s just a joke... If it’s me, it’s going to be uncomfortable.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for Roland to react, she has turned and stepped on the ramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So then I am leaving, brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the door was closed, a guard came over. "Your Majesty, everything is ready outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland Take a deep breath and condense back, "Get started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the password is released, the procedures are working in an orderly manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The stopper is open!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The road is empty!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All personnel leave the runway!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open the library door!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the hangar door slowly slides to the sides, the dazzling sunlight shines into the room, reflecting a light path on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader lifted the green flag high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seagull, can take off!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the whistle sounds Throughout the airport -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland felt the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a wonderful feeling - he stood in a position that should have been absolutely windless, but still felt the tidal air flowing over his cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not fair to think of the Seagull as a pure glider to compare it with its kind, the latter trying everything to get it, it’s from one I have it at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, in the area affected by Wendy's ability, the direction and speed of the wind are controlled by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also means that the Seagull does not need to rely on the wings to maintain the flight, but also can make other gliders stunned, such as the near vertical vertical takeoff and landing - Speed ​​is just to get more lift. If you can get lift directly, speed is no longer an indispensable thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, such a fluttering fly away may be a terrifying feat in the eyes of the experts, but in the eyes of the layman, it is obviously lacking a point. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more than a tens of tons of big guys, screaming across the top of the head, and then slowly climb until it disappears in the clouds more shocking scenes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the thought of Tilly’s eagerness to present this idea, Roland shook his head in a funny way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that she has completely regarded the Seagull as her big toy and can’t wait to show off to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜——————呜——————" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as the whistle sounded, Goode also noticed the vision at the end of the Blackrock Road - the soldiers dispersed and the iron gate of the shed opened. A weird gray "giant bird" slipped out slowly, and after a small half turn, it took the road where they were. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, look, what is that?" Obviously, he alone discovered the giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Train? It’s not like... there are no rails on the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Presumably Newly invented machine?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Is it what the Eagles say?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems to be coming over to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, this thing he seems to have seen! Goode had a hard time thinking about it, and suddenly there was a flash of light in his mind - didn't there be a similar cover picture in the books given by His Royal Highness? Like a bird and a bird, the slender symmetrical wings seem to be a bit like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little thought, he thinks that the two are simply not right. Not to mention the difference in the shape and the number of wings. On that cover, he can at least see the driver, and can understand the reason why the objects in the picture seem to float in the air - after all, the skeleton support is not much bigger than the people. A pair of huge wings, in a sense, is a magnified kite. Although knowing what the king and the princess value is certainly not so simple, it is reasonable to be able to figure it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing in front of you is entirely of a type that cannot be figured out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the contrast of the surrounding soldiers, it can be seen that its head is far above the former, except for the wings, the whole body is round and round, and the whole body is wrapped tightly. The slender belly seems to be able to stuff a lot of things. According to this figure, let alone fly, even climbing on the ground should be very difficult -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the next moment, Gude found his own ideas How ridiculous it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party started to accelerate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and soon exceeded the speed of the horse running, and did not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning, they also talked about the various teams, and they all quieted down unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone heard the roar of the far and near. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God..." Fingin swallowed. "It has to hit us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the feeling shared by most of the students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intellectually, as long as you stand still, the two don’t really hit each other, but the reason is rational, and everyone’s body seems to be uncontrolled. Trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
