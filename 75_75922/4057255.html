			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time Felice felt that waiting was so difficult, I thought it was after four After a hundred years of tempering, time has become the least thing that she cares about. I didn't expect her to feel restless in just one morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Sellin’s statement is correct, finding the chosen person means the end of the war of divineism—the sacred instrument can destroy all the devils, and her mission is also This is the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the body made by the church, most of the survivors will continue to sleep, and this time it is likely that there will be no more awakened day; or Combine the soul with Eleanor and contribute his last remaining heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the thought of this, she will have an inexplicable and complex feeling in her heart, in addition to the long-awaited relief, there is also a trace of reluctance. Life that is imprisoned in the empty shell, even if it can continue, is a torment, and when the war is over, she will be able to usher in a true rest. But when she thought that she would close her eyes forever, and could no longer see Tacula repeating the glory of the world, she felt that it was difficult to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two contradictory emotions took turns to impact her until the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ready?" Wendy appeared in the castle hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also available," Felice stood up immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Wendy’s leadership, she crossed the back garden In the middle of a corridor made of olive trees, came to a small open space. Under the shadow of the surrounding fence and dense vines, she can only see a small piece of sky above her head and the "walking path" when she came. If you want to leave from here, you must return to the original route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice instantly realized the other’s intentions, and the observed witches appeared at the end of the gallery one by one. This distance did not affect the observation, but also guaranteed The security of alliance members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a change, this corridor is definitely an insurmountable gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice not only did not feel resentful, but instead looked at the mortal king a high point - at least he did not regard the witch as an optional accessory. His approach was impeccable until he was completely trusted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the Witch Alliance’s rating in her mind has risen to the level of the Holy City. If it is said that there are scales and means, it is still impossible for the witch organization to be suppressed by the world. Producing enough influence, and now with their share of the king's heart, this alliance has faintly shadowed by the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after Wendy left, the first witch soon appeared in her field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Ai Gesha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the youngest promoter of the Tacharia era summoned a piece of light blue ice crystals, Felice has completed observations, beams and wheat He is quite the same, not the one who she is looking for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the test was completed, Ai Gesha did not leave the promenade, but walked straight to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult?" Felice was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was also a member of the Quest Society. I am interested in such things as Magic Stone. Should you mind if I am watching?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not," Felice first shook her head, then greeted her with a high-level witch ceremony. "Yes, I haven't thank you yet." Help, if it’s not yours, I’m afraid I’m not so sure about the winner.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is also your own choice,” Ai Gesha Put on the hand, "Let's continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next witch At the end of the corridor, she showed her ability. She placed the ring between the two. In addition to the intensity of the light beam, Ai Gesha also recorded the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
