			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hovde Quin held a glass of wine and stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window of the study Staring at the city that was covered by the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the center of the morning sun and is also known as the city that never sleeps. The lights are centered on the Rising Sun Avenue and extend to the sides, such as the same leafy tree of light. The apex of the tree is the most famous hypermarket in the kingdom. Every day, countless treasures flow from all over the place. For businessmen, night is the beginning of their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to maintain this brilliance, the candles, firewood and lamp oil consumed by the king every day are an astonishing number, from the east bank of the fish fat, and the northern hills The firewood is continuously transported into the city by ships. It is this industry alone, and conservative estimates have supported nearly 10,000 people and more than a hundred businessmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just the corner of Wangdu’s commercial trade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s normal, one of the great pleasures of Hofford is to appreciate the night scene of the Glow City – the city’s common governance in the royal family of Moya and the three families. Next, from a wasteland to a well-known and prosperous place, there are constant contributions from the ancestors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, he is inexplicably tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night view of Huiguang City looks like the past, still beautiful and moving, but outside the range that Guangshu can’t shine, the faint undercurrent It can no longer be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in the face of such a brightly lit territory, he felt a strong uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably you are really old... Hoofd sipped a bit of wine, and the bitterness in his mouth seemed to be better than sweetness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father," the study door was pushed open, and a young man came in. "The Baron Alfons of the North Winds wants to meet." You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Hofford said without saying back, "I said that I am sick."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." He hesitated for a moment, then waved his hand at the old butler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter immediately nodded and turned and walked out of the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two of them left in the house, and the man is somewhat worried. "Father, this is already the twelfth aristocrat you refused. Even if it is I also know that there is a problem in the palace. The purpose of these foreign aristocrats entering the city is already obvious. If you do this, I am afraid they will be mistaken..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What's wrong with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I misunderstood..." He bit his lip. "You are still standing on the side of Ampein Moya." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Horn..." Earl Quin turned back and frowned at the Quin’s intended successor. "Do you think?" It is a mistake to have the three families of Glows standing on the side of the morning sun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But now it is no longer necessary for us," Horne took the courage. "Since the army suffered a fiasco in Hermes, he never consulted you again! You are a former prime minister, and you can’t even step into the palace and even patrol the outer city. The team was also replaced by a mercenary. You look at the people who are called into the castle every day by the king - he only needs clowns, monks and songs now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The count did not answer, but looked at the glass of silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horne is only 18 years old, even he can see what it means behind "the nobles from all over the world come to the kingdom", other local nobles can not be unaware To any change. In fact, when he learned the news of the defeat of the army, he expected the arrival of this day - more than 10,000 troops, most of the town's lords are involved, hoping to scrape a piece from the fallen giant Meat comes. However, the end result is that not only did everyone not get the slightest property, but they lost their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the case, the key is that the Lord of the Morning is alive and back, and his Knights are ruined. When Anpei wandered back to the kingdom, the news spread almost like a fly. This is equivalent to satisfying two conditions at the same time - someone needs to be responsible for this failure and unfulfilled promises; and the power that Anpein has, can no longer dispel the thoughts of other nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
