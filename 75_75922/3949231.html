			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefco.Wambuton sat on the throne, palms ruby ​​scepter, overlooking the ministers in the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I want, he thinks, not in Jinsuicheng, and the merchants are entangled in the interests of sesame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused the scepter, the pure gold handle and the smooth marble floor made a crisp collision, seeing everyone's eyes concentrated on himself, he little Head, "Get started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, I have something to report." The first to speak is Sir Weimas, nicknamed "Steel Knight" Responsible for the defense of Wang Cheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can the witch hunting stop temporarily? Your Majesty, recently The search has been getting bigger and bigger. Yesterday I heard that some women in civilian houses were arrested and insulted in the dungeon, and one person died in prison. Afterwards, they proved that they were not witches. Now the whole outer city is already heart-wrenching. If you go on like this, I am afraid that there will be a large number of fugitives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefco frowned, and the witch’s search was his request. The death of Wimbledon III has not yet been able to ascertain the truth, but he never thought that his father would commit suicide, especially the strange smile before death, which made him feel creepy. The father wears the highest quality stone of punishment, and the church also confirms that the stone has not been exchanged or invalidated. However, these do not indicate that the witch is not involved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to be surprised, no one can be better than the demon woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved his gaze to Langley, the hunter of the action, and his own minions. The latter immediately stood up. "Respected Majesty, it was just an accident. I have severely punished the relevant personnel," he said with a slap in the face. "The prison chief, the prisoner, and the guards were all sentenced to ten whippings, and Twenty-five silver wolves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One person died, the three suffered cruel torture, the villains took a few whip, and fined the matter?" Wei Ma Sir Sir Speaks coldly, "And, who gave you the right to decide? Is it the former Prime Minister Wick or the Minister of Justice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"陛下! very During the period, I had to be very good," Langley yelled on one knee. "Ignore some insignificant setbacks. The raids have been very successful. We have caught at least fifteen witches lurking in the city. I am being tortured and I will soon know if they are with your father - no, I mean, are there any plots?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He glanced at him, this idiot, almost said his intentions. Although most of the ministers standing in the hall can guess the true purpose of this action, it must be said that the big prince Goron has killed the king, and this cannot be overthrown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fifteen witches?" The steel heart knight laughed with a scornful tone. "Very good, the original king has become the base camp of the witch, a few years ago. Church in the forest habitat hunting Wang Guodong, the co-promoter was arrested six activists seems your men will henchman stronger than Verdict Church ah "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;.. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "You...!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough!" Langley was an idiot. Langley’s men were also idiots, and Tiffe was annoyed, if not No one was available at the beginning of the throne, he did not want to promote this fool. Even if you want to invite merit, it is not like this. I am afraid that most of these fifteen people are the same as those unlucky civilian women. He didn't want the church to get involved in the matter, but there is no other way at the moment. "You go to the church and ask the priest to let him confirm the identity of the fifteen people. Anything about the torture will stop. After that, every person you catch." , must be verified by a priest, if I let you hear of people uncontrollable Now, I'll throw you the king of the moat to feed the fish "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;!! & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "uh, yes, Your Majesty." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; <br /> <br /> & nbsp "immediately follow the above!"; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; let Portland After Lee rolled out of the hall, Tiefco turned to the finance minister. "If some of them are detained, together with the previous three, they will be compensated for two Golden Dragons. The one who died in prison will be sent to his family." paused, "multiple one." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ". as you wish," Finance Minister nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
