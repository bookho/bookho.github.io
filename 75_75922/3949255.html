			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the busy people around, the leaves didn’t expect to have a day close to the secular towns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the boundary of Bianbu Town, the low-rise brick-and-mortar bungalow was like a dusty memory, and appeared in front of her. It was less than half a year after she fled into the desolate mountains. She felt that the scene in front of her was stranger to another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon moon just passed, the townspeople spent the winter after eating and eating less, it should be very bad and the body is very bad, the leaves remember that the Communist Youth League had passed the silver light in winter. The slums of the city - there are hungry and frozen bodies everywhere, and the still alive people are like walking dead, numbness, and slow movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here, most of the people she meets are full of energy, some drying the fish at the door; some climbing the roof to repair broken tiles; More is a strong man carrying a hammer and a hammer. They talked and laughed and went to the north of the town. In this case, the leaves will pull down the cap and avoid as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the castle is striking, on a high hillside in the southwest corner of the town. There are no plants around that that can be used, and it is very difficult to sneak into it silently. It’s okay to hide in the trunk to avoid the enemy. It’s too big to let the tree climb up and send yourself in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not good at hiding the shape of the witch, after repeated consideration, the leaves feel that they are hiding and hiding, it is better to walk into the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the nightingale didn’t lie to her, there would be no problem even if I walked in from the main entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the nightingale deceived her, she deceived the sisters of the Communist Youth League, and she was sure to escape from the pursuit of the two guards in front of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the worst case is that the nightingale completely betrayed everyone, relying on the hunting witch to work for the prince, then he will die here. As the top-class combat witch, few people can escape the night and chase, even if it is as strong as Hakala, there is no grasp of victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves are ready for the worst. If she can't go back alive, the book will take over as a mentor and lead the sisters to go on – as far as the destination is, where are their destinations, no one knows the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly walked up the hillside, near the castle gate. The guard quickly noticed her, put his hand on the hilt and shouted loudly: "This is the prince's palace, not where you should come, back!" He paused and added, "If there is something important." To report, go straight to the left along this road and go to the town hall. There will be someone to receive you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves took a deep breath and took off their hood . Unsurprisingly, she saw the two people showing a surprised expression at the same time, waiting for the other person to come back, she said straightforwardly: "I am a witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; At the moment of this sentence, she was almost ready for the guards to pull the sword. But the two guards just looked at each other and there was no such thing as an ordinary person who could not conceal his disgust when he heard the witch. One of them even asked with great interest: "Witch, do you have anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of reaction makes the heartbeat suddenly increase, she is almost pressing The excitement that is about to erupt, says in the calmest tone: "I want to see the nightingale. Or Anna and Nanava can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the story of the nightingale, the witch is a frequent visitor in the castle. His Royal Highness does not imprison their freedom, and the guardian guarding the castle, under the direction of the four princes, turns a blind eye to them entering and leaving the place... If the nightingale is true, the guard They can't possibly hear their names. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard who asked the voice patted the shoulder of the partner. "You look at her here, I will inform my Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves saw him walking into the gate and soon disappeared into the garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait for what they are going to be, is the welcoming of the sisters, or the roundup of the guards, or the sharp edge from the shadows? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finds herself caught in a strange contradiction, clearly wanting to believe in the nightingale, but the closer she is to the answer, the more she is afraid of disappointment. Will the nightingale make a face-lift here, not calling this name at all? Will Anna and Nanava be made up by her? Or...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
