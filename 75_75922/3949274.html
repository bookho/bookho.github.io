			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the enemy appeared far in the field of vision, Fanner saw the heavily armed knights, riding high-headed horses, wearing shiny armor, slowly Approaching the town. Usually, a knight in the town is a high-ranking presence. Now, when I come out with nearly a hundred people, this scene makes him take a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna feels that his palms are sweating again, just like standing on the wall for the first time facing the evil beast, but this time, he is facing the same kind - - The aristocratic coalition of the Long Song Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, he spits and puts his thoughts aside, the same kind? When did the nobles treat you like this? He thought about himself. Their trip was to rob the border town and re-integrate the northern slope mining area into the fortress. More importantly, they actually intended to drive the prince out of the West. This is something that all members of the First Army simply cannot accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Royal Highness was very clear yesterday before the pre-war talks, and Tiefko Wimbledon, the brother of His Royal Highness, used the conspiracy to find the throne. Killed the old king Wimbledon III. Originally, there was nothing to say about the things between the royal family and the nobles. Who is the king to change? It was too much for the Duke of Klein to take this opportunity to take away the territory of His Royal Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about it, before the Highness did not come here, what is Bentham Town like? The former lord seems to be an earlord. He rarely sees it when he buys fur. He often uses the low price to buy good goods in the hands of the hunters. When the demon moon arrived, the first one escaped. The townspeople never asked when they suffered in the fortress slums. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Bianbu Town is getting better and better under the control of His Royal Highness, and these changes are all visible to everyone. Fanna thinks that the more miners produce, the more they get paid. After His Royal Highness put the black machine into the North Slope mine, the extra output was still counted on the miners' head. Whether it is building a city wall or a mine gravel, the remuneration of the villagers is paid on time. This winter, I didn’t even starve to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the biggest change is the militia team - no, the first army now. With them guarding the town, everyone does not have to huddle in the icy wooden shed in the winter, begging the big men to give a bite of food. If the prince is not there, will the Duke allow the First Army to exist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, take a deep breath and rub the hand sweat on the clothes. Of course they will not allow it. The fortress aristocracy does not care about the life and death of the townspeople. This is what the Highness said: Only an army composed of the people will be willing to fight for the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and looked to the left side of the sky. There was a faint black spot in the distance. If he looked at it inadvertently, he thought it was a huge bird. It was the shooting command of the artillery group - lightning, she used the woods on both sides of the road as a cover to observe the enemy's movements. When she flew back, Fanna also noticed that as long as she did not take the initiative to go to the open area, the people underneath would only see the branches on both sides, and it would be difficult to find the witches who were investigating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning once in a quarter of an hour, flew to a position closer to the front, showing a green ribbon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That represents the range of preliminary shots where the enemy has entered a kilometer. Fanna is still not sure how far the "one kilometer" in the mouth of the temple is, but when he sees the green signal, he subconsciously shouts the password for loading and adjusting the angle of the shot according to the rules of the comprehensive exercise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four guns quickly completed this set of action, the gunshot angle was adjusted to the third gear, gunpowder and solid shells have been filled into the cannon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that standing on the wall against the evil beast, it is already rich in experience, but Fanna found out today that he is still better than Iron Axe and Brian. It is far worse. When the afternoon array was assembled, his heartbeat had been difficult to stabilize. The two men led their respective teams into the shooting position. Not only did they look as usual, but he could even hear a glimmer from Brian’s voice. But until now, he still has not returned to calm, even the Rodney brothers seem to perform better than themselves. This made Fanna feel a little depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licked his dry lips and looked for lightning again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the enemy’s forward speed suddenly slowed down a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they doing?" Rodney asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
