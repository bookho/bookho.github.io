			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was the turn of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, Kaymo snorted, "His Royal Highness, I hope that you can find the real person in charge as soon as possible. I don't want to come back to this meeting. "Twice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Roland turned a blind eye and became a leader. He found that some words were selectively ignored, a pair of alchemy and Where are the talents involved in chemistry so easy to find? "Do you have a clue about the large-scale production of two acids?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Camo shrugged. "So I need to spend more energy." More people are trying to study this project instead of sitting here and wasting time. "In the town, I have been in the town for a long time. He also brought some "Roland-style vocabulary" in his words. "If I have to report it, I can only say The lack of people in the laboratory, the more people come in, the better. In addition, the five who have recently joined are not very young, but they are still smart. It seems that the primary education you got is still useful."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;å””, the chief alchemist is probably the most disrespectful of his words and attitudes, but considering the age of the other party and the enthusiasm for the chemistry experiment, Roland has no resentment. To know that he was experiencing an explosion and was completely cured by Nana, the first reaction was to test unscrupulously, and he also intended to taste the taste of different acids. This enthusiasm is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh... you continue to study, I will let Barov find a way to make up the gap."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Highness," Kemer said again. "Is your "Medium Chemistry" written? If you can give it to me, maybe I can think earlier. A large-scale acid production method."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said at the ceremony, as long as the apprentices and assistants you cultivate can fill the newly built laboratory. I will hand you the books," Roland said. In fact, this book is still not moving at all - just the first class chemistry has hollowed out his few chemistry knowledge, even if the medium chemistry is racking his brain, I am afraid that I can't make a few pages of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth place is Minister of Construction Carl Vabert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, I want to thank the adults under the book," he nodded to the book, "I was really happy to hear that the children were able to graduate." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing with the chief alchemist, Mr. Stonemason's socializing talent is a world of difference, and the book also nods to return to the ceremony, "This is what I should do." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Carl opened the notebook with him and said in an orderly manner: "Now the town's projects are progressing steadily, the main item is Kingdom Avenue, Chishui Bridge, new residential buildings and new city walls. The construction of Wangdao Avenue has reached 4,500 people, half of which comes from the Changge Fortress. It is expected to be completed next spring. Chishui Bridge is still under construction for underground cement wall. The house has been extended to the vicinity of the old city wall. The number of people built is about one thousand. As long as the brick and cement can guarantee the supply, it should be possible to complete the established task of moving all the eastbound fugitives into the town before the demon moon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; Since Karl often reports to Roland about the current situation of the project, this statement is very simple, such as the expansion of the castle area and the construction of the witch building, he did not mention. In addition, after the new city wall has been positioned, the line is completely constructed by the lotus, and the daily progress is kept at about 100 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Working hard," Roland nodded. The engineering department, whether it was personnel or funding, was the largest department, so the results were the most. Don't forget to promote the preferential policies of Bianbu Town. These handymen from the fortress can also be regarded as a qualified craftsman after a year of practice. You should leave them in the town as much as possible."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Highness." Carl answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next one...the iron axe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axe is still participating for the first time Such a meeting seems to be somewhat inadequate. He cleared his throat. "His Highness, the army is mainly two things. First, the Second Army has completed basic training and can be sent to the fortress at any time. Secondly, with the addition of new blood, the First Army has 832. Fifteen people, leaving the artillery team of three hundred and fifty people, the rest of the soldiers have all replaced the runner rifle. I want to say this." After the report, he performed a military ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, let the Second Army start tomorrow, remember that there must be reliable personnel in the team, and the daily training and thought cultivation should not be interrupted in the fortress. Report the situation to the town every week," Roland pointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
