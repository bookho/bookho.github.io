			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Company..." Roland whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Victor glimpsed, "If you have doubts about where, I can explain it again--"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," he waved. "This is really an interesting plan. At least it seems to be fine. How long will it take to get the funds in place?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor’s eyes suddenly brightened, “I know you can understand it – please be rude, kneel, if you are also a businessman, Achievements will never be under any big business association!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This metaphor seems to lower the identity of the king, but puts the other person in his own industry The top is a highly recognized way of expressing aristocratic etiquette, and it can be regarded as an undisguised flattery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment Roland’s heart is completely another idea: Isn’t this the next big industrial company? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With technology, spontaneous recruitment, organization of production and marketing, self-interest and loss... He did not expect to hear such a complete concept in a contemporary population . The biggest difference with the Chamber of Commerce is that the plan combines production and sales, which can be said to be the prototype of modern private enterprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be an excellent opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past four years, his territory has gained considerable development, but it has gradually revealed the inadequacies - that is, the Executive Office has almost completed all. Any project requires an administrative department to control, from the number of people to the budget, these complicated work regulations take up most of the officials. As the scale of the project continues to expand, it will inevitably lead to more bloated institutions and lower administrative efficiency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be regarded as a common problem of "state-owned enterprises" - profit and loss once it has nothing to do with the participants, stability becomes everything. It has the advantage of not being rewarded and determined by the upper will. It can quickly meet the demand in the early stage, and can also be used to overcome the risky strategic projects in the later stage, but it does not mean that it can do anything. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also one of the reasons why Roland has made great efforts to develop heavy industry and agriculture without the winter city, but the light industry has rarely taken into account - in addition to the limited labor force, the Executive Office has taken There are not so many officials to deal with the expansion of the industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the order is simple, but it’s a one-word thing, but it’s really going to be implemented. Even if you build a steam engine assembly plant, you need a whole set of hands. stand by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, he has a new choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The means of attracting investment has not yet been made, and some people took the initiative to send him in front of him. Roland naturally did not easily refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this "company" has the background of a foreign family, it will inevitably cause a certain golden dragon outflow after the profit, but as long as its production department is in the gray fort, This is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reaching the initial intention, Roland personally sent Victor to the gate of the castle. "When you are ready, I think the new cotton seeds should also be cultivated. However, one thing I have to explain in advance is that if there are other businessmen who intend to follow suit in the future, the Executive Office will sell the seeds to them at the same price. The richer the products on the market, the more affordable the price will be. You should be clearer than I am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, Your Majesty," Victor showed a confident look in his eyes. "Dawn merchants never fear competition. My The father always said that from the moment we were born, the competition has already begun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was about to retire, Roland suddenly stopped him again. "Right, I still want to ask you a question. My Minister found that you had a record of paying taxes to the Long Song Fortress six years ago. Why? If you want to save this amount at that time, it is for you. Should it be a breeze?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;Victor nodded. "But the lord at the time promised that as long as he paid the tax in a quantity, he would provide some convenience and protection for the caravans between Bentham and the long song. He did. - At that time, this cost would at least save the threat of beasts and the attacks of peers. I always felt that it was a good thing for businessmen to pay a little price to get a stable and orderly rule. Regrettably, many people prefer to invest large sums of money on unworthy goods and are not willing to treat the rules as one of the costs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
