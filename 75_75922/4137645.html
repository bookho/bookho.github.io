			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the whirlpool Haidong domain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large fleet of ships lined up in a five-way column, floating outside the shadow islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most striking vessel is the Snowwind, whether it’s a black steel hull or a black smoke from the top of the head. The other sea boats are distinctly separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the deck of the Snowwind is busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors are rushing back and forth to make final preparations for entering the archipelago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder is telling the attention of the people in the bridge. "You are the best explorers in the fjord. Many people are not the first time to come. I don’t have much to say about nonsense. The position of this island is erratic, and when it falls, it will raise fog. So you can’t take it lightly at any time, understand?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you can rest assured," an adjutant patted his chest. "We have been with you for so many years. When did you make a mistake? The four major chambers of commerce have to send a big ship." Followed by, the problem is also out of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, there are a few boats, and I want to walk through the waters of the reefs." Sancha sea-going vessels are not a good choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They probably thought that their boats were as flexible as the Snowwinds, so don’t expect them when they hit the rocks. Let's go back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This caused a burst of laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Worried that we hide the discovery, it is not enough to let the captain ride our windboat directly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Those Chambers of Commerce clearly want to take a bigger say in this expedition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that their funding is not good. Take."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you want to go further east, there is no big-scale fleet, but there is no way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the noisy crowd, Camilla Darry sighed slightly. In the nearly one month of sailing, she also had a basic understanding of the shadow sea. It seems to be the center of the whirlpool. Every time the tide rises and falls, it starts from here, and it is also the most obvious sea area. The difference between the front and the back can even make thousands of reefs under the water into an archipelago. The sleeping island is nothing more than a small witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what’s even more incredible is that the Shadow Islands have been discovered for more than a decade, but there is never a precise chart. The reason is here. The reefs are not fixed - all objects hidden under water seem to be constantly moving, and even the huge remains are no exception. To cross the sea, you must wait until all the rocks are out of the water. Because of this, the difficulty of sailing in it can be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this group of people is totally different from a well-trained professional. It is more like a band of gangsters. The identity of the explorer does have a good reputation in front of the fjord. However, she can't see this completely between her peers. Except for a few people who can serve the public like the Thunder, most of them are the masters of their own way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Camilla, who was once a nobleman, the nature of such a chaotic scene made her feel resentful. If it wasn’t for the request of His Highness, she really didn’t want Joan. Act with this group of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to sighing, she found that she actually missed the first army without the winter city - at least they would not be like monkeys when performing tasks. It’s always pleasing to see the queues that stand up at all times and are full of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resist the discomfort of the heart, Camilla left the bridge command room and came to the back deck of the steel ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw Joan playing at the stern and Ms. Margaret with her at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing her appear, Joan’s contracted behind the businesswoman, only half a head to look at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businesswoman smiled. "What's wrong? Is it in a bad mood?" She pointed to her mouth. "It's all on the face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, "Carmela groaned, "I am just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you not like the atmosphere in the command room?" Margaret saw her. The idea, "I have already said it, what to explore for the men to worry about, you concentrate on the scenery of the sea, just like a trip."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you do that," Camilla frowned. "If anything is out of the way, isn't it equal to putting your life in their hands?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you not trust the Thunder?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Margaret pulled her hand and walked to the fence. "Your sense of responsibility is worthy of admiration. I don't think so. Tilly will not give you the island to manage. But sometimes, trust more people occasionally. Not bad - not just mine And Tilly is also the same..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I not trust my Highness Terry? - Kamilla thought so, but found it impossible. Will rebut the export. She has always disagreed with the move of the witch to the absence of the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's more, staying in the sea is long, and it's easy to drive yourself crazy at all times," Margaret continued. "Don't look at them." Like a bunch of uncultivated bandits, there is still a lot of nautical skills."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camilla finally found a place to open, "I have to declare I didn't say that..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you think so, right?" The words of the businesswoman quickly made her speechless. Hahaha, this is nothing unusual. The nobles of the four kingdoms look at us like barbarians, just like us to see the Mojinsha people like barbarians. To be honest, there is no discrimination at all, or the reason for discrimination is not related to the origin of the nobility, I I have only seen one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland. Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she does not want to admit it, she can only think of this name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the person publicly extended a helping hand to the witch four years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think that he might have hidden the wrong heart, now this excuse has ceased to exist, because the rescued witch has become gray The queen of the fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More... Trust? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the occasion of Cameron’s silence, there was a faint muffled sound in the distance from the sea, like a huge wave swept towards them, like It is countless fish swarming in the sea - but she knows that it is just her own illusion. At this moment, the sea is still calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Began to ebb." Margaret whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"吖...吖..." Joan grabbed the businesswoman’s clothes tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, Kamila saw the change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pointed stone reveals the sea...and then the second, the third...not so much the archipelago, it’s better to say that it’s a stone forest. Appropriate, they are rising from the water, and in a short time they occupy a large area of ​​water. When the water surface fell more than five meters, the thicker island reef under the stone pillar gradually revealed the true body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camilla couldn’t help but hold his breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was the first time she saw such an incredible scene - because the entire sea area was falling, so that the sea antenna at the end of the horizon "floated", as if Rise to the islands. But that's just the error caused by vision. The exact saying should be "slope": the original sea antenna became the top of the slope, and the shadow sea area became a slightly inclined gentle slope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even if the sea still can't see the waves, blocking the ears and looking back, you can still describe it with calm waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
