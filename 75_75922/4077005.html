			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the popular school car fever in college, he also rushed to sign up with his classmates at the time. I didn’t expect to touch the steering wheel for the first time after leaving the driving school. In the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, what is that monster?" Farr asked weakly, "Can the demon have such a powerful power? In a short period of time, it has been greatly improved. This is theoretically impossible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she avoided the first magic shock, she and Yan were most affected. Even a beautiful violet-colored curly hair is missing half. Fortunately, every wound is not fatal, basically avoiding the head and torso. In other words, when faced with the messy magic like a blade, she chose the most appropriate dodge method - one in ability and Witches that are not entirely of the type of combat can also behave like this. It must be said that all Tacchi survivors are experienced fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to this, the first pioneering action did not end in failure. Although I don't know what it would be like to die in a dream, Roland hopes that there will never be a day to verify this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Has the Federation never seen a similar ability?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course...so-called The counter-attack is caused by the loss of the magic to the body," Farr gasped. "If a witch increases her magical capacity through constant practice, the body will adapt to this damage and will not recover." There are too many drops. Whether we, the devil, or the mixed kind of evil beasts, we can only slowly improve our magic level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original, Roland I think that for the first time, she saw a living life consisting purely of magic, or that her life in consciousness should be flesh and bone, so when she encounters such an enemy that she has never seen before, she naturally feels Unable to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He himself has no such doubts, he has already regarded the other person as a spirit or element when he plays the monster to expose the translucent body like jelly. The creature itself is constructed by magic, and naturally it will not be hurt by the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this kind of problem is not well explained, and the guess is not necessarily correct, especially when the blue light in it has the upper hand, the obvious decline of emotion and mind Whether or not you can attribute it to life is still to be said. Roland finally shook his head. "I don't know what it is, but one thing is certain, it is definitely not a demon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dream World Are there many such monsters in the middle?" The thinnest spirit still seems to have a lingering fear. "When the shadow in the room is covered by the black and red emptiness, I feel that the whole body is frozen. It seems that there is something extremely The terrible things are watching me - I swear, even when faced with high-level devils are not so terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think certainly not too More, otherwise the dream world should have been occupied by them," Roland comforted. Erosers will not be hurt by ordinary force, they can only be handed over to the martial arts associations, but in the face of such monsters, I am afraid that dozens of martial arts will not necessarily win together. If there are more, the association will It’s over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in retrospect, he can already be sure that the "outside erosion" that Garcia said is inseparable from the red moon, the tentacles that are out of nothing, simply It is exactly the same as the scene seen in the domain of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the Red Moon eroding dreams? This world should not be part of the Red Moon... Who is the owner of the monster mouth, is it the body of the gods or the source of the magic? If it really excludes the dream world, why is it still silent when he connects with the relics of the gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other monsters’ last mention of "the bottomless world" also made Roland extravagant, probably because of the language assimilation. The structure of this word is quite different from the light. Some are consistent - this suffix appears only when it refers to the entire continent, just as the meaning of the gods is similar, but the expression used is another way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Red Moon has been watching the real world for the sake of the war of divineity, will it reveal the same content as it understands? Refers to a continent in reality? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These questions can only be left to the explorer to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to learn to drive?" Roland left the distracting thoughts in his heart and asked her with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice nodded immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we have to do a few more votes," he took the opportunity to seduce. "At that time, not only can you enjoy different foods every day, independent bedrooms." And the private car is not a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there something better than Kaifeng cuisine and hot pot?" Farr interjected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just an entry level, and if you have money, you will find that even if you eat every day, you can’t taste all the delicacies in the world. Last time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even without looking back, Roland can feel the burning gaze of several witches behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you are hurt, go to the next one. I have already marked its position." Farr’s voice is still not strong, weak. The meaning was a lot less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't care, I can start tomorrow after I finish my magic," the little man is more active. "This injury doesn't get in the way."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always some fearful spirits that have been touched by this temptation. Although they are not attached to everyone, the eyes reflected in the rearview mirror are shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can’t help but feel very emotional. It’s such a simple matter to improve morale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent the police from coming to the door, he did not drive the car directly into the package. The street, but parked next to the construction site of the Sanye Group next door, the area is still in the process of demolition, basically a monitoring blind spot, you can easily return to the leased warehouse around the path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that is the moment to check the spoils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is not much cash stored in the safe, only about 100,000 in total, there are quite a lot of jewelry, the result is not jade or jewelry. How much money can be worth a fixed amount. Unexpectedly, he also turned out a lot of solidified natural forces, precisely because it was stuffed with these small, but extraordinarily heavy things, which gave him the illusion that the trip was fruitful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotions Now these guys are not popular with banknote transactions, using the power of nature as the equivalent currency? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Roland returned to 0827, it was already at 11:30 in the evening, he opened the door lightly, but found the lights in the living room still lit. Jie Luo was kneeling on the side of the coffee table, and the curved back was slightly up and down, as if he had entered a dream. The little girl was still in front of a stack of books and a pencil case. Obviously she was reviewing her homework while waiting for him to come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are just the relationship between the tenant and the landlord, but now they have a feeling of a family. Looking at this scene, Roland’s heart is inevitably soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped forward and gently picked up the cleansing, put her back on the bedroom bed, took off her shoes and covered the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there are textbooks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she forgot to bring her class tomorrow, she must blame herself again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland smiled and shook his head, and took a few books from the coffee table and folded them on the desk of Jieluo. Just then, the boldface on the cover of the textbook caught his attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Junior High School". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a seemingly tall, but not practical, surgical subject. He remembers that he was not very interested in mathematics when he was in junior high school. I think that Olympiad is an upgraded version of mathematics. It is even more respectful. I would rather study sketches and calligraphy during the summer vacation than to participate in the Olympiad classes held in the school. Therefore, it is impossible to know what the class is talking about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he just saw that the textbook is not blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland felt the breath suddenly rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
