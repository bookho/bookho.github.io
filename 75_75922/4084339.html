Occasionally, he will bicker with another brand friend, but in general he gets along very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These messages made him almost forget the passage of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown, there was an uncoordinated quarrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" Hill stopped telling, and quickly walked over to the door and glanced across the door. "The first floor seems to be out "The situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked," Otto gestured to him to sit down and then shouted outside the door. "Who is noisy below, go see What happened!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, adults," the maid who kept the door replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe someone is drinking too much," he gathered over his blanket. "This kind of thing is not common, but as long as it is a pub, it is always inevitable." I will meet. You said that Miss Quinn participated in the Wintertown Hunting Competition. What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill didn't answer, just made a 噤A gesture of sound, gently leaning your head against the door panel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the count, his expression suddenly sank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The following people are not only wearing armor, but also holding weapons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Otto groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard the sound of iron boots and hilts colliding with the floor, tables and chairs. Will anyone wear a full set of arms while drinking?" Hill did not Waiting for the maid's return, but to open the soft collapse, "the alcoholic can not play the knight's preferences, trouble came to the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This... ...how is it possible?" Otto frowned. "Please believe me, I absolutely don't--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, if I don't trust you, I won't come. I am looking for you here," Hill interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... we will meet again in the next time, let's go first. If they are really looking for you, I will help you block it." He was very sorry in his heart. After this time, I don’t know when I will hear Andrea’s news again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't go with me?" The other person was a little surprised. "The guys are not good at it, you should return to the territory first."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, I am the eldest son of Losey's family, they can still do it to me," Otto shook his head, not to mention the rescue of the witch, secretly contact Roland's agent. They all look at their fathers. If the troublemakers are really coming to the ambassadors, isn’t it a special embarrassment? Even if there is no problem, it becomes a problem. "And although this secret road is unknown, it is not difficult to search. If you see that there is no one in the house, they will inevitably be suspicious. If I stay here, you can evacuate more safely."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, good luck, good luck." Hill didn't keep going, he let go of his hands and slipped into the secret passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto to arrange the pad and bedding for him, re-lying on the soft collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short while, the footsteps came from the stairs, accompanied by the sound of metal friction, and the maid who had inquired about the situation never appeared again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was neither knocking nor questioning, the door panel was directly knocked open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of heavily armed knights squeezed into the single room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean by this!" Otto said with anger. "This place is the site of the Count of Losey. Do you want to rebel?" He is planning to support Get up and drive the rude people out of the pub. I didn't expect the other party to rush and put him to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
