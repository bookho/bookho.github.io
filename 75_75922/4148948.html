			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fishballs noticed changes in the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has always been fighting with a mentality of smashing the opposite in front of him, but the pressure caused by the other party is lower than he expected. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When fighting in the fertile plains and the devil, the pressure on the battlefield almost made it difficult for him to breathe. There was only one thought in his head, and it was as stiff as a stone. But now, he still has the strength to observe the situation of his teammates and attackers, and to think about the actions that the other party is likely to take. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy's movements have been slowed down as the charge has been forced back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most obvious point is that the gap between the first army’s shots has been greatly lengthened – in order to save ammunition, they usually only intensively when the aristocracy launched a charge. Fired, but the last shot was basically an hour ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of subsequent ensuing reinforcements, this kind of "stagnation" that neither advances nor retreats is absolutely taboo. Then again, the first army is in a semi-slope position, and there is a cover for the sandstone camp. The advantage of shooting is far greater than the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t quite understand why the aristocratic commander makes this choice – unlike cold weapons, no contact does not mean no fighting, those attackers Every moment is suffering from the pressure of being shot, this is undoubtedly a blow to morale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the front lines do not go backwards is proof that the fish balls have seen with their own eyes that some people’s crouching position has returned to nearly 100 points than the initial position. M, now the entire front line has been as uneven as a twisty wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also reveals that the attacker is not a complete force, but is made up of several teams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the fish balls are also aware that the enemy may not be so good at the way the firearms fight, although there are obvious traces of the first army, but Did not play the role of the weapon in hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise they will not be able to stick to the present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it sounds incredible, no one has been killed in the squad until now, and only five people were injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can’t be explained by luck alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who can give me some bullets, my flash is gone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Also, there is only one last clip in hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Squad leader, what should I do next?" Hansen bent back and asked, "The machine gun has been There are no living enemies, or do we drag and retreat after the night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish pill looked up at the sky, at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, late autumn The sun sets faster, and it will be dark in an hour and a half. By then the threat of enemy firearms will be greatly reduced, even if it is directed against direct firepower, there is no chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But perhaps because of the escaping too much before, he always thinks more about retreating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night has weakened the bonfire's head, and the First Army will also lose the most reliance. More critically, if the enemy rekindles morale because of this move, and they follow them, can they beat each other again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if the ammunition is sufficient, the team may be able to complete the evacuation before the attacker reacts. However, according to the current situation, the nobility should soon notice that the frequency of shooting in the camp is no longer the same, so it is not difficult to guess their next move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than two of the five injured were heavier, and the withdrawal of the injured teammate would inevitably slow down further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandoning the teammates, the fish ball can’t be asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hesitated again and again, and finally made up his mind, "Call everyone else, I have something to say."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy did not seem to find that the first army's shooting points were concentrated. They still crouched on the grass, and occasionally they used guns to make such a hair, which strengthened the belief of the fish balls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told the situation briefly, and then looked around the crowd, "Your Majesty often said that the offense is always the best defense, if we can defeat these nobles in one fell swoop, Then there is no worries about staying in the country. If it is the other way around, it may leave the enemy with a chance to take a bite. Now is the time to make a decision. We can give the enemy to the enemy, or we can I will control myself. I want to hear now, what is your thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Squad leader, do you mean... let us take the initiative?" Hansen couldn't help but see, "The number of opponents can be much more than ours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already considered them, they seem to be superior, but Most of them have long been unintentional. Just a long-range shot can't make the enemy intuitively aware of the defeat. If we can kill their most tough team, maybe we can completely destroy each other's fighting will!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our bullets are not much ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The First Army is not an army that can only fight with guns. This is emphasized in the Operation Manual." . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone was silent for a while, Hansen opened his mouth first, "I listen to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes, squad leader, I don't want to leave anyone alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Either go, or stay."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Order, squad leader!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish pill solemnly nodded, if it was before, he would never have thought that he would make such a decision. After four years in the army, he felt that he really had something changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not a coward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pleasing sound reappears to the ear . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and said word by word, "Everyone, the bayonet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp From the oldest rifle to the rifle, the structure of the gun has changed a lot, but the bayonet has not been canceled. It is different, that is, it is better than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers brushed the knife from the scabbard and inserted it into the cassette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish pill inserts the last bullet into the gun, and shouts his arm, "Come with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the lead in turning out the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other teammates followed, rushing toward the nearest enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the opponent apparently hasn’t reacted to what happened. Many of them didn’t even get up from the ground in the first place, but continued to use it in inertia. The lame posture shot toward the first army that rushed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fish ball has been prepared for the shot, but the expected stinging has not been able to come, and the distance of more than 100 meters is instantaneous. At this time, the enemy dreamed of standing up like a wake-up, standing on the spot with a bare rifle, as if I didn't know how to be good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He broke the bayonet into the chest of the first enemy according to the posture during training-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Kill!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teammates also swarmed and rushed into the crowd with the momentum of going down the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling the killing sound suddenly broke through the hillside! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fish ball stabbed one, shot and killed one, then turned and stabbed the third, and found that there was no new target around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
