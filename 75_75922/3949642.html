			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the agreed date of the founding of the city, Roland got up very early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scratch the cheeks of the cheeks, gather the long gray hair behind the brain, tie it into a simple hair bundle, and finally trim the eyebrows with a small scissors. ——After one year of life, he has been able to complete these care tasks very skillfully, without the help of a maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the slightly blurred silver mirror, the mirror itself is quite a bit sensational, if you wear a loose robes, match It is not an exaggeration to dress up in this city and say that it is a practitioner who hides in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded with satisfaction and got up and went to the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Barov had already waited in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness," he said. "The flight messenger to the Long Song Fortress has been released. It is expected that you will arrive at Fortress Castle in half an hour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, how is the site layout done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was completed yesterday afternoon, currently Look at all the population that is large enough to accommodate the town," the general manager said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job," Roland praised, walking slowly to the floor-to-ceiling window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desperate mountains and secluded forests in the distance are still white, and the morning light shines on the snow, reflecting the golden light. On the streets of some small towns, you can already see the figures of the activities. They gather in the west and go to the Maoshi City Wall area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the defensive line against the evil spirits attack last year, this stone wall that relies on the rapid construction of cement can be said to have contributed, but now it has become The dividing line of the inner and outer towns of the town. Roland does not like this symbolic division of the rich and the poor, so it is sooner or later to dismantle it in addition to the commemorative gap section and the tower area. But before that, you can take advantage of it - the number of people in front of the wall can be far more than the square, so Roland set the location of the city declaration in the middle of the stone wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the plan, in order to strengthen the impact of the construction of the city on the residents of the two places, the long song fortress will also announce the establishment of the city at the same time, the synchronization of the two places is realized by the flight messenger When the first messenger flew into the hands of Pei Luo, it was also the time when Roland made his speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this ash that carries the message should be flying between the mountains and the Chishui River, as usual, tied to the claws. The note was passed to the two places, and Roland thought, but it didn't know what news it carried and what it meant. From the moment it landed, Bianbu Town and Changge Fortress would all be together... Become history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go," he gathered his thoughts and turned his head back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Highness." Barov smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer Hermon step by step onto the erected wooden platform, look around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many people in the square, at least far less than the sight of a porridge a week ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not surprising that people care less about things other than eating and drinking. Compared to the freely distributed porridge, the ceremony of building a city ceremony sounds like Ordinary people don't have much contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even his own, he felt that his Highness was a bit more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the evil month, the number of urban residents applying for work to the City Hall is less than what they imagined. The notice for recruiting the handyman and the repairman is posted for a week. It’s still less than half of the plan. The mice seem to have signs of resurgence, and at least the police department has received more reports, and it is a headache for them to check whether they are true or false. Good friend Rennes Meade complained to him that the arrest team had to double their manpower to get over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in line with Pero’s expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people are like this, lazy, greedy, and ignorant... How much reward does His Royal Highness spend on them? What is most puzzling is that Roland Wimbledon is clearly a royal aristocrat. Where does the confidence in the people’s inexplicable come from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
