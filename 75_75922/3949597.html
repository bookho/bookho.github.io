			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto finally saw the legendary Grey Fort Four Prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that he was indeed a morning aristocrat, he was brought into the castle by Carter, and then the attendant came to wash toiletries, new clothes and hot food, at the same time Carter also searched him all over the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the most rude reception method that Otto has ever seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Four Princes stayed in the north facing room on the third floor of the castle. When you opened the door, the first thing that caught your eye was a half of the wall. The floor-to-ceiling windows, the snow behind it, set the room very bright, clearly without lit the fireplace, but the room was extraordinarily warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince sat in front of a red wooden table and looked at the black book in his hand - Otto found out that it was his own notebook. In addition, the ambassador’s official and family seals were placed aside, and it seems that the hotel where they lived has been thoroughly searched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hair color is similar to that of Feike, and the face can be seen with a little similarity, but the feeling is quite different. Whether it is sitting or looking, he seems very casual, and this rumor is that the four princes like to go their own way is quite right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw himself, he closed the book and smiled. "You are the messenger from the morning kingdom? Please sit down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto is in accordance with the nobility etiquette, regardless of how bad the other party is doing, he has to follow this set - after all, the four princes may not care much as a joke, but He represents the face of the morning king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What you wrote, I looked a little," the prince laughed. "Some aspects of the record are really detailed, and it is not surprising that people are misunderstood." And my people don't know where you are from, they are also eager to report because of my orders. I apologize to you here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Report? Otto's brows are slightly wrinkled, but no amount of explanation can be excused for the rude violation of a nobleman, not to mention the other person is a man without a prince. If he is not responsible, he will ask His Royal Highness to bring this abducted aristocrat to justice. He pressed his heart to the unhappiness. "No, Your Highness, you are doing this for the sake of the stability of the territory. It’s just... this may hurt those innocent outsiders. Most people may not be able to prove themselves like me. "Identity of the instrument."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to worry about this, the Ministry of Justice's forensics is not related to identity documents, we have a series of measures to ensure the innocence of innocent people," The prince waved his hand. "How do you say it, we don't want a good person, and we don't let go of a bad person." He said that he raised his mouth here. "I heard about the process of your arrest, if they follow their request. You don't actually get any harm. The process is a bit rude and helpless. You must know that some vicious and wicked people may fight for weapons at any time and attempt to fight back. Since the winter, two policemen in Bianbu Town have been injured when they arrested." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police... probably referring to those patrols. What is the Ministry of Justice and the organization that manages the patrol? He suppressed the doubts in his heart. "Does such things happen often?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is always one or two in a month," said the prince, his hand, "probably It was in this endless winter that Tiefko was also flustered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hide his hostility towards the new king, Otto realized that The contradictions on both sides are obviously irreconcilable. He hesitated for a moment. "When I passed the kingdom, I heard some folk rumors... Are you really planning to push Tefko down the throne?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the rumor say that the throne of the new king is in jeopardy?" The other party said bluntly, "Tefico should not be tempted to win the throne. In order to gain authority, he murdered his father and framed his brother. The third sister was also driven out of the gray fort; the entire south was destroyed by war and the people were displaced. This is a crime he committed. Only by overthrowing it can the gray castle restore its former prosperity."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto’s slight glimpse, Roland Wimbledon’s reaction is even worse than the new king, at least In the determination to fight, Tefco is far less active... The status and momentum of the two seem to be reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cleared his throat before he took the other person’s words. "In this case, the Morning Dawn Kingdom is a friendly neighbor, and hopes that the Grey Fort can be restored to stability as soon as possible. Come, it is the covenant of the Lord of the Morning, the death of Diogen Moya."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
