			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many of these people? What is the purpose of coming here? Are they all awakened by the power of nature? What will another world look like? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finishing the cold is completely unknown now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for now, they are at least not enemies - Roland’s victory over the demon is real, and he is indeed fighting for erosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last joint annihilation action proved that she would never forget the sentence she had heard before the coma. What is "Your Majesty, everyone is knocked out by me?" After that, Roland repeatedly deliberately avoided her gaze. What is the difference between this and no silver? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, if the other person really has some unforgettable mourning, she can’t live to the present – ​​after destroying the magical creatures of erosion, hunting The murderer has a chance to solve the problem of hearing this sentence together. As long as it is pushed to the enemy afterwards, no one will doubt it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in Fiji’s cold, this is obviously kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides no tangible evidence, the goodwill of the other party is also the reason why she did not immediately report the speculation to the top of the association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland or Wakiris, they all chose to hide their true origins. Although it is not clear what the reason is, but since they hope so, it is better to let this "tacit understanding" continue for a while, and she will observe it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes, I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finishing language hangs up, Wakiri nodded. "Mr. Rock has something to look for. I can't accompany you any more today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, it matters."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So see you tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." Just as she walked to the door, Kiris stopped her again. "Captain, can you bring me some books about technology development tomorrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are referring to the encyclopedia What kind of things?" Fiji thought coldly. "It should be no problem. But there are so many categories in this book. I don't know if I can find what you want to see."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, whichever kind of thing," the other party said with joy, "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a little effort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the door was closed, Fiji’s cold returned to normal time. Expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, she is not a pure history fan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is trying to understand this new world as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris looked at the covered door and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It knows that it’s too irritating, but now there is no better choice - this man named Fiji is the only one who can understand The channel of outside information, if anything is coming slowly, I am afraid that this month will be wasted in the hospital bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Hecksod’s plan goes well, the West Line Army should have extended its front line to human territory. This is the moment when people are needed. Its "missing" will surely make the Lord of Scorpio violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Wajilis’s mood is quite contradictory at this time. On the one hand, he hopes that Hecksod will desperately wake it up from Dianchi Lake. Even if that would lose most of the memory gained in the conscious world, it might even cause irreversible damage to the mind, but on the other hand it would not give up the clues that it currently has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the former is very simple. The more you look for it, the more uneasy your heart feels. The more you forget it, the easier it will be. No matter what kind of secret Roland has, as long as the inheritance fragments are taken in the real world, human beings can no longer afford any water. Even the things they have are all classified as belongings in the form of inheritance, and this secret is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the above are all reasons for the bright side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has an idea that cannot be said or even reluctant to admit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is during this time, it seems to have returned to the days of studying in the Yunxiao School, not only can you access new knowledge every day, but also let people watch Going to a future that is completely different from reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris took out a box of sealed pastries from the bag at the top of the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a beautifully printed pattern, the appearance is exactly the same as those of human food, different colors represent different tastes, and you can smell it when you open the seal. A tempting taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a delicious taste that it has never imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeding is a low-level performance in the ethnic group. Only the hybrids and the protozoa need to eat with their mouths. Ordinary blood food can only provide very little energy, and It's very difficult to digest, so the most common practice is to put the food in a dense place and soften it before eating it. This process is like human baking, but they use fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the things that have been dealt with at this point are at best filled with stomach. Since becoming a promoter and able to draw supplies directly from life, Wakiri Silk has never eaten food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some ethnic groups who have extended their diet to other races...such as humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, even a witch is inseparable from three meals a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It once thought so, until now that the food produced on the Kajid Peninsula could have been eaten to this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris puts a piece of pastry in his mouth and feels the thorny sweetness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that these foods still retain a simple, air-drying flavor, an innovation based on ethnic characteristics and human technology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It quickly eats the pastry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Yunxiao School is still there, if the "Thousand Shapes" are still... Can they also create such a great food? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightmare shook his head and left this distracting thought behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what, the battle of the gods has been brewing for hundreds of years, and it has already been unstoppable like a flood. The situation today is not one that can be controlled by one person, and the continuation of the ethnic group is guaranteed. Its most important goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the problem returned to the first point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It knows where the uneasiness in your heart comes from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this month of exploration, Wakiris has basically confirmed that in reality, the shocking changes of mankind are inseparable from the relationship here, in which Roland is the cause The culprit of all the changes. The firearms mentioned many times in the history book are almost identical to the descriptions in the Ursuk report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last piece of the puzzle in my mind has emerged, it does find the source of human advancement - although I don’t know why the human male can gain access to the conscious world. But the status quo is like this. He learned from this vast field of consciousness that he was far beyond the knowledge of the age, and then applied it to the ethnic group. The witch became a bridge to transform knowledge, instead of being consumed in the flesh and blood battlefield as in the past. They are not facing the federation four hundred years ago, but a new human community. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that's the only way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning through history books, it also detected an amazing fact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is when the human civilization is promoted to a certain degree, the speed of development will suddenly rise several times! For example, thousands of years ago they were still using guns to kill each other, but now they have spread their footprints in the sky and the ocean, and the weapons have evolved to the point of destroying the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the biggest uneasiness of Wakiris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
