			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's so weird," Wajilis said coldly. "Do you think anyone can have the ability to enter the depths of consciousness? Or... Are you actually proud to have imprisoned a Maharaja?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, even in an absolutely unfavorable situation, the other party has not abandoned his pride, Roland even has a species Premonition, if he is too bullying, the other party may directly greet the witch and rush to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this reply really surprised him - asking the title is just a casual mention, after all, the high-end devils mostly have their own unique title, and can The promotion of the ceremony in the City of the Devil is not necessarily a nameless generation. Only he did not expect that the origin of this devil is more complicated than he imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland originally thought that Wakiris was a chance to escape from the memory fragments, but now there is one more possibility: the other party may come from the real world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of the nightmare originally appeared in the instrument of Erskuk, saying hello to it proves that it is not a historical figure, but is still active in the top of the devil. In addition, the piece of memory was repeatedly watched by Roland several times. During this period, I did not hear the name that corresponds to the Maharaja. If the devil language learned from Kabrada is correct, it means the time. The moderator has not been promoted to Maharaja. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with its own "active in-depth understanding of the world", and the analysis of the situation of the frontline of the North Pearl, Roland has become more inclined to the latter answer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, sitting on the opposite side of Vakiris is at least a long history of 800 years, and the strength and insight are rare among the devils. presence. If you count the obvious reaction to the cockroach, this time can be pushed farther! The value of such a conversation is far greater than a soul re-enacted from the memory fragments, even if it does not say anything, it is equivalent to erasing a majestic devil for the front line, this is already significant. Now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to correct your statement. First of all, I have not imprisoned you. At least for now, you are free." Roland replied with a calm look, " Secondly, breaking into the world of dreams is your subjective behavior. I don't think there is something wrong with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Wajilis’s words, After a long time, I was sullen and vomiting. "Do you call this a dream world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pride makes it unbearable, but it also makes it impossible to do it. There is a clear and unreasonable argument - this silence has confirmed the origins of the nightmare: it really came to this place through the conscious community. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because every time I fall asleep, I will enter here, in a sense, it is no different from dreaming."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's ridiculous!" Wajilis lowered his voice. In the field of pioneering consciousness, this kind of thing not only requires talent, but also requires a highly concentrated spirit and a steel-like will, so that it will not be lost in the magic sea. As a result, this unmagic male can do as long as he sleeps and sleeps. It’s too unfair! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, this is something you ordered, please enjoy it slowly." At this time the waiter brought the meal up, a variety of pastries and The drink quickly filled a table and looked quite delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the truth." After the waiter left, Roland said, "As I said before, frankness is good for each other, I Don't lie to you on this kind of thing. Not to mention the above is not the focus, the focus is on the truth of the battle of God... and the future of the respective ethnic groups." He picked up the chopsticks and made a gesture of asking, "We can eat these Talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris reconfirmed that this male is different from all the humans he has ever seen before. This involves ethnic continuity. The big things have a reason to talk while eating. If you change to other normal people, I am afraid that it will be serious and serious. But he is not like deliberately teasing himself, as if for him, doing this is a normal thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took the cup of turbid peninsula coffee and took a sip on his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scent of softness and smoothness slid across the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually... it’s really good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
