			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second month of summer, the midsummer day, Margaret is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the vessels brought by the business group far exceeded the upper limit of the dock. Many sailboats can only dock at the river, waiting for the unloading of the former ship. The bridge can only be connected after completion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Roland realize that the town terminal had to be expanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fortune Industrial Company finally successfully completed the task this month, reducing the scrap rate of parts to 40%, and successfully produced three steam engines before the delivery date. . Although compared with the third-generation steam engine currently in use in the town, the foreign trade products produced by the factory are in a big gap in terms of power, air leakage, noise, vibration, etc., but compared with the first machine, it is already a long-term progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crescent Moon Bay Caravan has brought a team of 300 craftsmen by contract, and Roland has placed them all in the industrial park on the south bank of the Chishui River - except In addition to a new wooden factory building next to the original factory, he also ordered Carl to build a staff dormitory in the park near the river bank. In order to complete the facility within one month, huge logs were transported to the site, and Carl was in charge of technical guidance, and Anna cut it. The longest time-consuming wood processing session took only two days to complete, and Carl, the former teacher of Anna, was stunned by her new ability. In just six months, the emaciated girl has Become confident and full of spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland held a sumptuous dinner at the castle to welcome the arrival of businessmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, liquor also appeared in the eyes of everyone for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every time you come here, there will be new things, Margaree really didn't lie to me," Hogg said. "Even the wines are so different." Compared to this...this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Liquor," Margaret reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, white wine! Compared to it, ale and wine are simply boring," he snorted and drank the wine from the glass. "His Highness, you must sell me a few boxes of this thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it tastes too hot, or fruit wine is more suitable for me," The businessman smiled and shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland smiled. "It’s related to taste. Not everyone can accept high concentrations of distilled spirits. I have no plans to promote it. It’s just a coincidence. Made some, and tasted it for everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the era of brewing wine or the mainstream, distilled liquor is clearly a new star with great development potential, like the afterlife. Liquor, rum, whiskey and vodka are all high-alcoholic distilled spirits, and on top of these distilled spirits, a series of bartending cultures have been extended. However, for the current border town, it is still too early to develop this industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, the last time you wrote to tell me something, I have sent people to collect a lot of news," Margaret said. "Yong Dong was After the church was controlled, there was not much change. The resistance of the wolf kingdom was much stronger. It was said that the church army was all gathered in the Broken Fort, and it could not go further for more than two months. In addition, the morning king sent a messenger to the Grey Fort. I believe that the church’s move is not to destroy the witch, but to occupy the mainland. He called on the two countries to form alliances, expel the church and fight against the holy city of Hermes.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did the king respond?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The former Prime Minister, Marquis Wick, rejected the proposal and also rebuked the other party for being nonsense." Garmore shrugged. "This incident is aroused by the king." Even the aristocracy did not reach an agreement. As far as I know, many people support the alliance. After all, the church has no sign of returning the rule to the eternal winter successor."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tifferko did not come forward?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Prime Minister’s answer must have been from the inspiration of Tiffco, who With the army rushed to the east," Marlan looked a little dignified, "I heard that a huge fleet landed in Haifeng County, looting along the east coast coastline, even the church has not let go, many fjords The merchants have also been embarrassed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There have been a large number of fugitives in the East, and Hogg and I have taken in a lot," Margaret added. "They said that the looters not only robbed the money, but also let people not let go. The things that did not go were burned, like the whole east. This turned into a white, just east exit of each rein aristocratic Ti Feike, it is definitely a heavy blow "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;.. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
