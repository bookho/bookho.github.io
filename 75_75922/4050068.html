			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fjord, sleep island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the winter approaches, the sea breeze that passes over the island becomes colder. Even if the window is closed, Tilly can still hear the cold wind passing through the gap from time to time. Sharp whistling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there are probably not many people who are willing to wander around the house, but in fact, people in the central square of Sleeping Island are celebrating at any time, a grand bonfire The dance has been going on for a few days, and the hot fish soup has been boiled for one pot and another pot. The witches have their ability to display the square into a pleasant paradise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there aren’t many things to deal with, Tilly wants to join the carnival and share with everyone the joy of the church being defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since she brought this news back, the lives of the witches have changed radically - not the changing conditions of life, but the spirit has been It becomes completely different. Everyone seems to have unloaded the shoulders, and the eyes have a more fascinating look than before. The words and deeds can also see obvious relaxation and freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that moment on, they finally did not have to live under fear and fear. The mountains that were pressed against the top of the head collapsed, and the dense haze disappeared, even if it was whistling The wind can't dispel the enthusiasm of their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the taste of Roland’s "liberation", Tilly thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the sleeping island housekeeper Camilla Darry knocked on the door and entered the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Highness, the witch who is willing to go to the West, I have done preliminary statistics," she sat cross-legged across Tilly, putting a stack of shorts On the table, "almost half of the people signed up to support the West."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it better than I expected, hard work." Tilly smiled Nodded, pick up the list and look carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About moving to the West, the five kings’ statement to the island’s witches is to support the construction of no winter city to defend against a bigger disaster - the battle of God 's arrival <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to let everyone make choices that are loyal to their wishes, Tilly did not conceal the news of the witch empire, the federation and the devil, but clearly told everyone that the church It is part of the federation, and the real enemy of people is the devil from the outside world. They have no mercy and no mercy, so helping the West is also helping themselves. Of course, even if you live on the island, the rest of your life is not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought that many sisters would be intimidated by new enemies, or they would have been tired of dealing with ordinary people and have doubts about an uncertain future. And thus decided to stay on the island. However, judging from the statistics of nearly half of the number of people, those who have never met the devil are far less horrible than the church, and the witch’s longing for the outside world has not been extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are interested in defeating the four princes of the Pope, and they want to see what the lord of the witch enemies is," Camilla is helpless. He sighed. "And it's also very important. Your brother's identity also adds a lot to him. They have also transferred their trust to him."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't seem to be relieved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, he is a nobleman, an ordinary person, and we have The difference in essence... and I am blunt, for the sake of profit, sometimes blood is a hindrance.” The big housekeeper frowned slightly. “His Highness, I am not questioning your decision, nor is it saying that your brother is on both sides, but In case...I mean, what should we do if the things he seeks are contrary to the interests of the witch, and then raise the butcher knife again like other nobles?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand your concerns, this decision is that I will consider doing it again and again. Tilly put down the list and held Camilla's hand. "The witch may be different from the ordinary, but under the threat of the war of divineity, we have a common goal, that is to live. In the world of secularism, why not join this opportunity to form an inseparable community of interests with ordinary people? When our ability penetrates into various fields, even if Roland wants to repent and agree with the island, it is impossible to leave the power of the witch. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...will he let go of our control?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
