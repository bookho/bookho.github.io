			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噗--cough," Roland almost didn't get caught in saliva, a body that was slightly fat, always curled up with curls, white face, thick fingers The short guy suddenly came to mind. He almost forgot the guy, but as soon as he heard the name, the other person would immediately jump out of his memory and look as if he had just left yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that after all, the four princes are really good at wearing a pair of trousers – they have never been able to fit into Goron, Tiffco and Garcia. After the circle was rebelled by Tilic, the mentality of the four princes was completely out of balance and became self-defeating. The appearance of Joel saved him, not only took him out of the flowers, let him taste the pleasures of the nobility, but also entangled a group of friends and friends for him to drink and feel the prestige that the palace could never experience. Not to say how correct these things are, at least at the time, the four princes regarded him as his best friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland wanted to reject the sir, but the fragments in the memory made him realize that if it was the Four Princes, he would certainly not do so. And he also needs someone to stand up at this moment, to attract the remaining little nobles to work for themselves. After pondering for a moment, he finally decided to see the "magic hand" of the popular king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bring the jazz to my study," he commanded. "Remember to confiscate his stone of punishment."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the crown tower, Roland soon waited for the "old friend." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, my God, my majesty... I didn't expect you to come back so fast, and easily defeated your devil brother!" The four princes always refer to their brothers and sisters as the devils, so that in private no one, Joel will also echo this statement. The image of the other party is almost the same as the memory. When he just pushed the door into the study, he stepped forward and a passionate hug caught Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter helplessly patted his back like in the past. "I didn't expect you to come to the door so soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s difficult to relate to the title of Playboy despite its plain appearance, but the round chin always gives a sense of intimacy, plus a clean The beard, the clean and decent clothes, the right perfume, and the legendary skillful technique are not incapable of capturing the hearts of many ladies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am different from them! The coward is still scolding Fei Ke's Yu Wei, and I know that you will not let him go!" Tao, "Since I am back, would you like to go to Jinsifang tonight to have a drink? Do you want me to be Mrs. Joss or Miss Kingfisher? They have missed you since the last time. ——”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland suddenly felt a chill coming behind him, and his cold eyes penetrated his body and went straight to Joel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the jazz is not so good, his voice is abruptly stopped, so he looks around, "How are you...how suddenly it gets cold?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is *** ,, I have nothing to do with them," Roland quickly vetoed, "What do the two think about nothing to do with me!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is related, it is also the relationship of the four princes... It’s totally different for the real "self", so this denial is also the truth from the heart, nightingale There should be no difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, after this answer, the coolness was reduced a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Is it..." Joel touched his chin. "You can stay with them for a night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At that time, there was a curfew, I couldn’t go back to the palace, couldn’t I sleep on the street,” Roland stressed. “In short, I didn’t do anything that night, understand? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a hint of doubt on the other side of the face, but it quickly returned to the original smile. "Well, then regardless of them, change a few new ones today." You don't know, there is a more upscale brothel opposite the Jinsifang. I heard that the quality is fast enough to catch up with the nobles, and I need an invitation to enter. I have never had the chance to experience it. You are sure there is no problem. , how?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I will stay in the palace at night, and I will not go anywhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
