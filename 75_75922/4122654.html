			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chieftain did not meet her in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia followed Wendy into the living room on the first floor of the castle and found a stranger in addition to Roland Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the other side curiously, and the latter was watching her, but the wolf woman was slightly uncomfortable with the woman’s eyes I looked at it as if I wanted to see her naked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are here," Roland is still a relaxed and gentle look. "I am looking for you because there is a new mission to be handed over to you, sit down." Let's talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," After six months without the winter city, Luo Jia also basically figured out the temperament of the great chieftain, not lifting the etiquette, and lifting the tail. I sat down directly opposite the woman. "But please allow me to report a message about the extreme south."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Raise your eyebrows, "You said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia repeated the voice heard by his father, "I feel that the Iron Sands clan poses no threat to the clear water port. However, it is better to raise some vigilance. It takes a lot of effort to open a piece of land, but it is easy to destroy it, especially if the main force of the first army returns to the absence of the winter city."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be the case," Roland touched his chin. "In fact, when the migration plan was formulated, the staff had already had this. The considerations have been almost a year now, and they should be prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia thinks thoughtfully, "they mean..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You guessed it right," Roland said with a smile. "Before the threat of the war of gods was lifted, the First Army could not have taken into account the kingdom. The corners, the things in the extreme south, have to rely on local power to solve them." He paused. "Of course, I have to express my gratitude to your father. If he is willing to step in, the matter will be more stable." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I can write a letter to my father." The wolf girl consciously replied, until she said that she had inadvertently stood. There is no winter city...or the perspective of the great chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since it is political negotiation, let me come," Roland waved his hand. "Not to mention that I am not looking for you to discuss such a serious problem. First introduce First, the lady around me is called May, you may have heard of her other title: Star of the West."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Star Flower... Theatre Company? Luo Jiawei sneaked a little, she didn't have much interest in drama. Even the name was known from the echo. I only know that there are two actors who are very popular with no winter people. The Star Flower Troupe also got it. name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what does this have to do with her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the three princesses of the mad flame clan? It’s a desert nation, it’s really not the same as us." Mey finally put away the review. The eyes, got up and gracefully bowed to her, "First time, Miss Luo Jia, after the cooperation, please advise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooperation? Luo Jia looked blankly at the big chief. The other party was neither a witch, nor did she have the ability to perform as an echo. Where did the cooperation start? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it," Roland raised his lips. "Do you remember what I said, would you want more people to accept witches who are similar in your ability?" The soul should not be related to the appearance, whether they have different parts from ordinary people or face scales, it is still a member of us. To do this, drama is undoubtedly the quickest way. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like me to play the drama?" Luo Jia was a little panicked. Although he was determined not to cover his ears and tail, the locals did not show her. There has been a clear rejection, but this is completely different from deliberately standing in the eyes of the public. "But I don't know anything about it. It's not something I'm good at. Not to mention that I don't feel the obvious malice in the absence of winter city. Maybe you should find someone else..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured," Roland seemed to see the thoughts in her heart. "You don't have to perform in front of everyone, the viewers are not winterless." This is an unprecedented attempt, I call it Doing electricity... No, "magic shadow." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
