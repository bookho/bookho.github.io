			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is simple, the material that can be stripped from the whole, traces back to the whole body, and can also find a large amount of it through a certain trace element. Convergence point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Sleeping Island witch, this is undoubtedly a kind of partial survival ability. For example, if you hold a drop of fresh water, Ajima can bring you to find Streams or lakes; for example, based on the remains of the animal's excrement, she can determine the location and size of the fruit forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the ability to contribute to the team, there are several Eastern witches who have gathered together and become a very close small group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the eyes of Roland, "retrospecting the source" is undoubtedly the target of exploring natural resources, and its versatility is even stronger than the magical eye of Hillvi . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is very simple, the dimension consumption of Sylvia in the perspective of the formation will be multiplied, the distance is also greatly reduced, the division of the mineral layer for the North Slope mining area can be competent, once She was powerless when she switched to a vein buried deep in the ground. In addition, even if it is a shallow resource, it is difficult for her to distinguish the type and scale of the target. At most, she can only say that there is something underground, but she can't say what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akima has no such concerns at all, not only can the precise positioning of a single resource, but also a clear understanding of its reserves. If used in conjunction with Lucia's purification capabilities, you may be able to move the entire periodic table of elements to the Grey Fort map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Roland studied geography, the most impressive thing was a map of the country with a variety of resources. Now the Grey Fort has achieved nominal unification, and he should In this direction, we will expand the source of raw materials to the whole country, even the dawn and the fertile plains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if Akima is not willing to help, it is not something that is difficult to recover for the absence of winter city. After all, resources will not run, as long as he gives plenty of time, he This is always achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doris's "magicization" is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limited by the lack of observation means, his research on magic is not even in the door, want to better control it, the witch is the only way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devilization is such an incredible ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty’s description in the book is: it can make the magic attached to the dead form a cycle, which greatly slows down the exhaustion and makes it look like It is a life that is general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has reservations about this evaluation. He knows that the dead in the witch’s mouth cannot have magic but is a habitual statement—although in most cases, This rule will come into effect, but there is also an exception, which is the stone of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joint experiment between Isabella and Ai Gesha shows that the god stone does have magic, or ... the ability to attract magic, which was originally exclusive to the awakened Characteristics. When Isabella wiped out the interference area of ​​the stone, its surface was able to observe a very subtle magic residue, but only lasted for a few seconds. In the whole process, there is no third party to inject magic into it, so the remaining magic must belong to the stone itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, although the stone of God's punishment does not have the high concentration of magic that can disable other abilities, as he speculated before, it does contain magic. Only the content is extremely rare. As for why the ability to isolate is still to be studied, Roland can at least be certain that the term "magic exclusion of dead objects" is not entirely correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that Isabella’s adjusted stone will soon become a piece of stone, Ai Gesha made a bold guess: the stone of God’s punishment The magic power will continue to be lost, but it can absorb new magic like the living body, making it a cycle, like the gravel on the beach, absorbing the sun during the day and releasing them at night. Otherwise, it cannot be explained that Isabella's ability did not involve the structure of the stone, but it completely changed its nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She believes that the god stone was "killed" by Isabella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wendy’s statement is obviously following the conclusion of Aegusa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland doesn’t care, he always feels that the god stone vein is a kind of dead thing, and the ability to breathe the magic is not related to whether it is dead or not. It is unknown that human beings know too little, just as humans knew nothing about the microcosm before the microscope was invented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
