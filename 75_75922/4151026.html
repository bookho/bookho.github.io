			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fort, no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report on the war in Dagong Island and the situation of the wolf heart was sent to Roland in two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes a week longer than the previous letter from North East Yong Night City to no winter. The speed of such communication cannot be said to be huge. Whether it's a short-haul delivery of a flight messenger or a long-distance journey of a steamship day and night, it is now integrated into a part of the messaging system, and every important message is equipped with a special boat or even a plane. This time the report was sent by Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s hard for you." Roland asked for a chaotic drink, "Where is the situation over there?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if I read the report?" Tilly took the cup and gave him a look. "Behaving so diligently, what are you guilty about? Isn't my special machine still a bit clue?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "噗..." came a laughter from the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come, I have chosen the most suitable one from several programs. As long as Anna pulls out the space, I can start trial production immediately. Roland said quickly. "You also know that several projects have recently reached the most critical step. She is really busy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at Anna's I don’t care about you this time, my brother.” Tilly took a drink and wiped her mouth and walked outside the office. “The Seagull is about to return, I will go back to the Knights College. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't stay one day?" He was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no way, now the front line can threaten the Scorpio Lord only Seagull and Andrea, and ... I don't want to miss any chance of revenge. Tilly waved his back to him. "Then I am gone, my brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the door that was re-covered, the nightingale sighed softly. "Everyone...has to work hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can, I hope they work harder on other aspects than war. Roland’s thoughts floated on the bottom of his mind, but he did not say anything – because no one could rest this burden until the fate of humanity was decided before the end of the war of divine war. It is no longer meaningful to say that this is in addition to evading responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a moment of silence, he opened the report seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading all the reports, Roland finally understood the meaning of Tilly’s sentence. Can promptly issue the retreat order, and successfully ambushed a demon in the sea, no trace of the devil, the king, Itis Kant and Andrea is undoubtedly the biggest hero of this battle. But again, the sender of the key intelligence can not be ignored - without this person's desperate fight, there will be no victory behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do?" This incident obviously attracted the attention of the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what his original intention of sending out this secret letter, his name and merits should not be forgotten." Roland said. If it is a past life, it is almost impossible to find an unidentified eyeliner after the end of the long war. I am afraid that the tombstone will only leave something like "Your name is unknown, and your merits will last forever." Inscription. But the witch can change this lasting situation, so that every soldier who contributes to the fate of mankind can stay in the history. "When the Yongdong Kingdom returns to the control of the First Army, let "black money" cooperate with Axia to confirm his identity and origin. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the murderer who killed him was still alive, he would not escape the severe punishment of the law.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Night nodded, "If you said that the equipment that can communicate over a thousand miles can be made early." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately that is not my strength." Roland couldn't help but lick his forehead. When he thought of the circuit diagram that was forcibly memorized, he felt a headache.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you can finally understand the feelings of my exam. It is. "The nightingale is covering your mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But even if it’s hard, I won’t fall asleep on the table like someone else, and I can only hand it in. White rolls," Roland glanced at her. "In fact, I have already completed the manufacture of the prototype. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
