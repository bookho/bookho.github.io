			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night found that he guessed it right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the mixed species can't directly determine her position, and it is even less to climb the rock wall to block her, and the flying species in the midair "dive" Although it is quite powerful, it seems to be the arrow that has lost its head. As long as it keeps moving, it will be difficult to pose a sufficient threat to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that can "see" her is the only beasts that carry the sickle-like front paws - they wiggle the sturdy body, many of the abdomen The foot penetrates into the rock like a nail, so that it can come and go freely on the rock wall. Instructed by the monsters, they gathered at the top of the cave and stopped between her and the guard eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These enemies are undoubtedly the obstacles that she must first break through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad dome became the battlefield of the nightingale, and the feeling of being alone has not been seen for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once she walked alone under the night, vengeance to those nobles who did not do evil, until Wendy found the whereabouts of the AIDS, let her get rid of that life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time it is completely different from the feeling of being in the Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a person, but she is not tired and hateful. She is not forced or threatened, but spontaneously enters this dangerous competition. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protect the belief of a companion that makes her heart burn like a flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the nightingale didn’t feel lonely, she wore a special protective suit from Soroa, and the backpack contained the explosives produced by Ai Gesha and the guns at the waist. It was designed by Roland himself - it was also engraved with a gift, "To Veronica". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes her feel like she is with everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts are constantly changing, the distance between the two sides is constantly shortening, the enemy has gradually completed the encirclement, holding a sickle to press her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of sixteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale pulled out the pistol and opened the insurance. When the front animal was only a few steps away from her, she got out of the fog and pulled the trigger. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party also rushed out at that moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful tail and the acropod give it a terrible burst of speed, which is like a predator rushing to the prey, almost in the blink of an eye. completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not so much that a bullet hits it, it’s better to say it hit a bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is hit, the rest of the force can cause serious injuries to the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the latter is ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the child popped up, she re-entered the fog and stepped on a fast receding outline - the outline of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timing is just right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of outsiders, she seems to suddenly pull back a few meters, but in fact, the earth is carrying her backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘭!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projectile penetrates straight into the sharp-minded bag of the sickle beast and puts it The carapace and the brain are turned together, like a blooming flower bud. The magic radiance dissipates at a speed visible to the naked eye, and the invisible body twitches to reveal the original shape. The alien animal that lost its vitality fell into the underground lake like a stone. In her eyes, it quickly rose, as if it had been sucked in by the raging lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale uses the unpredictable lines of the fog to chase and kill the enemy on the dome. Although the beasts are quick-moving, gravity still imposes a heavy burden on them, especially when she deliberately lures her opponent back and forth to the already battled ground. The rock that is nailed to the hole is obviously unable to provide enough. Friction, which caused them to slow down and insert the foot into a deeper place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
