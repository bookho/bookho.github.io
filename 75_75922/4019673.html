			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn Glow City, Wang Palace Garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto Losey and Oro Tokat both sneaked into the back of a rockery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s not completely sneaky—at least when they walk into the palace, they are passing through the gate in front of the guards. As long as they don't go to the palace restricted area, their actions will not be hindered. All the guards know that the Losey and Tokat families have always been the loyal supporters of the royal family, and the two will take over as the grand prince's governing minister after taking over the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, do you really want to do this?" Otto couldn't help but feel nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the morning light of the morning sun is often a forbidden zone, then the palace in the castle is a restricted area in the restricted area. And they know a secret passage from the garden to the palace. This narrow underground passage should be one of several escape routes in the palace. When I was young, I explored with Andrea and Prince Anpein. The four also took It acts as its own secret base and occasionally hosts a small gathering in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, at that time they were only about ten years old, even if they were discovered by Moya, they were most scorned. But now that the two have grown up and then sneaked into the palace privately, what do you think? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please, the three join forces to find out why Annpein is unfamiliar. Isn't that what you proposed?" Oro grinned. "Now it's the key." At that time, you actually want to back down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." Otto opened his mouth and paused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I am really convinced you, actually use Andrea's recent situation to set the tone of Queen Quinn, if not for you, she is from childhood Big playmates, change to other people, I think the thing that the old man wants to do most is to kill people." Oro said while looking at the probe. "Now is the best moment to know the truth, you are not doing it." Dry?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto hesitated for a moment and nodded his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the news revealed by Count Quinn is really amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since his illness fell, the prince often met an alchemist in the palace, and he also asked the person visiting the hospital to leave the palace. I heard that you can wake up one or two hours a day, that is, the person used special drugs to suppress the disease. Andrea's father, as the former prime minister, naturally had the opportunity to go to the palace to ask his majesty for political affairs. He had seen the alchemist, the other person was actually a young woman, and the whole body was under the black gauze. Only see her bleak silver-gray pupil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to these words, Otto thought of the church in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he didn’t go to the Grey Fort, he wouldn’t associate in this regard, but after seeing Roland Wimbledon, about the church secretly training the pure, And the news of subverting the power of the four kingdoms and accumulating strength to meet the war of the end has already taken root in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally did not tell the information to Count Quinn, after all, this matter has a great impact, he must confirm his guess is correct before making the next decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl learned that the alchemist would appear today, and Otto immediately thought of this secret passage that he often entered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is impossible to get the support of the great prince, he can only find the truth in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his nod, Oro immediately took action - kicking the knee-high weeds and using the dagger to pick up a piece of rock behind the rockery The cover, the rusty iron railings soon appeared in front of the two. This fence is almost one arm long and wide, and can only be opened from the inside with a key, but it is difficult to fall back to the two people who have been prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oro pulled out a glass bottle from his pocket, uncovered the lid, and poured the yellow-brown liquid from the bottle in the lock position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white nose with a snot of nose suddenly swells, and the railings that are immersed in the liquid make a sound, like the butter thrown into the hot pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the molten iron prepared by the masters of the Glory City Alchemy. The size of the fist is more than a dozen gold dragons, and the process is not as claimed by the other party. In the blink of an eye, the iron can be turned into a pool of black water, and two bottles are poured out, and the two-ring lock is reduced to fall off the railing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
