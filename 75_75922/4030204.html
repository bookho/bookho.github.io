			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A total of three people, all died in the shack under the stage." The presiding judge nodded. "The beacon's watcher is rotated once a week, so I When I went to the scene, the body was stinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, so the bonfire is not for them, but for others," Soli The boxing on the desk, extremely angry, "Is this deliberately teasing us? Or is it a reason to fight for the holy city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The reason is not clear, but the adult, the mouth of a mouse is very interesting," he pointed to the report, "I deliberately remember the last page."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial Long turn to the end, I have to go through the grass. "Two weeks ago, someone under the Windwind Ridge set up a card along the road, prohibiting anyone from going to the desolate mountains, but not stopping the people on the mountain?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case, he originally planned to go to Glentown to try his luck, but saw a caravan that should have been to Hermes. Stopped."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that it’s really not the lord?" Solis groaned. "Wait... two weeks ago? When was the last time the dealer appeared?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three days ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop The face sank instantly. "That is, this name does not allow anyone to go to the level of the mountains to release the group of dealers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is simply coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are a group of people." The presiding judge replied, "At least it looks like a group."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people are there at the checkpoint?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mouse just looked at it from a distance, and it is estimated that there are hundreds of people."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just as long as the tail is exposed," Soli Darr stood up. "Call me to order the judges to come together!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;" Bishop, do you want to go downhill?" The presiding judge first glimpsed, and then quickly dissuaded him. "The command of His Majesty is to allow us to take the place after the Windwind Ridge, to ensure that the mountain road is unblocked and waiting for the army. Dispatch... If you want to catch a few people to ask about the situation, it is enough to send a small team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't just want to catch a few tongues, but also Grinding their checkers into powder, this is the price of teasing the holy city!" Soli waved his hand impatiently. "If you do, I will see their head hanging at the gate of the city the day after tomorrow." This has no effect on the holy city's combat plan. Your Majesty will not blame."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if the enemy sets an ambush..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ambly?" Soli took a look at him. "I led the army to attack the Broken Fort of the Wolfheart Kingdom. It was an extremely difficult hard battle." But even if it relies on Xiongguanjunling, the ambush of ordinary people can only bring some trouble to the gods, but not to the open flat area at the foot of the mountain. Any action of ambushing the gods will be tantamount to suicide, I hope They really have the courage, not the wind." The Archbishop paused here. "If you understand it, go and execute my order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ......Yes, an adult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the back of the presiding judge, Soli Darr showed a sneer, he would never let go of the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There are a large group of people in the cold wind ridge?" The iron axe looked at the fat pigeons that flew into the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost a thousand people!" McMillan flapped his wings. "There is no car for transporting food, nor the militia. They are wearing armor. Some people carry giant shields and short spears!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Major Shield?" Iron axe swears, "How big?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔..." Mai Hao looked at him. "It’s almost like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
