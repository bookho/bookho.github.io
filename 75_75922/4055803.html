			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, even after more than four hundred years, the name has been blurred, but the scene is still vivid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blue-haired witch kneels down in front of the three seats of the Federation, and takes over the robes and scepters who symbolize the high-ranking advances and accepts The secret will be the blessing of the person in charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventy-sixth deep remember, she turned to the posture of the scepter under the ceremony - as the youngest born in the era of Taqila The high-level witch, her look of pride and self-confidence, is imprinted in the hearts of all the onlookers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the 76th was only one member of the defending team, an original fighting witch. At that time, she looked at the younger generation who was full of enthusiasm. Her heart had only infinite envy and a sense of inferiority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that this witch is Ai Gesha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pieces of memories that are filled with dust instantly reappear in my mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She even remembered that later, because of some extraordinary behavior, the other party violated the principle that the Quest will never hire mortals, and was excluded from the core research circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ai Gesha did not repent, and established his own research tower outside the city of Tacharia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of her status and identity, no one has stopped this behavior. If the original witch dares to openly confront the Quest, I am afraid it will be ordered by a paper. Dispatched to the front line of the battle until it became a member of the list of deaths in the bloody defensive war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the 76th, there was still some dissatisfaction. She believed that in the current situation of the enemy, she should not make such a move. For the Quest, It is equal to the loss of a young and promising promoter, and for her, she has lost most of the resources and foundation to explore the mystery of the magic stone. Adding the two together is the loss of the holy city of Taqila. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, all the dissatisfaction has long since disappeared with the fall of the federation, and the disappearance of more than four hundred years has disappeared without a trace. Now she is left in her heart. Full of joy... and incredible surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joy is that she can actually meet a Taqila witch here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surprisingly, how did the Taqila witch survive to the present? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, Ai Gesha still maintains the body of the witch, and even looks and ages seem to stay in that era, even the traces of old age can not see To! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of other survivors has long since become a bone, only the soul is preserved through special methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#76 The best efforts were made to restrain the urge to stop her immediately, and watched her leave without moving until the gate of the courtyard was closed again. I took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She already knows what to do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come, what problems have you found?" The day is getting late, whistling When the cold wind became paralyzed again, the nightingale noticed a slight change in the expression of Hillvi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I left the diplomatic building on the 76th and jumped out of the window of the second floor corridor." The latter replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Nightingale raised an eyebrow. "Don't those windows be sealed with iron railings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably rusted, the whole window frame swayed and fell off." Sylvie stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window, overlooking the city that slowly disappeared into the darkness. "She turned out the wall, the doorway." The guards did not find any movement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it was discovered by us," said the nightingale, "She really has a problem!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Rolandâ€™s safety is more important, she called Sylvie and watched the tour of the group directly in the castle office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
