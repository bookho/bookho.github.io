			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly four months, I returned to Bianbu Town again, and Lotus had a new feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This town seems to be growing, even if the snowy days are not preventing its expansion, every time you board the Chishui Bridge, this The feeling is particularly obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A factory building is like a neat square, arranged on the south bank of the river, and the dock area opposite it has grown several times, and many tows can be seen at any time. The smoky stone boat came back and forth on the river, covering the original sparkling river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s more lively than the sleeping island," honey squatted down the bridge railing. "There are many people like ants."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too." When she remembered that the bridge was just built, she still couldn’t understand why she wanted to make the bridge deck so spacious, and it felt a bit wasteful. Now look Come, this decision is just right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of people on both sides of the strait. From time to time, someone will look at the two of them and seem to be very curious about their dress and appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in other cities, Lian estimates have to consider how to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these changes that can be seen at a glance, there are many improvements in life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, it is a heating system that makes people feel warm, a bright light that shines at night, and a new food that replaces ice cream bread. ... These she can listen to Evelyn and candlelight all day, but they are not the most amazing of the lotus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, what makes her feel the biggest change is the relationship between the witch and the ordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be seen in the pub opened by Evelyn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub is funded by the Witch Alliance, and Evelyn is the manager and bartender, who mixes delicious and delicious drinks for guests who are patronizing the West. It is said that this is also the idea of ​​His Majesty. - Instead of letting the witches' pay in the drawers, it's better to take out some business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lian was invited by Wendy, went there to drink two glasses of iced cider, the taste is really good, there is a mellow smell of ale, and mixed with rich The fruity flavours, which are clean and light green in a transparent crystal glass, look quite attractive. And the environment is not as complicated and chaotic as a regular pub. The guests are basically sitting at their desks and drinking and talking. The ground, the table and the wine are cleaned up. If it is not the row of barrels behind the bar, she simply This place will not be associated with a pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is also related to the price of alcohol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evelyn stood at the bar and talked to the guest like a regular store manager. No one would scream or scold because she was a witch. Many foreign businessmen have come to drink because of curiosity. Lian also rarely saw her smile so happy - I can see that she really likes the job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lian remembers that before the departure of the witch, most of the witch’s activities were basically within the castle area. If they need to go out, they will usually have their guards to follow the protection. Now they It has gradually integrated into every part of the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one winter, it is incredible to make such a big change in the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Wendy’s night talks gave her a deeper understanding – perhaps this is why the Alliance’s witches are willing to do everything for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are not only building a winter city for Roland, but also building their own home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go," Lian Chao honey nunou mouth. "If it goes well, you can complete the transformation of the seaport today."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When The last piece of rock sank into the ground, and the lotus wiped the fine sweat on the forehead and made a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
