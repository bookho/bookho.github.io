			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night never felt so self-blame and remorse in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought that as long as she stayed with Roland, no one could hurt him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she is still standing in the castle bedroom in Glentown, there is no bruise on the whole body, Roland is lying in bed, unconscious . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not see any magical reaction in his body, and the internal organs are equally intact, neither a curse like the rest of the species, nor a direct destruction of the organs. The ability to kill, even the well-informed Ai Gesha, can not see the type of this ability and the method of cracking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of conventional wake-up methods are exhausted, still to no avail, Roland has no reaction to the outside stimulation, if there is not breathing and heartbeat, I am afraid there is nothing to death. the difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She now finally understands the admonition of Ai Gesha-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the power of the witch, There is no absolute safety protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, this insight came too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the rapid footsteps coming from outside the door, lightning pushed open the door and loudly, "The pure man woke up!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witch in the room suddenly became excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry, it doesn't make sense to run around and explore," Wendy said. "And we don't know her ability. For safety reasons, it's still the first." It’s better to ask Miss Aisha and the nightingale to ask the situation.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a predecessor trusted by her sister, her calm tone calmed everyone down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale took a deep breath and nodded to Wendy, "Give it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp During her years of escape, she knew that negative emotions did not have any benefit in changing the situation. Especially at this critical moment, she must not evade her responsibility because she made a big mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She must bring down Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go," Aegusa sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving the room, the nightingale couldn’t help but look back and saw Anna sitting on the bed and still sitting still, her eyes still watching Roland, as if Everything else can no longer attract her attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of guilt is stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A servant room on the castle floor has been converted into a special prison room. The walls of its four walls are embedded with dozens of stones of the gods, and the black holes formed are layered together to form a cage for isolation. Only by standing in the middle of the room can you drive the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale naturally knows who they are to interrogate. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war, the First Army soldiers found three still-lived purifiers in the square pit of No. 3 trench, one person taking off, one being coma, the only one The awake person shivered. It is known from her mouth that there are five pure people hidden in the ground, namely, Jieluo, Isabella, Hazel, Maggie and Vanilla - and the last one is herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to vanilla, she and Maggie were only responsible for confirming Roland’s position and transporting three others into the battlefield, knowing little about the rest. As for the cleansing, Isabella and the black gauze are pure to the management of the pope, the status is equal to the archbishop, the ability is also the secret of the Holy See, very few people know the details. Now that the black yarn has died, the cleansing has disappeared, and the only breakthrough is only Isabella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for Isabella’s coma is that after the examination, it is now the loss of consciousness caused by the exhaustion of magic, as long as it waits for a day or two, it will naturally recover. . In addition, in her hands, she also found a broken and eccentric mark, but because of the destruction of the magic stone, Ai Gesha could not recognize what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
