			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is there such a magical form! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell dare not "touch" the metal edge - this is her unique way of perceiving magic, she can see after connecting the channel Touching and even smelling the magic of the witches is like walking into their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The metal surface is hard and cold, smooth like a mirror, and every detail of the tentacles is clear. When it touched the cube, it was quickly bounced off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Relax," the woman Marquis said comfortably. "This thing is not harmful to you." But she is not sure whether her ability can be hard on this piece. The metal works - Anna's magic seems to be unable to flow at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After trying a few times, the tentacles were finally attached to the cube. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the magic is unresponsive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" The nightingale saw something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never...have delivered a similar magical power, it is too big, and it doesn't look like it can flow," Speer thought the throat was dry. "After the channel is connected, the magic should be absorbed by the "central". "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I try to inject magic into it," Anna said suddenly. "It's like using a divine print." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful not to output too much at a time," His Highness nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is it? Speer found that since he came to the town, he could hear several new words that are unclear every day.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her doubts, The magic in Anna’s body suddenly changed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perfect mirror was broken at this moment, the metal block was smashed, and the dull liquid was like what Pushing the ball into the air, the ball is swarming into the floating ball.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she feels the weight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This liquid is extremely heavy. It is different from the previous transfer of magical cyclone. When it flows into the center, it is like stuffing iron ingots. Speer finds that his magic consumption is increasing rapidly.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also incredible. Previously, the ability to display can easily last for more than half a day, but now she finds that this trend continues. It may not last for a quarter of an hour.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In desperation, she had to take a tentacles from the center and connect herself to the body to use the magic provided by the other to maintain the channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the ball of light is fully filled, Anna’s metal cubes still maintain their original form, as if these magical powers are just a negligible part.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell really wants to swallow the words that he said before, she coughed twice, "Hey... the channel has been able to provide magic for Miss Mystery, and pick up What should I do next? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Keep it alive," said Roland, who gave a cylinder like a bronze cast to the mystery moon. "After seeing you." . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well! "The latter took a deep breath, holding the copper column with both hands and closing his eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic moments flow wildly.<br /><br />&nbsp Speer saw the metal block in Anna's body shimmering, the liquid in the center was constantly pumped out, and it was filled quickly. The whole passage kept shaking, like the magic that could be rushed at any time. Shredded. The marquis’s sweat on her forehead felt like she was standing in front of a overwhelming tsunami.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other end, the brow of the mystery Slightly cheeky, cheeks flushed, obviously also suffering from the impact of the wave. However, compared to just transshipment, she should be much more affected. Even so, she did not stop the ability to perform, the magic of rapid consumption is Proof.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
