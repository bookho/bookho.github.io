			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When entering the living room on the 76th, four witches were sitting around the round table and assigned food from the new attendants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning," Amy took the lead to say hello to her. "Come and have breakfast, this time in addition to bread, fried eggs and milk. I haven't tasted such a hearty meal for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," she pretended to be happy and sat next to Amy - losing her taste After that, the food was only to meet the needs of the body, and the process of eating completely became a torture. But hundreds of years of tempering have allowed her to swallow these crumb-like odorless things, and to make corresponding praises according to the increasingly thin impression in memory. "Oh... this is really good." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Amy said vaguely as she chewed the egg. "The last time I ate fried eggs, it was more than a year ago... ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not show off for more than a year!" The sword broke out and protested, "I haven't eaten it for almost ten years." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough..." Anne cleared her throat. "And from the people who haven't eaten eggs since birth."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" The three have a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I." Annie pointed at herself. "When still in the village, the neighbor next door raised a group of old hens. I always wanted to climb in and steal an egg. I tasted it, and the first time I tried it, I was found by the old man, and I almost didn’t kill the rolling pin.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your father is really an honest person. ," the hero admired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Integrity?” She shrugged. “He was just afraid of being discovered by the neighbors and went to the door to ask for compensation. I touched the eggs and fed him. And the younger brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living room suddenly fell into a short silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, or eat first," the hero snarled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噗..." Amy smiled first. "Ha ha ha... It turned out to be the case... haha..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the first one, others can’t help but laugh out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even on the 76th, I couldn’t help but raise my mouth. This group of witches who struggled to survive all day finally found a place to live. Here, She seems to see the shadow of the prosperous period of Tacula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no longer a shadow, she told herself that here is about to become a new holy city, the witch will inevitably rise again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the winner has already appeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, didn't you sleep well yesterday?" Amy reached out and wiped the corner of the seventy-sixth corner. "It's all black."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...probably," bowed on the 76th. "I was so excited that I didn't fall asleep yesterday."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it takes only one or two hours of deep sleep to restore the spirit, but it does not mean that she can sleep all day, the excessive use of the soul will still be manifested in the body, for them, this is The biggest taboo. After all, if the body is damaged or aging, it can be replaced, and the soul is created to be permanent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but how can she sleep? Or, she didn't want to fall into the dormancy of the darkness - on the 76th, she was afraid that everything was a dream. When she woke up, the winner would disappear without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What she needs to do most now is to find out who the owner of the orange light is and to contact Pasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is not an easy task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When listening to Wendy’s statement, most of the sisters live in the Witch Building in the Castle District. She is not a witch, so she can’t join the Alliance by joining the Alliance. Rely on, perhaps only these wolf witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
