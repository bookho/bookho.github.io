			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noise of the scene suddenly solidified, and even the passengers in front of the bar put down their glasses and turned their attention to the troupe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei couldn’t help but swear, "I was in Mr. Kajin when I was in the old kingdom-"<br /><br />&nbsp ; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "pointing to it as such, he did not want to see you?." steward low voice said, <br /> < "Cajun Excellency'm disappointed in you, ah, Miss Mey." br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Although the phrase is revealed in her ear, but the companion side still hear each other's answers, Mey felt his hands grasp the moment is Irene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement is more stringent than accusation, especially when it comes from a master of drama. For the younger generation, their blame can be either criticism or high hope, but disappointment is another meaning. If she is replaced by her three years ago, I am afraid that she will be overwhelmed on the spot and even sobbing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the first thing she thinks of today is not herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has become the star of the West, and the pillars of the Star Flower Troupe have a considerable degree of self-affirmation in both acting and ability. If she is even hit hard by this, what should I do after Irene and Dina? Not to mention the talent is still good, but the lack of confidence in the swallows. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; therefore Mey found himself unexpectedly calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed out and responded in an orderly manner, "Is it? I think there may be some misunderstandings in this, if it is natural to explain it in person, if not I can only apologize in this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that she would be so understated, and she could not help but frown. "You... ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, I hope that Mr. Kajin can go further in the drama and make new breakthroughs in the ceremony, we will not bother." In two steps, I went back and said, "In addition, please don't call me Miss Mey. I am now Mrs. Lannis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather on the way back No change, Mayi felt that the sky was a lot gloomy, and the group was silent, completely absent from the active and excited at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the two are about to be separated, Gate couldn’t help but ask, "May, you really and Kajin Master--"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stupid, what is stupid!" Luo Xia glared at him. "If Mei Yi had a holiday with him before, how could he take the initiative to visit?" He, isn't it boring? If you say disappointment, I think it's awkward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people took a breath and didn't dare Looking at her confidently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...the person you said, but the master of the grey castle..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Where is it," Luo Xia is not in a hurry. "No winter city has become a new king capital. The Star Flower Troupe is the most popular performance team in the West. Their status has dropped. Naturally, it will not give us good." Look at me. I followed Mei Yi’s sister from Long Song to Bianbu Town. After she returned from the old king, she never dealt with the Kajin Theatre. How did the word disappoint? I don't think we have a short time to set up, and there is no fame in the eyes of the nobility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that true?" Irene suddenly realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably the reason why Luo Xia’s insults are so arrogant, so that everyone has recovered a little spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think I can look directly at Mei Yi, it seems to be guilty..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"So so Master Kajin does not want to see Mei Yi sister for this reason?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s strange!" Mayi finally couldn’t help but roll up. White-eyed, "With his fame, what needs to be used to swear at me? Out of the West, almost no one knows who I am, but in the entire gray castle, even the morning kingdom, many people have heard of the card. The name of Kim Fez. You are more and more outrageous!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In short, this thing is over here, understand?" Mey clap his hands. "Go back, go on film tomorrow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back At home, Carter also asked about the visit when chatting during dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and she took the matter with just a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the reason, Mayi does not want to involve her husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only a contradiction within the drama world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days, the magic filming was very smooth, and the low atmosphere she was worried about did not appear. On the contrary, it was probably because everyone was sighed with relief. In the end, the fragment of the final battle of the palace was particularly brilliant, and even Gat played a supernormal level, and never took a break without taking action. This atmosphere even led to the entire Star Flower Troupe, so that those who just entered the line did not take long to open their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who speculate that it will be because of the guidance of Master Kajin that the actors will suddenly work hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also made Mey a little relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the accident in the whistle hotel did not have much impact on the troupe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when she thought that the visit was over, something unexpected happened again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management of the Kajin Troupe took the initiative to find her after the day of shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My master wants to talk to you, Mey... No, Mrs. Lannis." He stayed outside the castle area and seemed to wait for a long time. The hat was covered with a thin layer of snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the other party is the founder of the Kajin Theatre Company, the master of the drama of the Grey Fort, Kajin Fiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that moment, she had a lot of doubts in her heart, and even wanted to use the "disappointment" in the other party to refuse to go back, but she found that she really wanted to see Kajin. One side...not for anything else, just to solve the mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I bring a partner?" Mey asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you can only allow you to go to Kajin." The manager shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mei sister..." Irene, who is peering, is worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Eileen and pointed out that she had no problem, then took a deep breath. "I understand, please lead the way."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remains a whistle hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei followed the management to the second floor and entered a spacious study. Standing against the bookcase, there are several well-known faces - "Princess" Roentgen, "The Prosperity of the Prosperity", Ai Gepo, "Fei Xia" Benis... These are the top actors who come from all over the place. In "The Prince's Love Story", she also had a fairly harmonious cooperation with them. The reunion after many years should have been full of joy, but from the indifference of the other side, Mey only saw contempt and hostility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can't help but surprise her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no hope for reunion, but in the impression of the Star of the West, even if there is a contradiction between each other, it will not be so obvious. For famous actors, hiding expressions is just a basic skill. Even if they are facing a new person, few people are willing to completely tear their faces. This is different from the good things of the Long Opera House. The more famous people, the more they are. Cherish your own wings. However, they are not willing to do this kind of surface work at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei looked at the desk behind the half-headed white-haired old man, not seen for years, Kajin seems to be a lot older, but the actors present are no one Will ignore his existence. These peers have never spoken, and it is obviously waiting for the master of the drama to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carkin likes to feel her gaze, close the script in her hand and stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
