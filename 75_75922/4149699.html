			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Air Knight Academy, in the flight field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumble of the engine broke the silence of the dawn, and the ten biplanes slid into the hangar in turn against the morning light. The slender wing was plated with a finely-cut gold rim under the soft radiance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you intend to bring the preparatory students together?" Roland stood next to the boarding gate of the Seagull and asked Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly nodded. "If it goes well, I can finish the last part of the flight manual in a month, but I don't want the students to waste a month. Theory Wherever you can teach, there may be opportunities to fly to the front line - after all, the airport is already a big rear compared to the position of the First Army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s true that it’s true... It seems that she hasn’t forgotten her identity as a dean. Roland is a little relieved. “Give the trainees a chance to get started. Don’t dominate the plane all the time. It’s the primary purpose to teach everyone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, what he wants to say is, don't go ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many opportunities for revenge, don't rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Tilly glanced at him. "Alright, as long as you give me a good machine, I promise not to grab the students." Skyfire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolandton time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his unspeakable appearance, Tilly chuckled, and she placed the scattered hair in front of her forehead. "Do not worry, I know you." The idea in my heart. If you want to make an appointment, one month later I will bring out a team of empty knights who can actually fight, and you will make a special machine - before that, I promise not to be hard with the enemy, how?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s best not to be hard in the future—although Roland thinks so, he understands that war can’t always be smooth, and that an army that can win adversity is eligible to win. So in the end he nodded, "pay attention to safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I am still waiting for the day you bring back to the ashes, brother." Yan Yan smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, her smile blended with the distant dawn, and it was deeply reflected in Roland’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, the time to take off is here," the guard reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I am leaving." Tilly turned and climbed the ladder and got into the hatch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm..." Roland walked out of the runway one step at a time. Although he had already had a farewell party last night, he still had some disappointment. Through the porthole, he saw many witches waving goodbye to themselves at the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty, Andrea, Sylvie, Echo, Leaf... Like the last expedition to Takira, they will travel to a new battlefield However, the situation to be faced this time will be even more daunting and the time will be longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone will come back safely," said the nightingale. "I have this kind of hunch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Roland nodded and did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The runway is empty and ready to take off!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Indicator flag, all green!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the ground guides waving their arms, lightning is the first to vacate Then, it is the wheat stalk that turns into a beastly beast. In the absence of navigation and the first time to go to a strange place, the two will assume the orientation of the entire fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also noticed that the Thunder was holding a pipe and waving goodbye to his daughter in the crowd, his face full of pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following is the Seagull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks extraordinarily light and smart compared to the noisy biplane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is the Witch Alliance or the Sleeping Curse, most people's hearts are tied to this plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the magic wind blowing, the Seagull only slid for a short distance and then looked up and left the runway, and climbed slowly into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is the empty knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten two-wing aircraft is now all the air power of the winter city, six of which are still without the "training machine" of the weapon system, but Roland is clear, the factory A new batch of bodies is being assembled intensively. As long as it takes time, these artificially large-scale artificial birds will surely hit the devil and provide a safe air defense barrier for the first army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Skyfire ran across the runway one by one, rising at the end of the wall and lining up into a column that disappeared into the skyline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to enable the empty knight to quickly enter the battle, Roland’s engineering team is in the process of road construction, along with the glow of Chishui City, Yong Night City, and neighboring countries. The city and the thorny town have opened up a landing field. They will serve as a springboard for connecting the North and the South, providing fuel replenishment and landing for the transition aircraft. For a two-wing aircraft with an empty weight of less than one ton, as long as it is a flat open space, it is enough to meet the take-off and landing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pilot is skilled enough, the plane departing from the winter city in the early morning will be able to cross the gray fort and the morning and the morning before the sun sets, reaching the wolf heart. In this era, it can definitely be called speed. This is why Roland is so focused on the Air Force - once it is formed, human support and offensive efficiency will rise to an unprecedented level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, as the first long-distance flight in history, Tilly has reserved ample margin. According to her plan, the whole team will spend the night in Yongyue City and go to the cage mountain the next morning, so that even if there is an accident, the entire voyage can be completed during the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the flight team that supported the front line disappeared for a long time, everyone still looked at the sky in the north and did not want to disperse for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is also true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is looking forward to this force to open a new situation for the First Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; actually really...flying up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manfred stunned and looked at the behemoths one by one in the clouds, excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, what are you doing there? It’s the turn of our class to board the ship," someone shouted behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, I will pass." He slammed his head and let himself return from the shock and turned to rush to the team. Even then, the reverberation in his mind is still the roar of the iron bird when he rushed past him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this month, Manfred has fully realized the incredible thing without the winter city, but for the first time, he witnessed the whole process of skyrocketing. Still let his mood rise to the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, in addition to the simple shock, there are some other feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at first glance, he fell in love with the job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated by the placement officer Matt, Manfred successfully passed the questioning audit conducted by the Personnel Department of the Executive Office and received no winter. Resident ID card and a house of their own. It can be said that he did not encounter any obstacles in the early stage of integration, and he had a foothold in the new city in a short time. Whether it is the paperwork of the Executive Office or the policeman who is fair to the public like Sheron, it is a promising choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he hesitated and repeatedly submitted his application to the Air Knight Academy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Manfred is told that a qualified air knight will be part of the army, not only will it be subject to more rigorous scrutiny, but it may also be sacrificed in war. He also did not change his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
