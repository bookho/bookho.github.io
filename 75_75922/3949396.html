			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland rushed to the laboratory next to the Chishui River and found that the damage was not as serious as he thought, at least the main room for acid refining was unscathed, while The window glass between the two was shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord Lord, please save our mentor! He is very hurt, he is going to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Roland appear, a group of disciples immediately came around, but was quickly stopped by the guards. Roland waved his hand and motioned everyone not to be anxious. "Where is the other person? Let me see it first." Then he turned back and whispered to Carter, "Nanava?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I have sent someone to ask, it is estimated that I will arrive soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded and entered the lab under the protection of the guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cemo Stoll is lying on the ground, leaving a little bit of blood on the ground, extending to the side, probably being dragged from the accident to the main house Come in. His face is blurred, blood and pus are mixed together, and should be caused by the strong acid splashed during the explosion. On the hand, there are fewer fingers, and the white phalanx can be seen through the flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apprentices have already done an emergency response, and they can see that they have encountered similar things when they were in Chishui City, taking people out of danger, tying them to stop bleeding, Seeking help... These measures are quite in place. However, this kind of injury is usually treated with herbs and self-healing methods. Ten of them have not been saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland ordered the guards to hold the door, waiting for the arrival of Nana, and he and Carter walked into the side, trying to find the finger of the chief alchemist. Otherwise, even if the little girl cured his injury, he could not conduct another chemical experiment - this is definitely a major loss for Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like being swept away by the wind,” Carter said, holding his nose. “There is still a bad smell.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the taste of nitrogen dioxide." Roland scanned the small room for a week, the window has all been opened, the possibility of poisoning is not big, at most only a little residue. The glass bottle on the test bench was broken, and the sour water flowed down the table and gathered on the ground to form a water stain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember to use tools when rummaging, don't touch them directly with your hands," the prince shouted. "There are gloves in the cupboard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the evolution of Soloya’s abilities, he has sent more than a dozen pairs of anti-corrosion ultra-thin gloves to the laboratory, but it’s clear that the alchemists’ current horrors are Tested with gloves. If you wear gloves, the explosion will blow off his fingers, at least you can leave the broken fingers inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the locker above the test bench, something caught Roland’s attention. After he took down the strangely shaped bottle, he discovered that it turned out to be a liquor sold in the convenience market - and that the wine was still drunk a lot, leaving only a small bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cemo actually brought liquor into the lab? It's hard to imagine an experienced chief alchemist drinking during the trial! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, Miss Nanava is coming," the pro-healer reported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, continue to keep the door, don't let the apprentices enter," leaving Carter to continue to look for broken fingers in a pile of glass slag, Roland first returned to the experiment Room master room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it him?" For Nana Va, this level of treatment is commonplace, scared to see blood before encountering The little girl who will faint in the wounds of the deaf, now she has grown a lot - whether it is ability or courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First cure the corrosion wound on his face," Roland nodded. "Carter is looking for his broken finger, and you will pick it up later." "That's fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Nana Wah smiled. "I can cure this small injury now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland groaned, only to see her put her hands on the chest of the alchemist, close her eyes, and the injury of Kaimo changed immediately - the face will be healed in a short while, and The broken finger actually began to stretch outward, which is a lot slower. First the bones, then the flesh, and finally the nails and hair. After about a quarter of an hour, his fingers were completely restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
