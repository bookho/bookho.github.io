			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa has been waiting in the inner city hotel for these days, anxiously waiting for the reply from Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The towering inner wall divides the king into two different worlds, and strict regulations are imposed on the entry and exit. Both aristocrats and wealthy businessmen need small at the entrance. A thorough examination is performed in the room, and if there are signs of onset, such as fever, flushing, and dark spots, they will not be allowed to enter. After leaving the inner city, you must rush back in the evening of the day, otherwise the sun will fall and the city gate will be locked out, you can only spend the night outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this still does not stop the spread of the plague. Yesterday he has heard rumors that the nobles in the inner city were infected. If the church did not finally release the first sacred drugs, I am afraid The nobles will collectively withdraw from the kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sixth day after the letter was sent, the Margaret Chamber of Commerce finally came the news. He rushed to the appointed place, a tailor shop, and then was led into the basement by the clerk, and the owner of the chamber had already waited for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw Margaret sitting on a low table, and there was a basin of ice on the table, which was constantly bursting with cold. The sweaty Tassa walked to the opposite side of her face and sat down, suddenly felt a cool breeze rushing to the face, could not help but feel refreshed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Court asked me to give you a letter," she handed a folded envelope of sheepskin, and the lacquer at the seal looked intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa can’t wait to open it, take out the stationery – the brief description of the action plan, the news of the first army, and the tasks he needs to accomplish. After reading it carefully, he unobtrusively took the stationery into his arms and looked at Margaret. "Do you have any requirements for your Highness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, he just sent the letter to the messenger - of course, the express delivery is chargeable, I have already recorded it on the account."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cough, that's it," Tassa cleared his throat. "His Royal Highness needs to transport all the fugitives back to the West in a short period of time. Therefore, he hopes that you can provide a large number of vessels for uninterrupted transportation, not one. Two fleets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if they are infected?" Margaret guessed with great interest, "I think he is definitely not willing to take the entire West It became a dead place, so...had the temple found a cure for the evil epidemic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true," he nodded. "In fact, the first ship There were already patients on the team, but they didn’t break out until they arrived in the town. Now they are on their way back to Wangdu. All the crew members are safe and sound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Royal Highness of Roland is an incredible person, even the church has not come up with antidote so quickly," Margaret admired. "Do you want to spend a few days to transport the refugees? A week?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa stretched out three fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...Impossible!" The businesswoman took a moment and quickly shook her head. "Even if these people die halfway, there are still 5,000 people." Above, after three days of transportation, it means that I need to prepare nearly 100 sailboats. Even if the other shipping of the Chamber of Commerce stops and transports, it just happens to meet this number - but in this case, I may suffer thousands of losses. More than a golden dragon, and therefore lost customers can not count, even if the steam engine is free of charge can not offset this amount. So ... please forgive me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If everyone is sitting on the deck instead of lying in the cabin with the bed, the number of people a boat can carry can be doubled," Tassa insisted. "If you don't care, the two galleries that transport the ore are also You can take the passengers, as long as you open the hatch cover, you can load about 200 people at a time. Such a ship, your old friend Hogg should have a lot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "In Silver City, he does have several such big ships..." Marg It seems hesitant. "And according to your algorithm, you can probably reduce the number of ships to about 50. But... this is not a good deal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Tassa also thinks that if dozens of ships are to be gathered on the canal, it will take a lot of effort to dispatch and coordinate, and the cost of chartering is not all in their own pockets, but it is bothersome and laborious. Not much work, how can't be a good deal. At this point, he can only make the last move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
