			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jie Luo?" Roland asked tentatively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rolled her eyes, leaned over and placed the plate on the coffee table, then sat down cross-legged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing there, don't you have breakfast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the little girl is soft The young, slender, light-blue dress is a white stocking, and the ankle is almost the size of his own palm, and the madman who is screaming will never let go of himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since the other party did not deny the name, it is equivalent to acknowledging that she is Jieluo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do to kill her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this young girl’s figure can’t always be like a superb, can tear her own hands? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland first touched the kitchen, took a fruit knife from the knife holder and hid it at the waist, then slowly came to the coffee table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw only a piece of fried egg on my plate, and two fritters - well, one more than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer ring of the egg is golden in color, the skirt is slightly scorched, and the protein in the middle is slightly bulging, revealing a touch of orange, which is obviously a perfect flow of eggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo picked up the chopsticks and put a piece of fried egg into the mouth, then grabbed the fritter and smashed it up. "What did you do yesterday? What's on the ceiling?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... I think it's dirty, I want to wipe it." Roland randomly edited it. Reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" She looked up at the ceiling and said, "You won't rub it with a cloth hang on the clothes fork?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The effect is not good, but it is now clean," he coughed twice. "Is this what you did?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle, your head is okay," Jielu finally showed a look of worry. "Since I came here, aren't they all done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After coming here? Where are you before? Roland opened his mouth and eventually did not ask. Obviously, if you ask again, the other party will doubt his identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo quickly finished eating breakfast, handed him in front of him, "buy money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Ah?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dishes in the refrigerator are gone, I have to go to the market in the leeks today, how can I buy if I don't give money?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A junior high school student, actually knowing this? Roland touched his body subconsciously and didn't find the wallet. "Hey..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your bedside table, in the second drawer," Jie Luo sighed Tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to the bedroom, and he pulled out a dry wallet from the drawer, and opened it, there were only three hundred pieces in the room, and A few lottery tickets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much?" Roland returned to the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty, I can’t lift any more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland The idea of ​​spending someone else’s money is not heartbreaking, handing her a fifty-dollar bill. “More will be sold next time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jielu strangely I glanced at him and stuffed the money into his little purse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your hand..." Roland noticed two band-aids wrapped around each other's fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s no big deal when you smash the glass slag... Of course, it’s better if you don’t mess things up.” She shrugged, then Take your school bag and walk towards the gate. "I am going to school. I don't come back at noon. The bowl is for you to wash."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it is a tutorial," Jie Luo put on his shoes and poked half a head from behind the door. "Uncle, if you think your head is still hurting, go to the hospital and see if you don't do this stupid thing in the future." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After half a minute, Roland walked out of room 0825 and squatted down the aisle fence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of Jieluo soon appeared in his vision--white hair was always eye-catching, but the people who came and went seemed to be accustomed to it, no one turned back Look at her. She waited for a while downstairs until the other two yellow-haired hoes carrying school bags ran around and surrounded her, and the three talents disappeared into the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotions, she still made friends here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland licked his forehead, and this dream was too absurd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What to do next, do you want to follow her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not believe that Jielu can really virtualize a complete city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Roland turned and wanted to go back to the house to find the key, suddenly the whole body was stiff and the whole person was in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a pretty woman coming to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a light gray long hair, her brows are raised high, her lips and nose are similar, but she has a rejection of thousands of miles away. Cold and proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has never seen each other, but the memory of the four princes is clearly telling him that this person is his sister, the three kings of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garcia. Wimbledon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland subconsciously touches the fruit knife at the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's leave, don't block," the woman showed a disgusting expression, "I want to pass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You... don't know me?" He was amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," the other party sneered out. "Why should I know you? I dyed a hair of the same color as me, would you like to come close?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stared at her and slowly let go of the aisle. "You call Garcia, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "..." The woman's face is gloomy. "Although I don't know where you heard my name, I warn you that you will suffer if you are entangled." She stretched out her right hand and closed her fingers in turn, and the bones screamed. I feel like a fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she returned to her home and closed the door, Roland walked over and glanced at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room number is 0827, next door to the next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the security door that was lined up along the walkway farther away, he suddenly raised a horrified thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many households are there in this apartment building? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, the length of the public corridor is really amazing, standing at the door of the 27th room, the other end can not see the end! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thought is difficult to suppress once it rises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to the house as quickly as possible, turned to find the key, confirmed that he could open the door, locked the door lock, and then ran towards the increasing end of the room number go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promenade at the foot is no less than a straight runway of 400 meters long! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breathlessly came to the end of the corridor near the stairwell, and the last house number was 0899. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is incredible. Who will put nearly one hundred houses in the first floor of the building? According to the style of the 70s and 80s, a row of ten households is already a huge scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
