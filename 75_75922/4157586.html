Cerrosha looked at it for a moment, "If this male named Roland Wimbledon dies..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I probably will not exist anymore." Wajilis did not feel any heavy feeling in his tone, "but compared to the entire ethnic group, my personal destiny It’s not worth mentioning. If killing him can continue the race, you should never hesitate.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence did not follow this topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned to look at the noisy passage to the high-rises - not only humans, but also a few figures that resemble the ascending body, they shuttled The flow of people in the flow, and the integration of the surrounding, such a scene is incredible no matter how you look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, it re-requested, "Do you believe that male?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be honest, it's about the big thing about the survival of the people. I believe the word is too thin." Wajilis leaned over and leaned on the guardrail. "Even if the negotiator is you, I can't just act by faith. But he said It’s true that trust is the foundation of change – without this foundation, we may need decades or even hundreds of years to change the inherent notion of the war of divineity, which may far exceed the burden of the community. Ability. So it is not appropriate to answer yes or no."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "From the current point of view, he is really trying to end the battle of the gods. The changes in the war situation that tell me are not lying, and all aspects are integrated. This trust is not an excessive requirement. "The nightmare whispers, "There is no reason to doubt forever, the key lies in the trade-offs of the pros and cons."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weighing"... Silence repeated slightly, "What should I do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This depends You yourself... I said, you are already a qualified Maharaja, I don't want to influence your judgment too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After...I Can you only see you here?" Cerroshhi hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily." Wakiris shrugged. "I heard Roland say that he is trying to save a witch named Ash. If God makes If the information disclosed is correct, even if the body dies, as long as there is traces in the consciousness circle, it will still have a glimmer of life. I am at least much more complete than the witch who is floating in the sea of ​​consciousness. Right..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It said that it stretched out its hands and took off the other’s helmet. "Considering the risks, such a meeting will not be too much, so don’t pack it tightly. - I prefer to see your original look compared to dark armor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; When the two returned to the living room again, Roland could not help picking an eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has been known from the fish ball report that the silent disaster is very different when it is in peacetime, it will still be seen when you see it. A sense of accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was not prepared, it would be difficult for him to associate this burly armor with the "female" devil inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you finished talking? What is the conclusion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to ask a question, human. "Cerroshhi asked coldly, "If the battle of divineity is really a scam, how much do you have to grasp the victory over the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I I don't know." This is also a question that Roland often asks himself. "What is the god, what is its purpose, how should I fight, and even if there is a chance to fight, all are unknown. In terms of its current capabilities, we have no chance in theory. But I believe that no matter what the outcome, it is better to sit still."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a little bit Don't care about your life and death, but don't forget, Wakiris is still in your field of consciousness. For it -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also got Live well, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
