			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weapons are placed on both sides of the platform for the duel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sword to the whip stick, the common weapons are basically included, and the use of their own weapons is not allowed to ensure fairness as much as possible - for example, the big clan is fully capable of building A more sophisticated blade, and the challenger is basically in a poor and white situation, the quality of the usual weapons can be imagined, the gap is too large to make the duel lose its original meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Butram knows that this is not something that can be done without a hand, and the Iron Whip clan defeats the Aosha clan by stealing the black water long whip. . Although the arbitrators severely punished the weapon watchers afterwards, the failure of Aosha has settled down. No one will compete with the Tsang Clan of the Tieshan City for a broken clan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that nobody has expected that this trip will be a day when the dead will be reborn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of pressure, even the clan’s capital feels the pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the first time he saw the madness leader treating the new challenger with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a rule that a person can only bring a weapon?" The ash suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh... there is no such rule," Thuram returned. "As long as you can move back, you can get as much as you can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, I am ready." She first inserted two scimitars around her waist, and then grabbed a long-handled hammer in her hand and licked it. Finally, put on a square wooden shield. "These should be enough for me to use the duel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram swallowed, although he already knew this The hair of a black-haired goddess is infinite, but it is too far off the mark. The two-handed hammer that ordinary people have to use after years of training, she can actually hold it in one hand, and can easily swing like a fine sword. It is a nightmare for the enemy to encounter such an opponent. Apparently, in the conflict that happened in the pub, she did not make full efforts, otherwise it would be possible to empty the "skull glass". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me too," Andrea picked up the short bow and deliberately reduced the number of feather arrows in the arrow to twenty-two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So come on stage," said the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Thuram couldn't help but hold it. "You only have four people to participate in the duel?" He looked at the gray castle soldiers behind his eyes - five Ten people scattered around the arms frame, facing each other, staring vigilantly at other bystanders, and did not choose the weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sacred duel does not stipulate that the number must be the same, right?" Ashes don't care, "four people are enough."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the rules, the clan's participation in the duel should be between 15 and 30. This is in consideration of the restrictions set by the high-level venue, but there is also a rule that the number of challengers is not allowed. More than the challenged clan. In other words, if the other party only sent 15 people to fight, then Aosa can only play a maximum of fifteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This consideration is based on a cruel fact: no matter whether the duel is a win or a defeat, the warriors who play will face heavy losses, and more than half of the deaths and injuries are common. Even the battle to the last person happened occasionally. Obviously, the more people who invest in the duel, the greater the weakening of the clan's strength, so that the confrontation of sending 30 people to each other is relatively rare - unless you know in advance that the challenger can't make thirty strong warriors, this will be used. Ways to gain an overall strength advantage. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the number of the bone-cutting clan will be set at 22, which is undoubtedly a good intention to make a great impact on the clan even if the duel fails. Sliding from Tieshan City as a challenger does not mean complete annihilation. As long as there are brave warriors in the family, there is a chance to make a comeback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aosha’s correct approach should be to send the same number of people to fight against it, even though those gray-sburgers seem to be short and thin, completely unrecognizable, As long as there is ash, Aosa can still take a huge advantage - the power that is innate and unaffected by the stone of God, is enough to control the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the four people are completely different. The advantage of the goddess is to lead the people to survive in the cruel desert. It is the object of admiration, but not necessarily suitable. fighting. Moreover, the duelists will basically wear the stone of the gods, and the power of the goddess is easily suppressed and becomes weaker than the average person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
