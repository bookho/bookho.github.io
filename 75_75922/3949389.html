			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faceless person has quietly crossed the canal and swept past the mercenary camp before the sun completely settled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her real name is not called a faceless person, but Afra – this is the name given to her by Heather, the bishop of the holy city of Hermes. It means dust. She likes the name very much, because the dust is simple and unpretentious. As long as it falls on the ground, she can no longer distinguish each other, just like her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only in front of Heather, Afra will restore his original appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the arbitral tribunal, she assisted the bishop in dealing with many fallen people, including witches who rebelled from the church and those who were corrupted by the world. Being sent to the kingdom is to complete a key task: to transform a pious presiding judge into the King of the Grey Fort. As for the capture of the fallen witch, it is just a leisurely activity. She likes to imitate the witches who have been tortured and tortured. Then she will experience it from beginning to end and share the pain of the fallen person so that she can feel more deeply what she has done. The meaning of the matter is also the atonement for her possession of the power of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp of the other party is very cleverly placed, just in the field of the bulging shore, it is difficult to observe their whereabouts in the low places, and the witch flying in the sky Let her not dare to get too close. Afra has to lurk in a farm warehouse and wait until dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night shrouded the earth, she unexpectedly noticed a change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenaries have withdrawn from the dock area and have all been withdrawn from the camp, and the idiots of the dream waters are sparsely pulling up the torches and gathering together on the banks of the river - - This kind of battle is like telling the other party that "someone is coming to attack the camp." Even if there is no flying witch, as long as the mercenary group is not all blind, you can see that something is wrong at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops, her heart is not good, if the other party judges that the mouse is crowded, there is no chance of winning, it will definitely retreat to the east. Although it is very taboo to march at night, it is obvious that it is not enough to escape the life. Everything is good, and the encirclement is not even shadow at the moment. Dreamland water has just occupied the dock, and is still leaning against the few rafters on the shore. Cross the river slowly. When they come around, I am afraid that the other party has already run away. It is impossible to chase the enemy in the night to find the enemy. Where do you go to find the damn witches? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afra is rushing to the camp, hoping to get into the team before they retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when she arrived near the mercenary gathering place, the scene was completely unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still people around the camp patrolling, the campfire is very strong, the figures come and go, seemingly orderly, and there is no mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t even choose to retreat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After careful observation, Afula confirmed his judgment, and at the same time, he was happy. Although I don't know what the other party is considering, I decided to stay here instead of escaping as soon as possible, but the outcome is already doomed. She took a dagger from her waist and observed the action of the whistle-blower, touching the weakest position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to giving her the meaning of survival, Heather taught her techniques of fighting and assassination. The opponent is not an elite mercenary who has experienced many battles. It can be seen from the sentinel arrangement. As she watched a mercenary looking away from her, she quickly slammed into the back of her body from the corner of her eye, and covered her mouth with one hand, and stabbed her dagger into his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After quietly killing the mercenary, Afula held the other hand in one hand and put one hand on his chest to display the deformability - this is a Long and short process: When replacing the king, in order to ensure long-term effect, she almost exhausted all the magic in the body, and the conversion time lasted nearly half an hour. At this time, it does not need to be so laborious. In the blink of an eye, she turns herself into a mercenary. Although the effect can only last for half a day, it is enough for the assassination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the patrol had returned, she quickly dropped her clothes and put it on herself, while dragging the body into the wheat field. But in the face of the mercenary's weapons, she felt a little confused - it was an iron gun with a wooden handle, but the head did not have a gun tip, but a black hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this weapon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
