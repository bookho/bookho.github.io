			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wendy took a box of dinner and walked into the hospital, she was seeing Nanawa’s father, Tiguin Pine, talked to a man and a woman. Then the two bent over and bent, as if they wanted to kneel down, but they were stopped by the Tiguan Baron. Under a stalemate, the two had to smash a few shackles before they left in three steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they disappeared at the gate, Wendy curiously walked over and asked, "Who are they?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Who else, the parents of the devil." Tigud shrugged. "They don't trust the child to stay alone in the medical field and ask if she can take her home. But I know that let her stay here. After the meaning of His Majesty the King, he immediately changed his mouth. He also thanked his Majesty for his care." When he said the latter part of the sentence, he had some regrets and a pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty couldn’t help but laugh out, "Do you think anyone can be like you, dare to marry the castle of the lord for the daughter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows what the other person is regretting - probably in the eyes of the Baron, even if it is the request of her Majesty, she should not easily hand over her daughter. When Nana Wa was awakened, Tiguan was not prepared for the visit, and went directly to the castle of Roland. The four princes themselves were generous and kind, and they did not persecute the witches. Only then did the story become a beautiful talk. Otherwise, they would be replaced by the Duke of Ryan or the residence of the Western aristocrats. I am afraid that I would have to suffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this happened before Wendy arrived in Bianbu Town, she had already listened to the nightingale many times and naturally understood why the pride of Tigu came from . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are a lot better than Axia's parents." Wendy sighed as he thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is the daughter’s awakening as a witch. The only thing that Axia’s family thought of was the salary of that Golden Dragon. Not only did she eagerly send her daughter to the door, but also ordered She was responsive to her Majesty and the Witch Alliance, and completely regarded Asha as a sale of goods. If it is not for the sake of Jin Long directly handed over to them, it is estimated that this family will not allow Axia to return home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this very different attitude, when Axia and his sisters became familiar with each other, they gradually became accustomed to the free life living in the Witch Building, going back. The number has been decreasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a witch, she is lucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as a girl, her parents are giving up on her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also true," Tigu nodded. "They both worked in the kiln area, one was the construction team's handyman. Knowing this news, I ran over without eating rice. At least I could feel it from the look, they still care about the little devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to me There is no vaginal discharge in this box of dinner," Wendy smiled. "Can you take me to see Xuelun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, please come with me," Tigu touched his beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medical institution after the expansion has set the patient's residence in accordance with the requirements of His Majesty District, but very few people need to be hospitalized for treatment. Nana Va and Lily have almost all the conditions of the Winter City. Most patients just need to wait in the hall for a while to get away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Xuelun stayed in the hospital for the night was mainly to prevent accidents - after all, the influence of the church has not completely disappeared, and whether the immigrants from all over the gray castle have accepted The concept of "Witches and ordinary people can be friendly" is still unknown. But now, at least, Shelen no longer has to worry about being poisoned or homeless by her family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of a ward in the residential area, Tigu opened the door and yelled at the daughter at the bedside. "It’s time to eat, I will talk to my friends later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't eat together?" Nana Wad, then she saw Wendy, "Wenty Sister "You are here too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Wendy smiled and patted the lunch box. "I brought her dinner."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
