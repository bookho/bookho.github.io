			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoo stood on the fence of the bridge and overlooked the noisy crowd on the deck. The Roland was not big, and wanted to hold nearly a thousand people. Can only rely on strong plugging. The result is that everyone is squatting in the empty position, and there is no space left to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus most of the refugees went to the sea for the first time, the bumpy sea conditions caused them to quickly develop discomfort, dizziness and vomiting everywhere, and dense crowds It is even more intensified by this reaction - even if the body is better, when it is spit out, I can't help it for too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can’t help but be grateful, but fortunately, the body of God’s punishment can’t smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mortal is really fragile..." The sound of Carol suddenly came from behind him. "I can’t believe it, we used to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true." Zoe nodded with the same feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She naturally knows what the other person is referring to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the captain received the request for help, he immediately found them. Since the main task of the Roland is to determine the general orientation of the Shenshi vein, all actions are decided by Zoe. At that time, the ship was equipped with the magic core of underground civilization, and should avoid any accidents as much as possible. Moreover, the huge core skeleton occupied almost the entire rear deck, and even if it went, it could not transport many people. In the face of such a request, she should have refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In exchange for the era of the Confederation, the magical core that is extremely limited and cannot be copied will not be compared with the mortal. Not to mention the refugees, even if she chooses between a town and a core instrument, she will not hesitate, but now she is hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discussing with his companions for a while, Zoe made a decision that he even felt incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She unloaded the magic core in another temporary port town, entrusted the local first army unit to take care of it, and they returned to the pole with Roland. Beigang. She even explained to the garrison, if the ship did not return on time, they must return the instrument to the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it doesn't seem to be bad either." Carol shrugged with a smile. "To be honest, I think it's very likely that you will refuse. I still feel quite Tangled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope they can stand up to their expectations." Zoe deliberately coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What changed the minds of their peers? There are many fragments in her mind, the first army that fought with the devil in the ruins of the Holy City, the nurses who took care of her in the medical hospital, the ordinary people in the dream world and the witches, and Roland Wimbledon. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, don't mean we risked such a big risk back to the red fog area." Carol patted her shoulder and turned to The bridge went. "In any case, this mission was finally completed. I really want to go back to the winter city without thinking. When I think of the Sichuan-style hot pot in the dream world, my saliva will flow out..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕噜."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zou can’t help but roll the throat, but fortunately at this time The channel gate has been closed and no slight noise has been heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She puts aside distractions and looks at the red fog that is faintly visible in the distant horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty-hundred years ago, the battle of the gods that brought the endless nightmare of the federation finally came again. Even though the time was much earlier, the strength of the devil took place. The change, but her mood is calmer than expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, they are no longer alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Heikzod floated on a newly occupied city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no battlefield with no smoke or blood. Most of the buildings are in good condition, not at all like a sinister siege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one week, the ethnic army extended the front line to hundreds of miles and established an outpost at a place where life has not been covered. This process can be done so quickly, and it is inseparable from the help of human beings - listening to the reports, they only slightly threatened the lords and nobles, such as cutting off the heads of hundreds of people, the other side scared the courage, turned I started to raise the group to transport supplies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is exactly the same as the first battle of God. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that it has already spread the wind of the first city, and the wind has already spread. The other side is undoubtedly deeply aware of the end with the ethnic group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the expansion of the offensive, Heckzor also gradually got a lot of information from the human side. It doesn't quite understand why it was clear that during the federation, this race has been aggregated into a whole, and now it has once again become a sand. Only a corner of the land, actually divided into four kingdoms, each other is not the same, the union that originally ruled humanity is vanishing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past four hundred years, what exactly did they use for their time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that there is a lack of a powerful kingdom, it seems that this is not the case - after all, even the most talented genius generals are folded in human hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the other party not understand the power of unity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter what, Hecksod’s heart has been falling to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of accidents in the Western Frontline. In the end, it was successfully implemented according to the scheduled plan. The birth tower has been successfully activated. It has not lived up to the trust of the King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least compared to the empty bloody scorpion, and the only half of the mask can be said to speak, it fulfilled the promise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecksod returned to the collapse of the Split Ridge Mountains through a series of twisted doors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the base for the annexation of the last jigsaw puzzle, it has decided to name the city to be established as "Scorpio", just like its own title, here It must be remembered by the ethnic group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, the adjutant also sent a report on the advancement in other directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of the Scorpio quickly read through the results submitted by the various departments, and one detail caught its attention. The Yongdong Kingdom has experienced large-scale escapes everywhere, if only This is not surprising, after all, even if the general escape does not care for him, most vulnerable refugees will die on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this escape seems to be organized, premeditated, the direction is the wolf heart in the south, and it is the same. The team that wants to block them is not only incapable, but has been fiercely countered, and its performance is very similar to the enemy mentioned by Erskuk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although several of the troops led by the promoters have won, they want to completely stop them, relying on the existing staff is still very inadequate - this is also It is the choice to erect the tower of birth on the mountain. Without the assistance of the twisted door, the original body and the ascension body cannot rely on their own strength to enter the human territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It couldn’t help but frown. "What about the monarch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"大君阁I am still immersed in the floating pool, and there have been no signs of waking up recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, it’s almost ten days, this guy won’t be involved too Deep, swallowed by the conscious world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod summoned the door of twisting and stepped into the bottom of the rift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw that Wakiris remained in the initial silent position, sitting on the legs in the sparkling pool, the look on the face was natural, nothing The signs of struggle when swallowing, except for the long connection time, can't be seen at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that it still maintains a clear consciousness and swims in the sea of ​​consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other person is bloody, the Lord of Scorpio is only afraid of slap in the face. Forcing a break from the ideology will damage memory, but it is dispensable for the former, but it is a nightmare, but it does not dare to be so rash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
