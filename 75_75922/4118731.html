			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, finally let Miss Tilly write the Flight Manual. "Anna put down her books and said with a chuckle," Wendy won't feel badly hurt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Low will definitely have a little, but I Thinking about it should not be a big problem.” Roland moved up and moved himself to make himself more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you so sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The nightingale just advanced to me for the next month. Chaos drink, the book also applied for three ice cream roast rolls, accompanied by two of them, maybe one night to recover. And I also specially sent two bottles of fruit wine, it is a kind of comfort, drunk will not It will be a secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this wine a drunk dream?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, call Vanilla-flavored wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? It’s really normal..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every This time is always the most relaxing moment for Roland - after two people wash away the dust and fatigue of the day, lean on the soft black velvet pillows and share the trivial things they have experienced in the day. Usually, Anna will bring a travel or a biography, and look around before going to sleep, and one thing he likes to do is to look around and appreciate the soft and clean side face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the start of the fascinating forest railway line, this is also the time when two people can face each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every three days, she will take the train to the northwest, handle a leaf-laying track, and come back in the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a lot of work to do even without welding tracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, key components of some weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the replacement and improvement of new machine tools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glider's skeleton cutting and assembly is also inseparable from her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the industrial level of the West has been greatly developed compared to the original grassroots, basic metal materials and production tools have been witchcrafted, but no matter how Also can't keep up with the speed of Roland's design update. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this leisure is even more precious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it’s not bad to write the Flight Manual by Miss Tilly," Anna transferred the topic back to the test flight. "After all, what you end up wanting to make is For everyone to use, her feelings are closer to the average person. In addition, as far as learning ability is concerned, her knowledge is no longer under me, and it should be more helpful to you than Wendy."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... Wendy’s specialty is really not here,” Roland nodded. “I should have thought of this at the beginning.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, have you considered the machine for the new aircraft?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," he confidently Going back, "This is what I am best at. What's more, there is still a reference to the dream world. The prototype drawings can be fully in one step. Only after the oil fractionation tower is completed, you can try to start production."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people talked about the industrial problems of the winter city, from technical details to development All-inclusive plan - and not his personal stand-up comedy, Anna can not only understand his intentions, but also to express their views and praise just right, this confidant feeling really inspiring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the terrible proportion of men and women in the mechanical engineering institute, and not seeing the prospect of improving the hope of work, and then the girl’s eyelashes constantly slamming, he suddenly There is a kind of mechanical god who is blessing his feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably staring for a long time, Anna finally couldn’t help but scream. "Is my face so beautiful?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I knew you were like this. I should take action earlier." Anna smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it the night of the celebration after the end of the first demon month, the one that blocked him at the gate of the castle alone? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did you think I was like?" Roland couldn't help but be curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter how kind, it is also a famous prince. The apex of the nobility in the rumor is always different from us."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha...sorry, let you down," he regretted. "I am just an ordinary person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it's best..." Anna shook her head and cocked her back. "Because, I am also an ordinary person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** ****************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, it was wild. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main force of the First Army finally arrived at the pre-set bombardment position on the north slope according to the operational plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the iron axe is suspicious that this road is too smooth, not only did not anticipate the block, even the air harassment did not appear Once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had already made plans to step on the enemy’s body, but even the traces of the devil had not been seen in six days. The only battle was still encountered. A group of foraging wolves, in addition to the entire plain is in a quiet, as if all the monitors have been attracted by the sniper squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the case, but the feedback received from the witch is that this is not the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the devil also increased the patrol density in the first two or three days, and then withdrew most of the beasts, and the patrols of the outposts did not Recovery, can be said to give up monitoring of the area of ​​the film. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the camp, the iron axe immediately summoned the heads of the participating units and the staff to the central camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have any thoughts on the silence of the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a bit strange ..." Ai Gesha, the representative of the Witch Alliance trip, said in a moment, "There is only red fog that can limit their actions, but Sylvie said that the construction of the outpost has not stopped, at least the red line supply has not been interrupted."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If those nobles understand it well," Xiao Xiaochen said, "There is a problem with the rear, or it is a reluctance to detect this fearful beast." He looked at Ai Gesha. "Can Miss Sylvie see the movements in the ruins of Takira?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is too far from them," The latter shook his head. "The sniper squad had given up the enemies one day ago and was coming to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long will it take?" ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least four days," Ai Gesha glanced at the map. "The speed of the Magic Ark is not slow, but they are the opposite of the First Army. Road. Of course, if you just let lightning and wheat come, you can arrive this evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, we don't have to guess the enemy's intentions," Itis suddenly said, "No matter what they want to do, it is a godsend for us - no damage to the attacking position, the underground supply line is unimpeded, there is no better start than this. Let's just start the fortress gun and razed the devil's outpost to the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the results theory, this statement is beyond doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Axe thought for a moment, "If the magical Ark does not float out of the ground, it is almost impossible to be discovered by the devil, is it?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can think so." Ai Gesha replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So can you please bring Miss Sylvia with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
