			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, when the nightingale woke up, I found my hands tied back on a wooden stake, and the waist and feet were tied by a rope. . Trying to struggle, the body and the wooden poles are tightly attached together, and they are completely unable to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to use the ability, but the familiar feeling does not appear - her connection with the magic seems to be cut off. The nightingale bowed his head and found a transparent prismatic stone hanging around his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You wake up," Hakhara walked up to her. "How do you feel about petrochemical venom? Really, I have high hopes for you, nightingale. You have failed my expectations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The nightingale took a deep breath. "You actually have a lock of God's punishment, Hakala, Do you know what you are doing? The shackles used by the church to suppress the witches are now being used by their mentor to deal with her kind! What made her even more annoyed was that the crowds around the scene looked ugly and did not seem to feel that there was anything wrong with this. Damn, the nightingale shouts in the bottom of my heart. Don’t you find that you are becoming the kind of person that the witch once hated? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A tool, and occasionally there are some bad children who can't listen to the teachings need to be punished." Hakhara did not care, "And you, nightingale, is The person who needs to be punished. Or... Should I call you Veronica? A family born in a noble family, but fell into a witch, still thinking about climbing a high woman?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand what you are talking about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You let me down, when Wendy took you from the aristocratic clutches When I was rescued, I thought that you would stand firmly on the side of the co-help club. See what you have done now, just when everyone is about to find the holy mountain, you want to make this great situation fall short!” Hakhara shakes his head. He laughed, "Take your sisters to go to a prince? If you have been kept in captivity for too long, servility is already ingrained. You have to find yourself a master to know how to live. Or... you just want to put them all. Sold out to the nobility, in exchange for your former status!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "All I did was to help the sisters of the meeting," the nightingale forced the anger, and it was meaningless to break the mouth. "I hope they don't have to be ravaged by the awakening day, I hope they can live." I don’t want to block your plan, sisters should have the right to choose their own way of life. Bianque Town is undergoing earth-shaking changes, and the steam engine drawings I bring are one of them. It's working, and it's endless. With this kind of machine, you can hang water directly from the mountain, without having to run around for it every day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ha Kara sneered twice. "What are you talking about?" She turned and pulled a stack of parchment rolls from a witch behind her and raised her face in front of the nightingale. "I don't understand the above. What, but a bunch of cold iron pieces pieced together can be autonomous activities like a living? You are all three-year-old children!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went Before the brazier, throw the paper roll into the burning charcoal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No!" The nightingale shouted in vain, watching the design as a ashes in the brazier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My patience has been exhausted, now gives you a last chance," Hakhara pulled an iron vertebra from the brazier, and the front end of the iron vertebra was burnt red. "If you plead guilty to all the sisters of the Communist Youth League and admit that you have been tempted by the nobility, I can spare you a life, but the whipping is inevitable. This is the lesson you believe in the enemy. If you still obsessed, I have to use this. The root iron vertebra pierces your heart and nails your body on the stake so that everyone can take it as a warning." She said one word at a time, "Don't miss my last kindness and say your decision." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night look at a little iron close to his own iron, and even feel the scorching heat from the tip of the cone. If it was the weak self before, I am afraid I have bowed my head and admit it wrong? But she has bid farewell to the past, no longer the timid girl. She is a nightingale, a powerful witch, and death can't make her surrender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She closes her eyes and waits for the last moment. I don't know why, Roland's figure appeared in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" someone shouted, she squinted and opened her eyes. I saw Wendy coming out of the crowd and said to Hakala: "Teacher, look at the white cloth wrapped around your arm. We have experienced so many separations. Do you want to add another one?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
