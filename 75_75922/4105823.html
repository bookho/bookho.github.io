			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the conference hall, Wendy retelled the newly acquired information from beginning to end. When it comes to safe distance, Elsie is unceremoniously playing. Broke her words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In front of the devil, there is no real safe distance - Tajira understands this after paying a heavy price, drawing with red fog consumption Determining the war zone is extremely dangerous. For example, a beast can carry a number of gas tanks, so that the raid distance is greatly increased; or a batch of gas tanks can be buried in advance, and then replaced in the march. Of course, the most direct means is to establish The outposts, and these sites as a springboard, to obtain a longer range of offensive, the battle around the outpost is the main tone of the whole battle of God, but unfortunately we can hardly find all the secret whistle on the vast plains Don't forget, the devil is more cunning than you think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty couldn’t help but imagine the scene depicted in the other side: the overwhelming devil army launched On the front of the storm, while setting up an outpost that can store red fog, once completed, the area will soon be occupied by a steady stream of devils, and the federation will lose the corresponding intelligence and resource supply. The surrounding area is also in jeopardy. In the end, it is like snowballing. The more land that is lost, the more difficult it is to move until it is no longer able to resist the devil's attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How much do you think they have a chance to attack without a winter city?" Tilly asked calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to say that you are lucky - or that we are very lucky," Els said with a whisky. "Although the red fog cannot judge the enemy." The limits of the range, but at least can judge their intention to act. In a short period of time, I think the devil is unlikely to launch a large-scale attack on the Winter City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;“Can you elaborate?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s still red fog.” The ancient witch ordered a sarcoma head. “All actions of the devil depend on the red fog. The transport, sinking into the ground means that the supplies they can use are not sufficient, leaving only the patrols instead of building the camp, and this is also proved from the side. Even if the devil attacks the border, it should be only a sporadic force. Of course, There will be no changes in the follow-up situation, and it will be judged according to the situation on the spot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly moved her eyes to Pasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aer’s judgment is credible," the latter placed the Lord’s sire. "In the federation era, she led the sacred team I have won many surprise attacks on the Devil Camp... but the temper is not very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My patience is only used for things that deserve attention," Elsie didn't have a good air. "I am more worried about the new war machines than the long-range raids of the beasts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to ask . . . How did the devil used to transport the red fog?” Barov finally found a chance to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like us," Pasha sighed. "A mixture of low-level devils, trailers, slaves, or a modified siege. They The time to plan a war is also close to us. Whenever the war is approaching, there will always be more than a dozen red lines on the fertile plains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to block transportation The red fog, whether it is the holy army or the ordinary fighting witch, or even the mortal army, must go all out. If you encounter a well-guarded transportation team, the blood we shed will often dye the whole road, so those red lines It is both the blood of the devil and our life and death line," added Elkh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence made the atmosphere of the scene somewhat solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they have not officially played against the devil army, everyone feels the pressure exerted by this powerful alien on humanity more than 400 years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the influence of Roland, even Wendy knows the importance of logistics, and transportation is undoubtedly the standard for measuring its level. If the devil has the ability to make such a huge device to deliver red fog, it means they can use fewer teams to provide a lot of supplies to the front line. The reduction of the blood line will make the guards of each transport team more strict. Perhaps the scene that Luo Jia sees will become the normal state of the devil's advancement in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not Roland Wimbledon, she really doesn’t know how to fight for the fourth battle of God – the devil has been here for centuries There may have been earth-shaking changes. The high-level devils and the huge unparalleled skeleton monsters acting alone are proofs; except for the absence of the winter city, the power of other human kingdoms is much weaker than that of the Confederate era, letting those noble knights She did not dare to think about this scene without fear of rushing to the devil army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
