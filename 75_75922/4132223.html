			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Anna walked into the underground temporary headquarters, the atmosphere in the room looked quite heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing her arrival, everyone stood up and bowed to her, "I have seen His Royal Highness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe is a one-knee squat, "Let you be scared. I couldn't see the enemy's tricks, and I was beaten up by the devil. This is a subordinate job. It's really sorry." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to be like this," Anna said, "I think it's just like an ordinary person who cares about war. I just came over and asked about the situation, this attack... ...is everyone okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she became a queen, she still has some difficulties in dealing with such occasions, especially seeing Wendy and Ai Ge Sha and others also pay tribute to her. Although she never mentioned it in the past, she rarely expressed her thoughts in front of the witch, but actually liked the feeling of sister-like in the league. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the camp was attacked the same - compared to the beginning of the battle, she was sent to the underground bunker by the god witch and the guard She hopes to fight with everyone, just like the previous demons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Anna knows that since accepting this identity, some things can only be taken into the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She only hopes that her appearance will make everyone feel at ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe hesitated in a rare way. "His Highness, the situation is not very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, we are just discussing this issue." He looked to film. Sirte, who nodded , open the notebook in your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The current medical team reported statistical results, the first army in the night attack more than two hundred people died in battle, nearly seven hundred people were injured." Xiao Xiaochen Shen channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But due to limited time, this is only the most rough statistics, and the actual casualty number will definitely rise further. After all, Miss Nanawa, she can't take it into consideration. More injuries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hundred people - this is the loss after the church battle. And that is a decisive battle about the fate of both sides. This is only the first battle after the Northern Expedition. The first army is still a long way from the ruins of Takira. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that the iron axe has a hard time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annan has seen the scene in the wounded battalion, the soldiers with bloodstains lined up on the ground, the air is full of thick blood and smell. Absolute pain. With the magic of Nana Va, it is impossible to cure all the wounded in one breath, such as a severely wounded person with broken limbs and visceral rupture. He recovered five or six at most. Therefore, in order to treat more people, you must save the magic and use it in the most critical parts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if the chest and lungs are pierced and the intestines are scratched, only the deadly wounds on the organs will be healed. The problem is not so serious. The medical team is responsible for suturing the epidermis after the purified water is poured; if it is serious, the wound will continue to open and wait until the next day for further treatment. During this time, the medicines prepared by sleeping pills and winter flowers make the seriously injured people suffer from severe pain. As for whether everyone can get to the next day, or the drug may have an addiction similar to dream water, It is no longer a problem that the medical team can care for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a repressive environment, it is not an easy task to accurately assign the magic to the areas that are in urgent need of treatment. It's hard to imagine that the little girl who used to read and read with her and see dizziness when she saw the blood has grown to this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will make a statement to Roland, as much as possible to convince Ms. Speyer of the Dragon Ridge to support the front line," Anna replied slowly. "There is her If so, the medical team can save more people. Right, how is the devil quietly approaching the camp?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think... The enemy should be a blind spot that uses the magic eye.” Sylvie looked a little frustrated. “I was afraid that I was only trying to detect my investigation before I sent the beast detection, and I didn’t realize it at all...”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That said, it is not who's wrong." Xiao Xiaochen light comforted, "I want to blind the enemy, unless I deliberately turn a blind eye to the apprehension of the beast. But this itself is contrary to the usual training, even if the enemy is known in advance. To do this, it is also difficult for thousands of soldiers and more ordinary workers to pretend to be seamless. In other words, the enemy will try this distance sooner or later, even if it is not set up at Tower No. 1, it will be in Tower No. 2. "Tower 3 is waiting for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I remember correctly, the spider's range should be about two to three kilometers, and the crawling speed is slow. The time from Sylvie’s field of vision to the range is not too short. Isn’t it just because of luck?” Anna said, “I don’t know much about the fighting in the march. If there is If you make a mistake, please don't mind - the First Army has its own means of investigation? For example, the hydrogen balloon that is often raised in the camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your observation is really meticulous, Your Highness." Iron “When it’s said, the first military’s wartime intelligence source is divided into three layers. Except for Silvi, Lightning, and Miss Mai, the last layer is the army itself. But in the face of the devil, this The first layer can only be used as a supplement and emergency."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the explanation of the chief commander, Anna finally had a basic understanding of the first army’s intelligence system. To understanding. In the battle of the unified gray castle kingdom, there was no flaw in this system. After the opponent was replaced by the devil, an irreparable gap was placed in front of the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, whether it is two legs or four legs, they run without a pair of wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that once there is more than one distance, the investigators basically have no return, let alone return the news, and even save their lives is a luxury. The fearful beast that can be hidden in the clouds has an absolute advantage, and the flat terrain of the fertile plains is almost like an eagle hunting chick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has caused the third layer of intelligence to be greatly compressed, even the auxiliary Sylvie can not do it - the flying devil can enter the magic eye at any time The scope of investigation, hunting those soldiers in the outer circle, and their own no rescue ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An expression in Anna’s mind involuntarily emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Roland often mentioned, and will show the words of complex look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Air Control Rights". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Only the party with the air power can truly grasp the initiative of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, he will also say something that is unclear, such as black ribbon, autumn mountain or something...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna shook her head and pressed these thoughts down. "If you follow this explanation, the spider must have entered the warning level of the third floor. Is it because of the night?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The poor view of night is just one of the reasons, Your Highness," answered her by film. Silt, "According to the after-the-fact analysis of the staff... those deformed monsters, I am afraid I was there waiting for us at the beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anna blinked in surprise. "You mean... they were buried in front of our route beforehand." "Underground?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, that's the way to explain why those giants are almost silently in the range." The face was dignified. "I asked Miss Sylvie, the glimpse of obstacles will increase the consumption of magic, and The encirclement will also be greatly reduced. Now think about it, in addition to the temptations, those beasts are also attracting the attention of Miss Sylvie - as long as the sky is constantly monitored, there is no magic to take into account the changes under the ground."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So can the devil hit the corners of the camp so accurately in the night? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is still to rest, the difficulty will indeed drop a lot, and the shady scene that Sylvie sees should not be concealing the orientation, but concealing the spider. The moment the magic climbed out of the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy not only responds quickly to the first army’s means of warfare and intentions, but also is extremely proficient in the use of magic power. When he thinks of fighting such an opponent, he does People feel very tricky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
