			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stood on the wall and looked at the north. This month, he repeated the three-point line of castles, mines, and walls to check every detail that might be forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The militia’s spurs are becoming more and more sophisticated. They have been able to hold the guns under Carter’s repeated drills until the hunter in charge of the attack screams the attack slogan. Only sent a long gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing behind them is the Orion team, and all the hunters who stay in Bianbu Town and are good at using bows and bows are incorporated into this team. These experienced hunters are the main force in killing evil beasts. They shoot at the corner of the 12-foot-high wall, and there is almost no possibility of shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is a team of iron knives, Carter and two other elite hunters. The blacksmith shop built the parts, and the four rear-mounted rifle guns assembled by Anna were delivered. They were only killed by the patch team when they encountered a tricky monster or a mixed kind of evil beast that could not penetrate the outer skin. Their position is very free. They walk up about 200 meters long and appear where they need it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the explosives package, it is stored in the next guarded warehouse of the city wall. When you need to save the field, you can transport it to the city wall separately. After all, this thing may cause damage to yourself. It may be bigger than the evil beast. The teeth of the evil beast cannot bite the cement stone, but the explosive can make the whole wall. Send it to heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, Roland has organized two practical exercises, including the use of explosives packages. Thanks to these two drills, the official defensive wartime militiamen were stunned by the screaming of explosives and the fear of throwing away their weapons. Another advantage is that when everyone finds that the prince still holds such a powerful weapon, the morale of the team suddenly rises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness," Barov tightened his collar. "The income of the ore trading has spent most of it, if the demon moon is really like the astrologer said It’s long, I don’t think it’s going to end in winter.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There will be all the stuff in my vault,” Roland said without hesitation. The transaction in Liuye Town should not stop. The steaming machine has been transported to the mine, and the cleaning work of the collapsed gravel is basically completed. We can still get a little production in the whole winter. Especially the original stone, no need to emphasize the price, can Quickly sell as soon as possible. It is always right to store more food and dried meat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barov nodded, "I will do it, Your Highness Just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the assistant’s assistant’s words and words, Roland certainly understands what he wants to say. “Reassure, I arranged a boat. If I really get to the situation, I will leave the town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I will rest assured "Barov relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland smiled at him. "You are going to be busy with you. I will look at it alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Barov left, the prince slowly climbed onto the watchtower. This is the highest point in the center of the city wall, from which you can overlook the vast jungle and rolling hills ahead. The cold wind whistled, but he didn't care. Only on this empty high platform, he will calm down when he faces the tension in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are lying to him," someone said, "You have no intention of leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Life is already so difficult, some things are still not to be dismantled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand what you are talking about, if the prince's identity is counted Difficult, then what are we?" The nightingale showed up in shape. "Even if you don't become a king, as long as you have lived through the five years of the king's order, you are also the master of the party. Compared to worrying about this, you still spend more time with Anna. Ok, I’m afraid... she didn’t have much time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was silent for a moment, “I don’t think she can live without the demon moon.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She said she would not lose to the demon phagosome," he paused. I believe in her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You actually believe in a witch," the nightingale shook his head. "We are cursed by the devil."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian dressed in casual clothes, standing in front of the gray dog's tombstone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently stroked the new stone tablet, and the pure white monument was engraved with a line: "No name, but a long-lasting heart. A hero who sacrificed for Bianbu Town." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Greyhound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I realized my dream, until the end of the demon month The Four Princes will hold a book for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I don't want to sit in the hospital bed."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My wound has healed, and the wall is where I should be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The demon moon is coming, the evil beast It may be terrible, but they will hit the defense line that everyone is working together to build. You can't take it one step further."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will even share your share To guard the town, wield a long sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The person who framed you is still alive... but he won't live forever This is my promise to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will bring good news the next time I will meet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian bends down and puts a bouquet in front of the tombstone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So goodbye, my friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;******** ***********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "An older sister, are you not afraid?" Nana Wa, asked on the bed with her calf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you afraid of?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The demon pharynx. Nightingale is winter, I It’s the first time this year is the witch..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first time," Anna thought, "It will hurt, sometimes You can't even wait to die right away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" Nanawa exclaimed and immediately grabbed her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you will survive, just like me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know... "Nanawa whispered, "I am not as strong as you are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not so strong," Anna closed her eyes and emerged in her mind. The scene when I first met Roland. In the dark and damp dungeon, he put his clothes on himself and whispered to hire himself - until now, she still felt incredible. "You will also encounter something that makes you want to live, even if it is Struggling to live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, covered with sauce The steak," she sighed. "How do I know what you want - eh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at his own Nana, Anna Wiping his face with your hand, "Is there something dirty on my face?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...," the latter shook his head. "I was just a little surprised." You never said so much to me before... Anna Sister, you just closed your eyes and thought, so beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna turned over With a white eye, jump out of bed and walk to the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa followed. "What are you looking at, hiding in the forest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The forest is on the west side," Anna said. "You can only see the Chishui River."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
