			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lie sings," After Roland finished the operation of the alchemist, when he returned to the office again, the night sang, "What four hundred and fifty years ago? Ancient books, "Elementary Chemistry" is not a textbook that you wrote to the memory of the book? Will that thing be taught to the people sooner or later?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good faith lies However, Roland took the cup and drank the tea. Since the Wangdu merchant Margaret gave a bag of black tea, he can finally bid farewell to the day of drinking boiled water or ale. "How can a prince in the palace? I know very well about alchemy, and if so, it is also the teaching from the Wangdu Alchemist. Giving him a textbook to study on his own is easier to accept than the alchemy that I teach. After all, people will always believe in themselves." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢?" The nightingale suddenly leaned down and leaned over to Roland. "Who is your knowledge, who is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Roland just opened his mouth and was pressed by his finger at night. "You say you do not want, do not speak out I do not want to hear that you lied.." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; he blinked, the other was hand back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are five days left before the test," Roland took the opportunity to change the subject. "You have to let Carter know the operation of the new weapon in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you are not saying that the ammunition problem has not been resolved yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fire cotton only affects it The actual use of the gun. If only for the test, each gun can still be fired. After all, there is no need to consider transporting bullets and repeated loading, and ten bullets are enough to get results," Roland said. Of course, the lack of firing rate caused by the lack of fire cotton is a probabilistic event, which can only be decided by God and Carter's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp West of the town wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter came to the previous explosives test site and accepted Roland’s new assignment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War with a witch?" The chief knight groaned, "Can I wear the stone of God?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," Roland smiled. "But you are faced with a special witch. The stone of God's punishment is not valid for her. Her style of war is similar to that of a warrior. She attacks with a big sword. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean, she is a witch who is proficient in close combat?" Carter glanced at the nightingale around Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost, but because her ability is to strengthen herself, both strength and speed are far superior to ordinary people." Roland said, "You must be mentally prepared." Probably the physical fitness of the opponent is several times higher than the death penalty used to test the pills."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Higher times...His Highness, you know that What does it mean?” Carter widened his eyes. “It’s very likely that even if I observed her movements, my body couldn’t keep up with the reaction. If she was as powerful as you said, I’m afraid I couldn’t beat her.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In theory, your winning percentage is really zero," the prince handed over a strange firearm. "But with this, your chances of winning will be greatly improved." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...new musket?" Carter took it with both hands - because its trigger and barrel parts were very similar to the rifle, the Cavaliers judged They should belong to the same weapon. It is not big, but it is heavy in the hand, and it is a bit more than a rifle. What is particularly striking is that, except for the wood at the grip, the entire gun body is made of metal, and the smooth lines and corners, as well as the grayish metallic luster, have an indescribable beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter liked this weapon almost instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's called a revolver," Roland pulled out another weapon of the same shape, and left the wheel like a hive to the left. "Now I teach How do you use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter soon discovered that it is easier to operate than a rifle, and that the projectile and gunpowder have been integrated into one The runner can fire. There are five holes in the runner, which can be loaded with five rounds of ammunition at a time, which is probably why it is called a revolver. There is a small hole in the tail of the pistol corresponding to the runner. As soon as the trigger is pulled, Mars will shoot out from the hole and make a squeaking noise. Perhaps there is a piece of meteorite inside, he thought. However, the bullet design is too subtle. The pale yellow casing is probably made of a thin copper plate. The overall appearance is perfectly round, and the whole body is smooth, and there is no trace of the joint gap. The bullet is thick and thick before, and the tail is about the thickness of the index finger. It can fit the hole of the nest with great precision. How is this made? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
