			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that really good?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let Effie and Yu Yu and Lian Yang go to the town," the ash sat behind and sat Tilly in front of the desk, "Is Hert Morgan's request to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the "sea line" exists, the five kings are almost daily They all immersed themselves in the study, and piled up books that could never be finished on the table. They were given to her by Roland, and they were found out from the ruins. Seeing that her body was drowned by books, the ash always felt inexplicable distress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Tilly put down the quill and leaned back easily. "She doesn't want me to hold the connection with the secular forces alone." I have no reason to reject her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The man is your brother, why do she think she can be like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because she is also a member of the royal family," Tilly smiled and shook her head. "The higher the status, the weaker the family. The kingdom is the same. Heti is very clear about this. Will make this decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She intends to compete with you for the support of His Royal Highness?" Ashes frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not so fast, this time I think she is just going to explore the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Then you promised her!" The ashes loosened their hands and the voice was low. "It seems that I have to talk to her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;正It is the affinity and tolerance of His Royal Highness that makes the witches who have been devastated and oppressed by the church trust and unite together, but this does not mean that one can regard tolerance as weakness and trust as the bottom line of temptation. If anyone wants to break it all, she will never let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes haven’t had time to turn around, and Tilly grabbed her arm. “Why don’t you agree? As I said before, I have no reason to refuse. Sleeping Island It’s our homeland, all the witches are free people here, as long as they don’t endanger everyone’s safety, I won’t stop them. And...” She vented her breath, “It’s not a bad thing to let them go to the West.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not... bad things?" Ashes wondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you ever thought about why the initial bloody teeth are no different from other witches, but now they are slowly emerging?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought for a while, "because...the reason why life is settled?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Tilly nodded Tao, "Before the church was like a mountain, it was in everyone's mind. In order to survive, everyone must be close together. But now the churches of the fjord islands have been eradicated, and the island has gained a more relaxed environment, and the people naturally begin. Floating, this is a normal phenomenon. We are different from the Communist Youth League, and it is a complex of many witch organizations, so blind suppression is not feasible. We want a strong enemy to let everyone still work together as originally. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy frowns, "Do you mean...the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fertile plains deep The enemy, the fiasco of the federation, the upcoming third battle of gods... these things let We personally understand that it is much more effective than telling me.” Tilly smiled. “And in Bianbu Town, they can see more than that—”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The five kings stood up and walked to the front of the study room leading to the back garden and pushed the threshold open. "They will see that non-combat witches can also play an irreplaceable role, and they will see ordinary people own beautiful witches." Ability, you will see the amazing effects of all when you unite. Just like this door... When you push it away, you will have a wider world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The gray woman quietly looking at the woman who was bathed in the sun could not say a word. The gray hair reflects the dazzling luster, and as the sea breeze flutters, even the back is beautiful and indescribable. Time seems to have solidified here. In this small study, only she and herself are left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
