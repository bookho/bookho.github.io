			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the next morning when you get out of your dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland excitedly waved his fist in bed and his guess was fulfilled! Not only his room... Every resident in the soul building should have a door leading to memory debris, and the location of the gates is the place where the losers have placed their greatest hopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he did not guess wrong, the last memory of the three kings would stay in the clear water port - the beginning of her life and the road to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Garcia is likely to hang up at any time, Roland has not gone further into the world of entry, after all, he is in a slightly awkward position, being a martial art Being a thief is not a pleasant experience. Before leaving 0827, he also slammed the news about the door of memory by complaining about the useless iron gates in his house, but the reaction of the other party was very indifferent and could be said to be of no interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that she is either lying or she has not noticed the weird iron gate even if she renovated the entire utility room. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s the latter, it’s worth it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents in the soul building can't touch the dusty memory at all, and they are the exception to see and open the door to memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to verify it is very simple, the next time I use the excuse of cleaning to let Jielu go to the sundries for a circle, you can know the answer to the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, this is definitely an exciting discovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He naturally does not need to explore every household thoroughly, the devils devoured by the devil are the focus - they have now become residents of the soul building, Find them, enter their memory fragments, and maybe find some intelligence that will help the Battle of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came to the office, Wendy had been waiting in the room for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a stack of resumes on the desk, which is the detailed information about the four wolves, although he has already learned the general situation from the mouth of the mouth, But it does not prevent him from reviewing it completely, especially those that happened in the wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at the record completed by Wendy and the book, and finally stopped on Anne’s name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he first heard of Anne, he felt very familiar, until the night reminder, he remembered the grievances of the bloody teeth and the wolf witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Anne is a very common name, especially among the poor people who are born in the poor, there are at least five or six of Anne in a hundred women. It’s not unusual to repeat. . It is only now that the resume clearly records that she did find a bloody meeting, not only refused, but was almost sold to the nobility, so a great chance is the "Annie Sister" in the mouth of Iphi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that such a coincidence is really full of drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week ago, he had received a flight letter from the fjord, saying that Tilly and others were on the road, and now the flight is almost halfway, just don’t know two What kind of expression will people face when they meet? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reunion is not all joy, Effie will be full of joy and embarrassment, but Anne, will she forgive the person who once "betrayed" her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sighed in secret and hoped that time would smooth the scar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his resume and looked up at Wendy. "Is the trip today decided?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, Your Majesty," the latter replied, "the North Slope Mine, the Steam Engine Assembly Plant and the Chaos Beverage Factory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaded by the Witch Alliance The newcomer’s visit to No Winter City is Wendy’s suggestion. She believes that this will better enable foreign witches to become familiar with local life while eliminating unnecessary caution and misunderstanding. It is a common practice in the Union to visit for two days, take a day off, and then voluntarily choose whether to sign a contract. Since Roland entrusted Witch management to Wendy, she has gradually embarked on the right track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
