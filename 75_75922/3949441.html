			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver looks more real than the lotus that looks far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the walls of the Tsuchiya, she can see that the soldiers are busy in an orderly manner, everyone is doing a single repetitive move, but seven or eight people are connected It has become a complex whole of the flow of water. The paper bags and iron balls piled up behind the compartments were continuously sent into the thick iron pipe, and then ejected as a thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look further, Hilli notices that the soldier first ignited a rope at the end of the iron pipe, and the spark of the jump broke into the inside of the iron pipe, leading the way. The first paper bag to be filled. The light of the next moment made her unable to hold her eyes, and the spark quickly expanded into an orange-red fireball that filled every hole in the tube. The inflated flame has nowhere to go, so I have to wrap it around the iron ball and throw it out like a giant hand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the blink of an eye, the iron ball turned into a black shadow and ran straight into the sailboat in the river. Its strength is so great that a fist-sized hole is drilled directly on the ship's side of the board. Although the speed of the wooden board has slowed down a lot, the power is still not to be underestimated. An enemy who wants to climb out of the cabin is hit by the waist and suddenly breaks into two pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver is the first time I see it - no sharp edges or swords, and a round ball can also be a point For two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the line of sight is too close, she even thinks that the blood and internal organs that have been blown by the killer have already splashed on herself, and then several people have been hit by the iron ball It is not to cut off the limbs, or to break the head. For a time, there were rogue blood and red and white organs everywhere in the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witch suddenly felt a surge in her stomach, and a sour water rushed straight into her throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vo..." The scene in the cabin suddenly disappeared - the chaotic thoughts could no longer sustain the ability to perform, and Sylvie was forced to interrupt the real Eye connection, bowed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" The lotus, who was shocked, immediately stepped forward to hold her. "Are you alright?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Royal Highness also noticed her discomfort and handed a handkerchief. "If you feel bloody, don't read it, at least don't use the ability to watch it at close range. Let's take a break."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you..." Sylvia took the handkerchief and wiped his mouth. "I'm fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This is probably the "inconceivable invention" that Mai Hao and Lightning said, but at that time, everyone did not listen to it, or did not mind at all. After all, before I witnessed it, it was difficult to imagine such an amazing weapon in my mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked back at the battlefield and saw that the fleet of Tefko began to approach the two sides - apparently they also noticed that this storm-like attack came from After the dwarf house on the shore disguised as a slope. However, the other party did not know that the work arranged by His Royal Highness Roland was far more than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the farther away from the V-shaped line of defense, there is a hidden bunker covered with weeds and vines, the distance between them is exactly the same as the length of the fleet. Unless they do not hesitate to transfer the bow directly to evacuate, or landing at any point, will only fall into the trap of the front and rear pinch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers in the bunker also hold a long round iron, and the launch is no longer a round iron ball, but a sharp tailless弩矢. They don't look as unstoppable as iron balls, but they can also be replaced with flesh-and-blood bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi guessed that the enemy probably wanted to wait until after the entire team to fight back, but the soldiers in the bunker did not give them this opportunity - just like the previous strikes. They don't even have to show their heads, just aim the weapon at the target and easily pull the trigger, and the cockroach is splashing toward the opponent like rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a rapid attack, there is no need for a weapon to be wounded, and the enemy has not persisted for a long time and the whole line has collapsed. The person who got off the boat wanted to return to the boat, and the person standing on the side of the ship waiting to disembark escaped. The hull swayed sharply, and the springboard was turned into the water. Many drowners were shot while climbing the ship's side. The scene was chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's time," until then, the prince put down the lookout and ordered the iron axe. "Take a reserve team to clean up the battlefield if they The leading knights are lucky not to fight, but they want to ask them some questions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
