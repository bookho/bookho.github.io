			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change in the factory area is not just that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland noticed that many workers along the way were replacing the billboards on both sides of the road. The construction site that was always roaring was quiet at the moment, as if it were big. In the blink of an eye, the Auto City project went to the building; the scaffolding was set up inside and outside the low wall used to separate the construction site, and it seems that it is planned to build a new exterior wall on this basis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More exaggerated is that he also saw a lot of armed police armed with ammunition, set up a cordon and checkpoint outside the project department, and the intruders need to check their identity. Vehicles are not allowed to be near the project building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After verifying his and Garcia’s documents, the armed police conducted a standard military ceremony and then opened the door for the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God..." Garcia whispered, "What did you do for the association?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be honest, I don't know more than you now." Roland shook his head innocently. "I didn't ask anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The two walked to the front of the building, and Garcia's footsteps were slightly stunned, and he frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who stood outside the door to greet them was her father, one of the members of the Sanye board of directors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am waiting for you for a long time." The other party nodded to the daughter first, then took the initiative to reach out, "Mr. Roland, although I knew it when I first met. You are extraordinary, but I didn't expect it to exceed my expectations. Starting from today, this factory is yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia Deming said Congratulations, there is not much joy in the tone - his expression is quite complicated, like a collection of contradictions. If the middle-aged man had obvious contempt during the first meeting, and the second time because the relationship between the guards was replaced by disguise, then this time the emotional exposure is probably his true feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"New Energy Auto City was originally a key project of the Sanye Group. Is it really good to give it away?" Garcia said sarcastically. The public wants to dismantle the package, I thought that the Sanye Group would behave a bit harder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Guardian did not show twilight, and It’s a bitter smile. “The martial arts association has opened up a condition that the family can’t refuse. Although I am a member of the board of directors, I can’t stop this decision. In addition, the Sanye Group officially suspended the plan for the demolition and reconstruction of the Bozilou community. It will be announced at the reception - you no longer need to scream for the residents, daughter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garcia slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Demolition... is it over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it’s all over." Slow down, "I know that even if it is in the past, you will not forgive me easily, but we are at least no longer "enemies." If you want to see your brother in the future, you can come to the house at any time, of course..." He looked at Roland. "Take him also." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending a misunderstood two people into the hall, Guardian waved his hand and left the project building.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;have not waited for the two to come back, the responsible secretary has brought them into the main conference room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly 100 square meters of room There are forty or fifty people sitting in the inner circumference. Almost everyone wears formal attire. It is not like a meeting in the construction site. There are four chairs at the head end of the long table. In addition to the guardian stone, there are two other seats. People - one is about forty or fifty years old, with a capable face; the other is white, but his eyes are full of energy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest The chair was obviously left for him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garcia is now waking up from the previous confusion and gently pushing him behind his back.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded, steadily stepped forward, sitting on the side of the rock.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been a king After the experience, he will naturally not Kinds of occasions stage fright meaning, actually more curious minds - from the time the pies of view, the association is clearly going to give him a surprise <br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
