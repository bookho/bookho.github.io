			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two weeks of study and exploration, at the end of the first month of the spring of the new year, the town hall chief Barov, at the request of His Royal Highness, in the castle parlor The first expansion meeting of the first city hall was held. In addition to the heads of the various departments of the first plenary session, this expansion meeting will also include some of the fortress aristocrats, and the number of participants reached 65. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learning process itself is an assessment. After a year in which Barov is in charge of the City Hall, it is easy to tell which aristocrats are suitable for such work, and which nobles have There is no cultivation value - so nearly half of the nobility is excluded from this level alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to His Highness, he has given these little nobles a chance to catch a fast bus. If they missed it, there is no way to keep up with the people of the times. Will be eliminated by the times. Barov shared this feeling. Regardless of whether he is a devil or a god, his territory has already presented a different kind of weather from the rest of the kingdom. If this is a new era, he would be happy to go with the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main content of todayâ€™s meeting is to make a final vote on the unified law after the founding of the city, while letting the fortress aristocrats know the content of the law in advance, Barov is This preparation has been for a long time, and now it is finally time to unveil the opening cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people have a thin hardcover book in front of them, with a bunch of golden characters on the cover - The Basic Law of the Kingdom, this is also The core law was edited by His Royal Highness the Prince himself. From the point of view of the name, it is known that His Royal Highness is far away, and he believes that the power of His Royal Highness should not only work in the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Began," Roland, sitting at the top of the long table, nodded and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Barov cleared his throat. "Maybe everyone in the City Hall knows about the upcoming New City in the West, and this law before you." The law is the general law that will be implemented after the completion of the temple. You can refer to it yourself, or you can listen to me. Any questions can be raised on-site and answered by His Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene sounded a sound of the book, and he also opened the thick cover, revealing the first page written in refined parchment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first thing you see is the general outline, which refers to the structure and system of the new territory..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "In the first article, all the powers under the jurisdiction of Roland Wimbledon are owned by Roland Wimbledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 2. The City Hall is the highest authority of the Territory, under the leadership of Roland Wimbledon, to deal with all matters relating to territorial governance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Third Articles, the inflowing population in the territory can be promoted to a formal citizen through various channels, and the city hall should maintain at least three ways of promotion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After becoming a formal citizen, there will be no more free people, hired peasants, servants, slaves, and no men and women. The citizens are protected by the law, have all the guarantees and benefits of the territory, and also pay taxes, service, and royalties. The obligation of the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Article 5, the nobility is also a member of the official citizen, the title no longer has The power should be inherited as an honorary title."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Article 6, the public's personal safety and legal property are protected by Roland Wimbledon and are inviolable. "Article VII, citizens should have the right to education, the right to free choice of work, and the right to free marriage."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Article 8, the Territory encourages legitimate business conduct and free trade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Article 9, ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balofo slammed the pages of the book, one by one. The laws enacted by the nobility rarely involve the people, even the free people of the city. In the eyes of the great aristocrats, they are only the objects used for exploitation and recruitment. The people under the people are rare. Probably he really believes that only relying on the power of the people can fight the coming doomsday war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baroph does not care whether His Royal Highness depends on the aristocracy or the people. He only wants to do everything he can to fulfill his duties, so that these powers can be tightened. Hold in your hand. In Wangdu, he transferred from the Astrologer Association to the Finance Minister as an assistant. He thought that he would soon be able to set foot on the top of the Greysburg Kingdom. He did not expect that the first-class is ten years, and the turbulent mood gradually became numb. The reason for agreeing to the request of Wimbledon III, following the four princes to the border town, in addition to a false promise, there is also the feeling of broken cans. Unexpectedly, he has now realized his expectations in another way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
