			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower loop was opened for about twenty minutes and the navigation showed the arrived location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked around, only to find that there was no building in the vicinity that could be built with the hospital, but I saw several gorgeous and comparable art exhibitions. The new building of the pavilion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's here." Garcia nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure?" Roland bluntly drove the car to the entrance, noting that there were several large characters on the wall of the Rheinland Green Sanatorium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, because every new person I bring in is basically the same as you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After the gate, he quickly walked out of a few suits and sunglasses, wearing a pair of sunglasses, and surrounded by the car. One of them knocked on the window glass. "Sorry, this is a private territory, no parking service."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but pump his mouth, feed... ...how is this treatment, he said that he is coming to stop, can't visit patients after opening bread? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is preparing to take out the hunting license and call the other person’s face. Garcia has shaken the window and handed over a card. “The car has not been bought for a long time. The license plate has not been entered yet, you can register it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is obviously stunned. After taking the card, he looks at the car and turns back to the monitoring room. . When I came out again, my attitude was completely different. "Sorry, Miss Garcia, the car you used to register is not this one, so we are -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it not normal to change the car?" Garcia interrupted the other party calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is...but also." The man looked at Roland again. "Excuse me, this is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My driver."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere at the scene became a bit stiff at the moment, and finally the leader took the lead, "I understand. Now, we will add a new license plate number for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the gate opens, Roland releases the clutch, and the van is slowly opening in the slamming exhaust sound. Entered the gate of the sanatorium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rearview mirror, he can probably guess the feelings of those people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change the car can only change the bread, but also insist on asking the driver, Garcia is probably the most lonely martial artist they have ever seen...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I thought you wouldn’t lie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's because you don't understand I," Garcia shrugged. "In the case of irrelevant principles, I am not as rigid as you think. Not to mention that you are a member of the association, but the identity card has not been sent."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hid a hunting license not work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Except for a few people, the specific holder of the license has been The secret of the association, this is the opposite of the star martial arts." Garcia seriously said, "It represents the association's affirmation and commitment, but it will also increase the risk of being attacked. There have been several devils in the history of the association. The people are killing the records of the martial arts, and the latter are basically hunters who have exposed their identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, It had disclosed the identity of demons will fall to an endless supply of natural core fingertips? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, considering the safety of Jieluo and other people in the community, Roland finally dismissed the idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meeting, he could no longer simply treat the people in the dream world as illusory NPCs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the sanatorium, Roland found that there is a hole in the sky - the area is extremely large, the bridges and gardens have everything, and the roadside can even see Road signs such as hot spring areas, swimming pools, golf courses, etc. are not inferior to some high-end scenic spots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if he became the king of the Grey Fort, he did not think that the hospital could be built like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inpatient building is located in the center of the sanatorium. From the perspective of the silver-plated glass curtain wall, it is no exaggeration to say that it is a star hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two entered the hall, and a burly man like a mountain rushed forward. He was about forty years old and his skin was bronzed. The bulging muscles of the body raised the martial arts robes, and the fluctuations of the natural forces on the body were also very obvious. The pressure of Roland felt the pressure of ten meters. & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp <br /> <br /> ". He is the master of masters," Garcia whispered something, then people always hung his head slightly, "guarding you ......" <br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry about the embarrassing thing." The meteorite squatted down and held her shoulders and said, "I didn't protect her."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he mentioned it, Garcia’s look was a little sad. She shook her head. “It’s not your fault... When she was alive, she often said that the martial arts family always had One day will sacrifice life in order to fight erosion. If you are afraid, you will not be eligible to become a member of the association."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She taught a good disciple," meteorite exclaimed, "Do not worry, I will let intruders who pay the price." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "I am willing to expel erosion presented a force." <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone nodded and nodded, stood up and looked at Roland. "You should be the expert of the hunting slayer, Mr. Roland." The first time we met, I was one of the four rock guarding the prism city "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;". Hello, "Roland shook hands with each other and take the initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thanks to your activity, the contradiction between the old and the new is eased. I have to thank you for this." Rock said straight away, " In the future, please continue to protect the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is incumbent." Roland replied categorically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dare to dig the corners of his dream world, how can you not completely remove these guys? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence also made Jiaxia’s emotions a lot, probably the feeling that people who brought them out finally got on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is three o'clock, the visit officially begins - about 20 people in the whole team, led by Shishi, obviously the prism city did not let The top executives did, but selected some representative figures, such as the star martial arts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, when she saw her, Roland was somewhat guilty. After all, in the last joint annihilation operation, he not only let the spirit knock on all survivors, but also Inadvertently let the Fijian language hear the clue. Originally, I was prepared to die and refused to pay, but I did not expect that the other party actually did not raise an objection. But he would never think that the other party has forgotten about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on the way to the road, Roland is as far as possible to keep the furthest distance from Fiji, and can not speak without speaking. Fortunately, she was quite popular with everyone, no matter which room she went to, it was the focus of attention, but she did not have the time to look for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaking hands with the injured and encouraging a few words is almost the whole process of the activity. Since Garcia is not in the ranks, he is also a newcomer to the association. Almost a high-level executive does not know, so the whole event is not so much a visit, but rather a familiar face with the guard. I am afraid that the other party is looking for him, but also for this consideration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wounded in the next room is called Wakiris," the doctor of the same company looked at the list. "She had been hurt before, she should have let her Take a good rest. But since you are here, just go in and have a look. If you can, please try to be quiet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, members of the association Rehabilitation is the most important thing.” Meteorite nodded and pushed open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wards in the building are single rooms, the area is bigger than the residence of the tube building, and more than 20 people are relaxed. Roland walked by the end of the team as usual, and it was his turn to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he looked at the other person in the crowd, he couldn’t help but be surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
