			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First point, get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia gracefully lifts long hair The fallen snow on the top of the head, to the ashes Nunu, "The next move will be handed over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait...why I?" The latter rounded his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are so strong," she said. "This is a small team competition. It is natural to work together. Listen, we represent the face of the island. If the game loses because you are moving too slowly, I will tell His Royal Highness one by one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overwhelming victory! Nightingale, have you seen it? Andrea looked proudly at the same time, but she could only bend over to resist the ashes of the stunned beast, and felt very comfortable in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, she can't move these dead things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You stay here, don't move, I will be back soon," the extraordinary person put the sturdy wild boar on his shoulder and turned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ashes leave, Andrea Looking up at the forest, "Leaves, trouble tells me where the next evil beast is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your right side, 450 meters Besides, the snow wolf species." The branch swayed. "But don't you wait for her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, it is too slow." Andre Meditating for a while, "Well... almost nine hundred steps away, I set off, then please tell me about my new position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaf silence For a moment, "I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, but only stupid wolf, if you remind, it can't touch me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the giant hybrid that I met last time, there is only one dead end in front of her new ability - the original magic arrow is amazing, but the range is only Ten steps, but now only the magic Abundant, she will be enough to equal the power of the shot projection hundred meters, with the ability to accurately hit the branch, even if the evil beast long two pairs of wings, she also can not escape the blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This game, she won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Sorry, I didn't expect him to let you participate in this trivial matter," Felice looked at Aegis in front of her. "I was just taking it down."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she first heard this proposal, she didn't think too much, because she lost her taste, and the chaotic drink was delicious again. What she promised was just a simple curiosity. - Anyway, idle is also idle, it is better to take advantage of the opportunity to observe the Witch Alliance's combat ability is good. Unexpectedly, this hunting was actually a group match, and her teammates were the youngest high-level witch Ai Gesha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, it's not bad to study the magic stone all day long, and occasionally come out," Aegusa shrugged. "If I don't want to It’s a waste of time, and you won’t be able to promise you at the beginning.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is that the case? Then...what are we going to grab a few evil bets and bring them back to make up?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's how it works, this is the game."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the mortal king is not saying friendship first, The second game? Everyone else should be like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They don’t really think so, look at the expression, you know What the guys are paying attention to. Even if there is no chaotic drink for the prize, Lightning and Andrea are not willing to lose to anyone.” Ai Gesha paused. “If it’s just an ordinary game, but we are now Takila team, isn’t it right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes...” I don’t know why, Felice actually felt that the other side was full of fighting spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
