			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland walked into the living room, he was immediately obscured by the half of the wall. The light curtain of the face is attracted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the edge of the light curtain, there is a faint purple light, like a passage through the wall to connect different planes. The scene on the other side is very dark, like a huge hollow in the depths of the ground. The thin red river flowing like a spider web illuminates the rock walls and domes, and the outlines of ancient ruins are faintly visible. From the perspective of realistic visual effects, this should not be the fictional scene of the other party, but a real-time live broadcast across thousands of miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge sarcoma monster is facing him, his tentacles are opening, and strange voices sound directly in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I have been waiting for you... Dear King of the Grey Fort, Roland Wimbledon. I am Pasha, the survivor of Tacula I must have heard of our news from Felice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original direct contact is such a thing," Roland sat across from the light curtain. Next, with him, there are Nightingale, Aisha, Wendy and the book. "You have to talk for a while, so I don't have to introduce myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't look surprised at me at all," Pasha looked a little surprised. "I thought it would take a long time for you to accept that we are witches."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the concepts of possession and prosthetic, I have seen too much, Roland thought in his heart, but still said calmly, "Red Moon is coming, time For both of us, there are few things left. It’s better to be honest with each other than to hide and suspicion from the beginning, since you used to be The mainland's executives should be able to understand this truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa took a moment and then chuckled, "Fillis is right, you It’s indeed a rare and extraordinary person.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m just standing on the shoulders of my predecessors,” Roland said. “That’s right, we all have a common The purpose is to fight against the devil. You sent the purpose of Felice, in addition to looking for the winners, but also have the desire to communicate with the secular kingdom, I have not guessed this?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly," Pasha admitted. "In the beginning, we only thought about infiltrating and slowly recruiting or controlling some mortals to search for the best. The money in the morning kingdom is one of them." But the failure of the church has led us to another hope, that is, to stand in front of the station and concentrate all the witches in one place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So Have you seen the Grey Fort?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The collected information shows the fjord The Sleeping Island has the largest witch organization, the leader of which is the sister of the King of Graysburg, and the Grey Fort is the big country that defeated the church by hand. Therefore, it is a very suitable choice as the first stop to find the winner. But I did not expect it. Felic will be on the line with you so quickly, and it brings a shocking news. To be honest, we thought it would take at least two or three years to achieve this. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, it seems that we have saved another two or three years. This achievement alone is enough to make the talks go down in history." Roland smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems like this is true," Pasha laughed. "The premise is that we can defeat the devil and continue to survive and thrive in the light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, as long as ordinary people and witches put down the barriers and work together, the devil is not an enemy that cannot be defeated." Rolandton paused, "I can help you too." Looking for the winners, after all, a powerful weapon against the devil is always a good thing, but cooperation must be based on mutual understanding, what do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Agree," Pasha's tentacles swayed together. "If you want to know anything, please, sire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and successively with Ai Ge Shake, Wendy and the book looked at each other and slowly began. "After I knew the buried history from Felice, my biggest misunderstanding was what you found in the remains. Does Takila break with the Star City, and even lead to the collapse of the Federation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
