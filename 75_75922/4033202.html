			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Livya’s remarks, Roland couldn’t help but feel very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no complicated story. Gordon Wimbledon is the commander of the border guards. Every year, he goes to the Cold Wind Ridge to help the church fight against the evil spirits. When the pub was having fun, I met Li Fuya, who accompanied the wine girl. The two of them went to love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in the identity of Lifia, it is almost impossible to marry into the palace, Gordon does not dare to speak, just quietly buy a house in the town, as two The secret of man loves the nest. How many of their feelings are true Roland is not clear, but in the memory, Goron did not find other lovers in the king, the marriage between the nobles was also completely rejected, and even the rumors of the big prince like male style, for an adult For the royal family, it is indeed incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the secret letter that Livya handed up, the content is even more shocking - Goron seems to insist on turning the civilian witch into a queen, if only Oral talk about it, but also leave written evidence, if it is leaked out, Wimbledon III will never give him a good look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the good times are not long, and since the news that the great prince was sentenced to death by the Fabio to the north, Livya’s peaceful life was quickly broken— - After the rush, the guards left by Goron left without saying goodbye. Then the house was stolen and lost the source of life. She had to return to the tavern where she worked before and re-emerged as a wine girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is not over yet. The pub owner seems to be extremely dissatisfied with her sudden departure. She started to work on her, and then forced her to seduce her. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past six months, Livya’s life has been extremely bad. The boss’s wife did not dare to complain too much to her husband. All the fire was nominally The maid of her. The boss often turns a blind eye and sometimes joins in the bullying of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland certainly won’t blame her for not being strong enough. As an ordinary person who has no dependence, there are too many ways to make it surrender. It is the first demand. In addition, the disappearance of the guard and the subsequent theft may not be accidental. She can clearly know the location of her money, and when she is absent, she decisively starts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what do you want me to do for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no relationship with Goron At all, it is not an exaggeration to say that the four princes are counted. The reason he decided to help each other was only because Livya himself - able to endure all the way to this, insisting on the woman who is waiting for the opportunity to save herself, its heart is already worthy of praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's more, for today's Roland, this little thing is just a little effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the delicious dumplings, he never thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swears! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to leave the pub... squat," she whispered. "Can you help me find a new job?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure you have to stay in the North? If the tavern owner is not in love with you, it will not let you go." Roland said, he did not intend to personally intervene. In this kind of civil dispute, it is too expensive. "You can follow the fleet to the West, where there is no shortage of work, food and house."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Livya hesitated, and the voice was lower. "Your Majesty... I, I want to stay here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think she is afraid of you. "The snoring of the nightingale came from the ear. "For ordinary people, her appearance is at least half the level of Isis, and the beauty of the pub owner is very normal."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "nonsense", Roland responded with a slogan, then nodded. "Well, I will inform the Duke of Calvin, let him send you to Yongyecheng." If you are worried about going back late today, Sean can find a hotel for you overnight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will never forget your kindness, Your Majesty," she again Hey, "But... I have to go back today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem," Roland raised a brow and looked at Sean. "Send this lady." One way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
