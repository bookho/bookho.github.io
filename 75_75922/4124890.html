			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?" Victor asked at the picture, "What about the new drama?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linglong came close and looked at the newspaper a few times. "No, adults... This picture should refer to the shadow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Magic?" is another term that has never been heard. It is awesome in the future. Gem merchants can't wait to ask. "Can you explain it to me in detail?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The maid is a bit awkward. "This... I don't know too well. A few days ago, the same picture was hung on the central square, but it was colored. I heard that the shadow is a brand new performance. And even need to build a special stage for them to watch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the times...the art, dare to use such words to describe, the gray castle Wang’s confidence in it is evident, and Victor’s thoughts on a slightly rough paper seem to be worth looking forward to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed a few lines of small characters below the big characters, which read the time and place of the show, and the way to buy tickets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was Victor's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait... The fare is forty gold dragons? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not mistaken! This has exceeded the performance price of the top drama group in Huiguang City! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that he can’t afford the money, just a city where no jewelry is in the crowd, how could someone be willing to play for a magical show? Pour all of it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, there’s still... Victor winks and continues to look down, and can’t help but mutter, “If you have no winter The citizen of the ID card can obtain the exclusive discount for the voucher. Only 25 silver wolves can be booked. Note: The original price experience is better, the number of times is limited, the first order is first served, the expired is not available; Drinks and food, do not accept their own, please prepare in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really... two different days! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jewelers are not having seen a commodity to buy two prices, but it will not be too far away, after all, the cost is there. Moreover, most of these transactions are conducted privately and will not be placed directly on the face. Otherwise, those who spend more money will inevitably complain, and it will be difficult to do the business of the other party next time, without the practice of the Winter City. It can be said that he opened his eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only is it written on paper, but it also sets a lot of restrictions, as if people who want to pay more for this money have to rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he found himself to be one of the rushers...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has to It is said that this kind of sales method has a strange attraction - it can afford four gold dragons, at least it must be a big businessman or a noble family. It is a proof of strength, not to mention himself. I am curious about the shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor jumped off the soft couch and put the wolf skin coat on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult?" exquisitely whispered. She was obviously ready, leaving only a thin veil on her body, and now she was sitting in the bedding and looking at him with all her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor picked up the clothes that the maid had faded from the ground and threw it into her arms. "Where is the pre-order of the Shadows? Take me past, now!" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The shooting of "The Legend of Wolf Heart" has entered the final stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long princess will greet the final battle with the devil lord in the palace, and Roland will let out the entire castle floor for the crew to take a picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Star Mei Yi is now the main person in charge of the Shadow, in order to achieve the best results, she even pushed her role, single-minded Invest in rehearsal and guidance work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The teacher is also working hard," the troupe staff replied in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she is replaced by her, she will be opposite with a white eye, but now she just smiles and nods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the tempering of the years, Mayi thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After moving to the border area, I really changed a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful with the wood residue," Carter Lannis, who was on the side, immediately came together. "Would you like me to hold you?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is watching," Mayi is not good, her husband's temper is impeccable, but his words and deeds are not like an upright knight, nor Knowing what was under him in the past, he actually picked him to be the chief knight, "I can go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I walked in front," Carter stepped over to her in front of her, sweeping a path for her with her feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall backs suddenly cover the light coming in from the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Mayi unconsciously raise his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she knows that she must not let the other person discover it, otherwise it will only make him more proud, and will eventually get involved in the evening...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you ready for tomorrow's performance? Don't be missed by Miss Luo Jia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of drama, Carter suddenly succumbed to his face. "Can you please ask her to be soft when she starts? In the last time in the snow, I almost didn't spit out the food in my stomach. The power of her after the wolf was almost ashes." It’s all monster level.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you know? Only actors have succumbed to drama, and no drama has succumbed to actors, let alone The magic shadow is much more real than the drama.” Mey masked. “So the solution is very simple. Don’t eat too much before tomorrow.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chief knight was a little bit stunned and shook his head and opened the subject. "Right, guess who I saw in the dock area today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "Oh... once a lover?" Mayi shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible!" Carter hurried back and said, "It’s Kajin Fez."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mei couldn't help but stop. "Really?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, he is also a celebrity of Wang Du, how can I misread? "It’s probably noticed the change in her eyes. Carter grinned." And there are a large number of people who disembarked with him. I think it’s probably his performance team. At that time, there were many people who recognized Mr. Kajin. Almost clogged. How, is this message worth a kiss?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Value!" Mayi did not hesitate, "I want to visit him!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carkin Fez, the name is almost a representative of the drama - since he took the stage, he has conquered all the audience in almost thirty years, from the south to the Northland, any actor who wants to climb the summit can not avoid him. After half a year, Kajin could no longer be active on the stage, so he went from behind the stage to the background, specializing in script writing, and now still has great influence in the world of drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mey went to Wang Du’s performance, he stood under the eyes of everyone through his play "The Prince's Love Story". Without the guidance and praise of Kajin Fez, she would not be the real star of the West – at least not so quickly recognized by everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you will say this," Carter handed over a note. "I have already asked you for the hotel they stayed in, but I have to supervise it." When the craftsman puts the door on, he will not accompany you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!" Mey took a note with joy and said, "It doesn't matter, my name is The people in the troupe were --" Then she looked at the members who were still tidying up the set props in the castle, and said in a sigh of relief, "Irene, Dina, Rocha, Gate, Swallow! Come to me!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
