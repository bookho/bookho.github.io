			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The devil is not a blind man!" Her voice just fell, and Effie immediately vetoed, "You can see Tacula with the help of the setting sun, they must also Can see you! There is no cover in the air, do you want to be a target?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also feel too risky," Lotus said, "I mention Li Daren said that you can only control the flying magic stone straight up and down. If you are found, you can't even escape. You can't go to see it in the middle of the night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the dissuasion of the two, especially the bloody witches, the ash was quite emotional. They were still hostile opponents a year ago, and Herti Morgan even wanted to put her and Tilly to death. If it wasn't for Tilly's insistence on tolerance, she would have already started to work on the blood. I thought it was a crack that could not be eliminated by the sleeping island. I didn't expect that things would happen like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now they are on the same front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the tactics she envisioned depend on the collaboration of all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to being dark in the evening, nothing can be seen - the ruins are now vines, there is not enough light to find out where it is, so at dusk It is the most suitable opportunity." Ashes insisted. "Maybe we have not deviated from the intended direction. The ruins may be after a jungle or a short slope. All I have to do is fly and crush the magic stone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is a flying devil in the vicinity to find you?" Lotus frowned. "Is your fighting ability in the air not even able to play out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have completely thought about the countermeasures," Ashes calmly extended three fingers. "Depending on the situation, there are three plans--" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" The track curiously came together. "Isn't this what Mr. Tilly often said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really?" Lotus's expression also has a little loose, "Talk about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;"Listen, the only chance to discover me during the time period of the lift-off observation is the fearful beast with the madman, so the three situations are met with a beast, two beasts and Three beasts, three of them are also dealt with by three, so that they can be foolproof."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God..." Lotus stunned Forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey," even Effie couldn’t help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, you are not going to listen to the specific operational plans under the three conditions. What is the opinion?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I am McMug, I will definitely agree with my hands," said the track in a serious way. "I finally know why the guy used to act with you before."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end, Ashes still persuaded everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the words of Lian, it is "although the first half of the assumption sounds very unreliable, but the response measures are unexpectedly ok"; The view is "the instinct of the beasts accumulated in thousands of actual combat" - and of course the most important thing is that they can't think of a better way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day of walking through the ground, the light seen through the vents has gradually turned, and the white clouds seem to be lit, blending into the dim dome. . Obviously the sun is just a little hidden into the end of the fertile plains, and the time for the planned action is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the trajectory taking a mark on the ashes, a blue "spot" appeared on the top of the latter out of thin air - it looks like a puddle, soft light Shaking in the water, as if three people are standing under the water, looking up at the blue sky above the water through the undulating squats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash knows that this is only the inherent form of the channel, not the real picture of the other end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that there was no demon patrol around the hiding place, she nodded to the three and poured magic into the ring. Then an indescribable feeling surrounded her, as if it were a hand or a foot - and Tilly called it "wings." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ashes close your eyes, imagine yourself flapping your wings, then jump up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, fresh air rushed to the surface, and the sound of rustling in the shade of the trees sounded. In addition, there are the screaming of the homing bird, the screaming of the worm, and the whistling of the evening wind across the cheeks - the constant space of the earth becomes very rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened her eyes, the whole world suddenly opened up, the earth quickly narrowed down at the foot, and the channel exit quickly turned into a slightly invisible light spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of this...Occasionally it may not be bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes put away the view of the scenery, staring at the north, and suddenly sinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if she didn’t see the end of her sight, she didn’t find a place like a ruin, let alone the skeleton monster in the wolf’s mouth—besides being dwarfed by Yu Hui There is nothing outside the woods and grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they completely find the wrong direction? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned back and wanted to judge the current position from the direction of the desolate mountains, but slammed it - I saw the jungle in the southeast A few giants, just a few miles away from her. Underneath the devil's creations with obvious unnatural features is a broken wall, the remains of the holy city of Taqila! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that they are not walking away enough, but the accumulated deviations allow them to cross the relics from the east! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you put it on the map, this location may be only one or two degrees from the scheduled route, but in reality, the deviation is arriving at Takira. The difference between the front and the rear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you turn around to the south, I am afraid it will take another two or three days; she can also fly directly to the south, complete the positioning and then fly back, at most half a day. - But in addition to straight up and down, she really did not try to fly flat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, before the decision was made by the ashes, a dull horn was heard from Takira. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this horn, the skeleton monster rushed up to ten beasts, and rushed toward her position! At the same time, the land around the ruins also smashed a black-pressed madman, which surrounded the holy city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it seems that their vigilance is quite high, she thought, more than three or more are calculated by three, which seems to be the worst in the plan. The situation is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egree does not hesitate to pick up the colorful magic stone, pinch it into powder, and then plant it down -<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important ability of a warrior is to judge the situation and then respond accordingly: one beast is oyster, two beasts are strangled, and three or more are retreating. Not because she didn't have the confidence to deal with so many devils, just that she couldn't make sure that they all shut up before they fired an alarm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the current situation, the risk of using the broken bridge to approach the Takula ruins has undoubtedly increased significantly, so even though the location is not ideal, only Can give up on this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She does not have the amazing talent of Tilly, she can control the "wings" like an arm, but she has her own way to make the flight speed Faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to instill more magic for the Magic Stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the magic continues to grow, the ashes can feel the invisible wings behind them have expanded to the limit, and every imaginary fan is rolling up the wind. She almost fell to the ground like a rush, and her speed was three or four times faster than when she was rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is the magical spear of the madman, it is impossible to hurt her in such a state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the extremely high speed brings great inertia. Due to the limitation of the length of the channel, the lotus can only create a hollow of ten steps, so short. The distance is by her alone and there is absolutely no way to stop the momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
