			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, Roland Wimbledon’s fleet arrived at Chishui City Pier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Delta, who had already received the news, seemed to pay more attention to it. Not only did he send the dock to sweep the dock from the inside out, but he also hung up in a striking place. Satin and bunting. On the day of his arrival, he personally led everyone out of the city gate and met in the suburbs. His attitude was much more enthusiastic than when he visited the first army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a great aristocrat in the central region, George Nari and Guy Yrian are naturally also in the queue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that this new king’s arranging is really eye-catching. George is not the first time to see the big steel ship named after the four princes. But after seeing it again in more than half a year, it still gives people a sense of shock. The stone boats that are neatly arranged behind are much more than the last time. The white chimney and the thick smoke are integrated into one, like a column of the sky. When the warrior wearing the uniform of the same color went down the dock, he couldn’t help but feel an envy. If the Panshi family also had such an army for him, let alone the Chishui City, even the Wangdu Hall. The throne in the middle is not to be expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This fool, I really don't know how to open it," George said. "When I was in Wangdu five or six years ago, he was the most uncomfortable." One, let alone compare with a few eldest sons, even his smothered sister seems to be more than him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This does not explain, four Is the prince the one who is the deepest hiding?" The Earl of the Three Rivers shrugged. "It can stand out from the edge of the border and develop to the point where it is today. It is not a fool. You can remember to change your face later." "Try to show your enthusiasm as much as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly know," George replied in disapproval. "With the royal family as an opponent, even if he is really a fool, I will do my best, and you don't have to worry about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At this time, the direction of the pier played a loud sound, and there was a commotion in the crowd - no need to see, I know, the West is in charge, or the new gray castle Roland Wimbledon appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are you going over there?" George asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There have been 51 people," Gay pretended to be a eagerly awaiting the appearance of his squatting, and he did not return. "Two more days." "You can put the rest in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am similar here," he raised his mouth slightly. "It seems that time is full of surplus." The grasp is even greater."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Roland’s move into Chishui City, he and Guy have had many discussions, the most likely one The first thing is to reach an agreement with the lord of the lord delta, and then announce the news of reclaiming the power of the division. After all, Chishui is a big city, and there are many aristocrats around the territory, so it cannot be as fast as Liu Yezhen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering Delta’s indecisive temper, this decision may need to be reversed for two or three days to make, plus waiting for the news to spread, and other aristocratic emotional fermentation Time, enough for them to quietly fill in ample manpower in a few new secret roads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the midnight bell, the rushing into the castle will make the snow powder weapon useless – in absolute numbers and favorable terrain In front of him, Roland Wimbledon is bound to fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is coming," Guy reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George immediately put on a smile and moved forward - the first row of the team is the family member of the lord, and the second row is their big aristocrats. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Delta is accompanying the new king, and he is pleased to introduce the greet. Seeing his round face with a smile that his eyes could not see, and the double chin that was constantly shaking, George had a nausea in his heart. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he remembers correctly, when the Fabio led the army through Chishui City, the lord was also so flattering the second prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, this is the owner of Panshiling, Count of George Nari." Delta finally came to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
