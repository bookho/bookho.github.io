			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the house of Panshiling, the Count of George Nari finally waited for the messenger from the West. He opened the letter and quickly browsed it again. Gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you say on the letter?" asked a fidgeting baron. It can be seen from the river god's family badge on the chest of the questioner that this person is a member of the Leviathan family. His territory is located at the intersection of the river and is a small and famous family in the local area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And aristocrats like him, there are twenty in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be said that half of the aristocrats near Chishui City have gathered here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George looked at the other person coldly and did not answer immediately, but gave the letter to the Earl of Sanhe, Guy Yurian, waiting for him to finish reading. After that, he slowly began to speak. "Roland Wimbledon deprived the owner of the Liuye Town of all powers and took his territory for himself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "New King... Did you really do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell, then the purpose of his trip is exactly what the previous news said, want to take us Are the knights taken back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why? This is passed down from my grandfather!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Liuye Town is too close to the fortress, the scale is not large, does it mean that Chishui City will be like this?" Suddenly someone said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He didn't swallow the king before, he shouldn't swallow it, maybe we should wait and see."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George who heard this sentence could not help but be laughed out. "Is Chishui City far from the West than the Yongyue City? Is your territory more extensive than the entire North?" Are you stupid or stupid? Roland Wimbledon wants to take back all the power of the nobility is not a matter of a day or two - the example of the Northland is in front of you, the businessman’s message repeatedly mentions this matter, now even Liuye Town has become a living proof, but you are still entangled that you are the next hapless?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please pay attention to your wording, sir." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mean and rude remark made the nobility frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me come," Gay waved at the Earl of Panshi. "In fact, everyone knows very well that our new king is definitely not an ordinary person." From the time of distribution to Bianbu Town, everything he did was beyond imagination. It was meaningless to use the previous rules and experience to measure gains and losses. I also asked people to go to the West to inquire, and Roland Wimbledon did not hide his thoughts. The plan is to no longer seal the land, the aristocrats only retain the title... These have basically become the slogan of his business territory, hanging on the square in the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp His peaceful tone eased everyone's emotions. "You may say that Chishui City is not his territory, but the long song fortress is not his first, not to mention the North. Roland Wimbledon will sooner or later become The king of the Grey Fort, by that time, even if he declared that the whole kingdom is his territory, we can only accept it - and this scene is almost certain." Gayton paused. "If there is no land, lost. What are you left with the people?"<b r /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what can we do?" and Huev, who is also a baron with Leviathan, can’t help but say, "Tefco lost and the church lost." Who else can stop his pace? When the Western Army came to Chishui City, everyone did not see how they fought. In a hundred steps, the snow powder weapon would die, and the heavy armor could not. Close, such power is not something we can compete with!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This words caused a sound of reconciliation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course there is a way," George said coldly. "The snow powder weapon is powerful, but it is not without weaknesses. - It requires an open space to display. The bigger the space, the more amazing the power, but the compression into a narrow environment, its role is very limited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Narrow ... environment?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, the Lord's Castle," he swept through the aristocrats in the first place, saying one word at a time, "When Roland Wimbledon arrives in Chishui City, he will certainly enter In the castle - there are not a few guards there, as long as we can send in more people, the situation will become beneficial to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
