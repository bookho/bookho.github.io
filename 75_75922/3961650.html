			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water on the sea line flows into the sea line causing the lower level to rise? How can this be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tillia thought for a while, "When the tide is low, will the sea flow backwards back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Ask well," Thunder excitedly clenched his fist. "After that, my fleet stayed near the sea line for half a month until the tide receded. During this time, I used various methods to cross the sea line, the most amazing. It’s sailing on the sea line – do you know what it feels like? From outsiders’ view, we seem to stick to the cliffs, the sails are completely parallel to the sea, and it is possible to fall off at any time. But we are completely on board. I can't feel this. The courage is like driving on a narrow river with a width of a few feet. On one side is the endless sea wall and on the other side is a wide sky. Of course, you must wait until the water flow slows down. Do, otherwise the magic servant can't protect the hull."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...is totally unreasonable." Tilly felt confused in her mind, if the narrator is not a Thunder But other explorers, I am afraid she has long thought that the other party is boasting indiscriminately.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think so, but I believe my eyes more than common sense." He went on to say, "After half a month, the tide began to fade - - Very punctual, just in line with the timing of the fluctuations of the Shadow Islands. The sea has not reversed, it has slowly retreated, and the sea line has changed back from a few feet to a few dozen feet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean that the extra water disappeared out of thin air?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe, but it may also flow Other places have gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where can I flow?" Tilly helped the forehead, "The tides of the Shadow Islands are ups and downs, and the islands of the fjord are gentle. Many, on the shores of the four kingdoms, there is almost no obvious change - what is it that disappears out of thin air?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder pointed to the foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed. "I remember you said that the water in the shadowy waters is falling fast, just like there is a huge hole in the sea to swallow the sea." Generally, but this hole is even bigger, it should be filled in for a few years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just my guess, after all, no one has ever seen it. What does the real sea bottom look like, but... I care a lot about it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the ocean we are in, why is it called the "whirlpool sea"? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly heard a shock in her heart, then shook her head again. "Impossible, this idea is too crazy. If the submarine cave drainage can cause a whirlpool, we How could it not be observed? And the name was there hundreds of years ago, who knows what the name of the famous person was holding. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed, I have done a simple experiment, the water must be shallow enough to see the vortex, and we have no ability to go deep into the sea." "Thunder smiled mysteriously. "But we don't, it doesn't mean that the witch can't do it. I didn't think about it before, but when you told me that there was a witch empire all over the mainland more than 400 years ago. I realized that the name is likely to have been passed down from that era. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am a witch," Tilly shrugged. "And there is no witch on the island who has the ability to do this." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know one. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This witch is in the fjord, but it has only been in contact with humans for a long time..." Thunder exclaimed. "She used to be a member of my expedition." The deputy friend of the deputy, since awakening to the witch, has forever bid farewell to the land. Now, only when the channel is foggy, can she hear her melodious singing, and you should have heard of her story. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mermaid that leads the navigation road...do you say the protagonist in this rumor? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Thunder nodded. "Although I don't know if I can get her help, I have to try it. Maybe it needs me." Old friend Margaret helped me. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
