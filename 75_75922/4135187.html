			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the diffuse smoke, she captured the goal of this action for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count of Lorenzo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He apparently just woke up from his dreams, sitting on the bed and screaming in his pants, and the warrior who was guarding the big bed had pulled out The short sword plunged into the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice of breaking the wall clearly violates the "warning bottom line" of these shells - as long as the pre-release order is to kill any enemy who breaks into the house, even if The manipulator loses consciousness, and the warrior will automatically respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Betty!" Zoe yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand," the latter followed, with one leg down and two hands in a bowl, "Come on!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-term training and cooperation make the two people have a good heart, Zoe did not even look back, jump directly back -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Betty received her accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With both hands pushing hard, Zoe leaps through this force, flying like a swallow over the head of the warrior, then grabbing the arch The chandelier of the dome is swaying and it is approaching the big bed in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spacious and luxuriously furnished large bedroom provides the lord with a very comfortable and enjoyable space and has become the stage for her performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zoe raised the shotgun directly in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time seems to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight of War is still turning, but apparently it is too late to keep up with her pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty is back to the big bed, posing a victory posture - this problem obviously comes from the dream world, what a real man never looks back at the explosion, what is the style Combat aesthetics... I don’t want to think that it’s all magic effects, it’s fake. However, looking at her only half-length, still pay attention to the movement of the sacrificial samurai, Zoe is too lazy to care about her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Count of Lorenzo, he looked up in horror, his eyes full of incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the time of firing a shot to the present, it’s only a few tens of seconds. For him, I’m afraid I have never thought that the defense line formed by the warrior will be so fragile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chandelier was scattered directly under the pull of Juli, and the burning candle fluttered like a flash of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in the fire, Zoe aimed at the target and pulled the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boom--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a loud noise, time has resumed flow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl immediately raised a layer of blood fog! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty steel balls from the top down, almost completely covered him. Under the powerful impact, he even sagged first, then stretched up and bounced, and when it fell again, it was twisted into a ball like a rag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Zoe’s feet were on the big bed, and the devastated bed frame was finally unable to withstand and shattered, and the bang crashed into A broken piece of wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the disciplinary samurai also suddenly stopped moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Besides the landing is not perfect, the other action is full." Betty whistle, "If there is a pair of sunglasses, it is better."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zouy gave her a sigh of relief, "Recycling the body and then talking nonsense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes "Yes..." Betty shrugged and pulled out a small model corner from her waist pocket and blew it to her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From now on, I am your new owner." Betty cleared her throat and said in a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six godly warriors Qi Qi clenched his fists in the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's only limited to returning to the winter before. When you get to the third side of the city, you will be thrown into the storage room for everyone to choose - if you look good If you have a chance to see the sky again, you will only have to wait until you are scrapped. Of course, I think you...the hope is not big." Betty half joked, even though she knew that these shells would not react at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the magic has destroyed the self-consciousness of the original owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zou opened the bronze door and saw many guards at the end of the corridor coming to the lord's bedroom, and the upstairs and downstairs were also rapid footsteps. Obviously this short battle has completely broken the silence of the night, and the entire castle area has entered a state of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See the guys in armor?" Betty smiled. "Go and kill them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice just fell, the gods of the warrior rushed out from behind her like a beast, holding a sabre toward the guards, and in the other horrified eyes, the sword blade into their chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle is like a boil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first army soldiers opened the way, plus the cover of Shanghai grid, Joe entered the dungeon Did not encounter any twists and turns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he saw Farina hanging on the armor, his chest still slammed like a hammer, an indescribable pain Tightened his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radiant woman, at this moment, is like a dead wood that has been sucked up by all life and is unable to hang on the chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to see a smooth skin on her body, and the whip marks from the shoulders are spread from the shoulders to the legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back and chest are the most important areas of devastating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A group of red and swollen marks are flowing with concentrated water, apparently a wound that has not been properly treated after being burned by a soldering iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the fact that the torture is still going on, even if she suffered such treatment, she did not choose to surrender to Lorenzo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe trembled and walked towards her, feeling that every step was so difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accompanying soldiers reacted more quickly, and they stepped forward to unlock the chain and release Farina from the arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the person you want to save? Don't be there, come and help!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah... yes..." Joe was as awake as he woke up and asked Farina to put her flat on the grass couch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier seems to be ready to take out a bunch of bottles and cans from the backpack and start giving her emergency treatment - even though Joe doesn't know the potions It all has a role, but from the gradual breathing of Farina, they are at least effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he assisted in the bandaging, Farina suddenly gave a sigh and opened her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How... will be you..." she muttered. "I am dreaming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is not a dream, everything is gone!" Joe held her face and whispered back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Are you?" Farina was a little bit. "I understand. I am already dead, right? So I will see you in the dungeon." ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly raised her hand and touched Joe’s cheek with twisted fingers - Lorenzo not only unplugged her nails, but also Her fingers were broken at one root. At the moment, it was more like a withered branch than a hand. "Sorry, I have not been able to continue the church... to live up to your expectations..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
