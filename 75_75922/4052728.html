			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventy-sixth installed a somewhat timid appearance, slightly turned his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get in touch with the Witch Alliance, they will inevitably be subject to their censorship, and she is prepared for this. No one knows more about the witch's ability than the federation. A large-scale organization has the means of detecting such as perceptual magic and insight into the god stone. Normally, if this is impossible, she will not rush to the gray fortune. The West is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the loss of the gods of the psychic, she can easily control all parts of the body, and can control the retraction of the defensive field - any one As long as the witch is practicing for two or three years, she can skillfully use this technique. As long as she does not provoke the magic to create a distorting barrier, she looks just like ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, the sorcerer’s field and the blue blood of the sacrificial warrior are caused by magic, and in the absence of consciousness, they are shaped like beasts and can only rely on transformation. The instinct of the instincts to fight, naturally do not know how to use the omnipresent magic. When the witch's soul enters, the body is fully utilized. Although it can no longer condense the magical cyclone as in the past, the battle instinct will disappear, but the soul that has acquired eternal life can pass the year after year. Training to make yourself possess the power and skill that is no worse than the extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't... ask us about our abilities?" Anne paused for a while before she could see that her alertness had been mentioned. vertex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seventy-sixth is equally interested in this issue. She also had a deeper understanding of Anne’s experience along the way. I heard that this witch is capable. The defect was rejected by an organization that only accepted the fighting witches, and was almost sold to the nobility by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a good understanding of the battle witch’s high score on the 76th, especially in the case of the wild witch being crushed by the Star City, able to protect and protect the organization. It is itself a necessary means of maintaining continuity. But it can also be seen that these witches' understanding of the magic is still at the initial level. Because of the existence of high-order awakenings, some non-combat witches can get earth-shaking changes after they are promoted, and the seemingly tasteless ability can undergo transcendental qualitative changes. Therefore, the bloody teeth will not only accept non-combat witches, but also sell them to the nobility. It is stupid to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the same is not too much ability and too strange, it can be said that from one extreme to the other extreme, after all, high-level awakening is always a small probability event, a lifetime The witches who are unable to advance are more than a cow, let alone the fighting witches also have opportunities for promotion. So in any case, the higher status of fighting witches is the real situation. Their approach of equal treatment is simply unbelievable on the 76th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that Anne will be wary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ability test is usually arranged after three days," the red-haired witch laughed softly. "After all, you are running all the way, you are definitely tired, or wait." It will be more accurate to test after a good rest. What do you say? Right, my name is Wendy, who is the head of the Witch Alliance. I can ask me if I have any doubts in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie’s look still has no relaxation. “So if the test results show that... our abilities are of no use?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His Majesty, Roland, or the Witch Alliance, agrees that "there is no incompetent ability." The witch who claims to be Wendy is still gently replied, "I know what you are worried about, and this is where most witches join the Winter City." The process of going through. In fact, the ability test is just to let your Majesty know you better. It doesn't mean you have to be a part of the league. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie couldn't help but see, "What do you mean?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It means that even if you don't want to work for your Majesty, you can live in the city like an ordinary person. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence makes the heart of the 76th slam, she knows that the emergence of high-level witches relies heavily on a relaxed environment, such as in the tower In addition, each witch can perform as much as she wants, and the potential will be specially cultivated by the federation. The more the witches dominate the holy city, the more high-level abilities are promoted.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a witch who flees around, a sorrowful witch, even a small chance of practicing ability, how can he be promoted? If it is true, the winter city can Let the witch's free and stable life, in a sense, have the conditions for the birth of high-level witches.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
