			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third side of the city, the core hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland took a group of people just out of the narrow underground passage and heard a hysterical scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Wendy is awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mourning of Cabradabi," answered Felice, who led the way. "After learning about the defeat of Erskuk, it completely collapsed. Not only did it react to the normal state of silence before, but also tried to commit suicide many times. It took us a little effort to get it to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suddenly felt that letting it live Not bad." Tilly received a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The current situation is that it must be alive," Felice nodded without disguising. "The discovery of this secret letter is an excellent opportunity. Let us understand the enemies more deeply, and even master their language and words - and this is an opportunity that the Federation has been craving but has never been able to get."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I didn't expect Cabradabi to cooperate with you." The nightingale exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it doesn't. This process is a bit complicated...you will naturally see it later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people walked to the interrogation desk and saw that the body of the godly warrior, who was occupied by the high-level devil, was firmly tied to a standing metal bracket, and the abdomen was inserted into the pipe. Its eyelids were forcibly opened, and a stack of papers filled with weird text was placed in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is... A letter that Axia reproduces?" Wendy asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I found that the location is in midair. If it’s not the tip of the wheat, everyone almost missed this crucial scene.” The answerer is love. Gesha, her face looks pale and her eyes are slightly black. It seems that she has not rested for a long time in order to interpret the information on the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning that the battle was over, Roland sent the Winter Detectives to the front line the first time to help the army collect news that was difficult to obtain by usual means. This clue that is left unintentionally is much more reliable than the words that are revealed to humans on the plain side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the limited magic of Axia, the initial backtracking mainly focused on the sniper squad and the enemy's battle, and how the sorcerer laid out the ambush and deceived Hill. Dimensional observations on these points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the feedback received by this initiative far exceeded his expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t expect that the second day before the decisive battle, Erskuk sat on the giant skeleton and wrote this letter to the sunset. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene is also accurately recorded by the scene backtracking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, ——————!" Cabradabi screamed again, it was desperately twisting his body, struggling to seem to want Partially open the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha nodded to the side of the wind, the latter slammed the foot, the high-order devil immediately closed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that you use the wind to control its actions and force it to watch the secret letter?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then, with Ms. Carmela’s spiritual connection, I repeatedly felt the first reaction to seeing the text.” Celine added, “Although this guy is interested Confuse your own consciousness, but as long as you change the text content and compare it many times, you can determine which thoughts are true and which are fictitious. To be honest, think of this method or trust the blessings of your Majesty."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?" Roland groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You wrote in the intermediate biology textbook, as long as the dog sees the meat, whether it eats the meat into the stomach, it will secrete a lot of gastric juice. And this conditional response is a ubiquitous feature in living things - it seems that the devil is no exception now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is through this method, We can piece together the contents of the letters from the high-level devil's mind that is completely uncooperative, and then understand their words. Without the assistance of Ms. Kamila, I am afraid that this process is still in the foreseeable future." After she finished her sleep on the island The big housekeeper shook the main shrine to show his thanks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the witch, the ability is diverse but full of limitations... Roland thinks that the unique characteristics make each of them unable to copy, and the lack of a certain key ability may not be able to wait for hundreds of years. In the past two battles of divineness, perhaps not the witches who appeared similar to Camilla Darry, but they are likely to be untimely. When the awakening, the whole situation has fallen into disadvantage, and human beings are no longer able to grasp the high-level of life. The devil is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is based on this that Ersruk focused on the elimination of witches. But... can the value of Ashes, Sylvie, and so on, in the eyes of the devil, really compare with Takira? The obelisk needs to be built by the Shenshi vein. Once it is occupied by Takira, the ever-increasing red fog can cover the gates of the desolate mountains. At that time, the beasts can easily cross the mountains and invade the hinterland of the four kingdoms. Humans want to drive the devil out of the fertile plains, which will undoubtedly be hundreds of times more difficult than it is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the unanimous view of the General Staff and the Tacula ancient witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do the two sides judge that there is such a large deviation, perhaps the clue is in the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, let's talk about what you cracked out." Roland slowly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the sentences are put together after the interpretation, so The content of the letter is not complete, and it is intermittently read, but this is enough for everyone to understand its meaning. As Celine directly reflected the restored statement into his mind, Roland could not help but create the illusion that the other party was whispering in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord of the Sky, the decisive battle is coming soon... I am fully prepared, whether it is against the enemy or against myself." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the last month, I have heard the call of ... more than once. The signs are so clear, maybe I will be promoted in this battle..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that this will bring you criticism, but it will not affect your West Line plan."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If successful, the enemy will lose the means they rely on... and we will regain our advantage in the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... ... Ten times more troops, human beings must have no chance to win..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this battle is not without suspense, if I fail..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please treat human beings as opponents that are evenly matched with my family, and annihilate them with full force, even if you give up the bottomless land."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "... As long as we can get their inheritance fragments, we still have the hope of defeating the heavens and the seas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Finally, please represent me to Wang and nightmare Adults pay tribute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Erskuk’s entire letter was displayed, Roland felt a cold sweat on his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally knows why Felice is so anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the results, the other side is undoubtedly a failure - it not only failed to slam the team, but even buried itself in the hands of the ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also means that the situation is directed to the second hypothesis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are still some incomprehensible things, the whole sentence means to look at it. It seems to be advising the people to give up the confrontation with the Tianhai world. Human beings are first-class enemies, attacking and destroying them all? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell... what a joke! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland suddenly felt pressured by the mountains - this is probably the worst news since the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The development plan for the fertile plains, I am afraid I have to give up." Wendy muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the enemy is all overwhelmed, it is really too risky to set the neighborhood outside the desperate line of defense."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
