			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland failed to stay in the bedroom all day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near dusk, he received a nightingale notice, and Tilly wanted to see him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland had to put on his coat, bundled his long hair, and took a stack of manuscript paper to the office. After pushing the door, Tilly and Ashes have been waiting for him in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his heavy weight in his hand, Ashes took the initiative to meet him and took over the thick manuscript paper for him. This move made Roland feel a little surprised, he did not expect To this extraordinary person who has always looked at his own dissatisfaction will also take the initiative to help one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunset from the floor-to-ceiling window reflects the wall in orange-red, while leaving a golden rim on the two, quite a bit of a taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has roughly guessed Tilly’s intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is some disappointment, he knows that the day will come, and the other party has no choice but to leave without saying goodbye when he is in a coma, which is enough to show sincerity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am here to say goodbye to you," surely, Tilly said calmly. "I have to go back to the island to take care of the bloody teeth. Question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Tilly’s good face and the reflections of the sunset, Roland was silent for a while before he said, "I understand... When will the Beauty Beauty arrive in the West? I will let the kitchen prepare a dinner for you - wait," he said suddenly. "What? You will come over?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash can't help but hold his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly directly smirked out, "Why, don't you welcome me? Brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No, I mean... how are you..." Roland opened his mouth in surprise, but for a moment he didn't know what to say. After the song was half-sounded, he came up with a sentence: "Because the demon moon?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't deny it if you think so," Tilly said, "but you have no higher expectations?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is completely stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the "does"," Tilly said bluntly. "I will bring back the news of your victory and go back to the island, and tell them that the winter city in the west of the Grey Fort has completely shaken off the threat of the church. You don't have to worry about life anymore, and you don't have to hide here. On the island. When you are ready, I will settle here with a witch who is willing to go to the West. I hope that you will not suspect that they have eaten too much. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Roland, there is an inexplicable excitement. "Westland welcomes them at any time!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can live in so many witches in your building," the five kings showed a sly smile. "Even if only half are willing to come, there are more than the witch alliance." Several times. And most of them are not fighting witches, I plan to wait for the demon moon to pass and then hire a ship to transport, then the route will be much safer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed, "I will build enough housing before the spring of next year, which is not a problem for Karl." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, I have three additional conditions," Tilly reached out with three fingers. "I hope you can promise me, brother." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing her serious appearance, Roland couldn't help but sit upright," you said. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, if they want to leave the winter city without going to other towns, you can't limit their freedom." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem," he replied without hesitation. "But now the Grey Fort is not yet unified. I can't guarantee that the other people will treat the witch equally." For security reasons, I suggest that they temporarily settle only in the West and the Sleeping Island. When I can control the whole kingdom, it is not too late to leave the West. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just assumed it," Tilly nodded with satisfaction. "Secondly, if they are not willing to work for you, you can't force them." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
