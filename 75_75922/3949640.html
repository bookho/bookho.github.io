			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter’s recent days have been particularly fulfilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White paper is like her name, quickly absorbs knowledge about witches and magic, and the progress of literacy and natural knowledge education is very smooth. I can learn new vocabulary by referring to the literacy textbook alone. It’s just a little troublesome for natural tutoring. The little girl sometimes asks questions. Even Wendy can’t answer it. In the end, she can only ask Anna or the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axia is a lot more clumsy than white paper, probably age relationship, a word has to be repeated several times to remember the spelling, for nature The course is also a variety of doubts. However, Wendy did not care. If they were all smart like Anna, then it was called a blow. What she lacks most is time and patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting up every day, she will call the two people to the living room to check the homework arranged yesterday - this is also the view that His Highness has preached to all the teachers of the Ministry of Education: only If you don't learn, you will soon forget that you can always keep in mind when you practice. Wendy is deeply impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is magic practice, this white paper can already help Ai Gesha to make acid, or go to the shipyard to help cement accelerate hardening, so Wendy counseling The object is mainly the newcomer Axia. I heard that she will join the Security Bureau in the future to help His Royal Highness reproduce the crime scene, so the most important thing is to accurately control the playback time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to display is as good as breathing for the witch. Even those who are slow, as long as they can feel the magic running, they will not be worse. Wendy often pulls the wheat stalk out as an example, encouraging Asha not to be frustrated by the low natural power, even the pigeons can evolve, let alone a normal witch? Of course, afterwards she will secretly bring some honey sauce to the wheat bran as compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night is a routine elementary education class. Considering the difference in the progress of the new entrants, His Royal Highness has divided the Witch Alliance into two classes. The original person continues to teach by the book and begins to learn the elementary physics and chemistry. The new awakened are trained by Wendy. - After the normal course is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the most relaxing moment of her day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, as a co-defender witch who first joined the league, after a period of study, Wendy has opened the gap with several sisters in the forefront, thinking He was also given the responsibility of the Alliance Manager by His Royal Highness, and he felt the pressure on his shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when teaching new people, she can put down the burden and devote herself to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two arranged the evening homework, Wendy went to the bathroom to take a hot bath, and returned to the bedroom in a comfortable way, but saw the nightingale sitting. On the bedside, holding a "Theory of Natural Science Theory" in a daze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can only be a daze, if she has to focus on the book, she will fall asleep in less than a quarter of an hour - Wendy I have never seen her insist on watching a quarter of an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Wendy uncovered the quilt and climbed onto the bed and sat next to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nightly, she looked at her slightly, and her face was so empty that her heart could not help but tighten her eyes. She only saw this in Silver City. That is, the day when I first met the nightingale. At that time, she walked alone in the snowy streets, completely ignoring the snow covered shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Roland is with Anna..." She whispered. "I pushed him."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Wendy didn't know what to say for a while. She also recently saw that the relationship between Anna and Her Royal Highness is obviously close, but everyone has defaulted on this, so Not surprised - as the first witch to be contacted by Anna, Anna is impeccable in every respect. Apart from being infertile, the book even thinks she is the best person to be a queen. I just didn't expect this change to be caused by the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I made it clear that I knew that this was the inevitable result. I can see how they look when they are together. Why... Why do you feel so uncomfortable? "The nightingale clung to Wendy's hand. "I have made up my mind..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at each other's appearance, Wendy also felt Uncomfortable, the nightingale gave her the greatest impression is that she is strong, whether it is the hand in the silver-light city to imprison her distant relatives, or to fight the church in the co-help club, no matter what kind of predicament, she can calmly fight, even in the face of aggressive Carla, she did not reveal fear. But in the face of feelings, she changed back to the helpless child again, and at this point, she could not help her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
