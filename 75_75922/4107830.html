			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you agree that I have the ability to fight the devil?" Luo Jiadun came to the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never denied your eligibility to fight with them. In fact, even ordinary women who have no hands on their hands will invest in this. There was a huge war in the field - behind the big line of defense." Roland reiterated, "I am opposed to fighting alone with them. This time, if the sleeping island witch is coming later, there is no symbiotic species in the sun. You may have been buried in the Western Cemetery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if it is not, no winter city can not find the devil army." Luo Jiaqiang said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can reward you for a good result, but I can't affirm the wrong way because of a good result." Roland shook his head. "You did the most." The correct thing is to bring this news back to the Winter City, instead of staying in the wild and fighting with the enemy. If you ask me the same question now, my answer is still no - I don't want you alone. Going to the devil, and this time I will make the goalkeeper look stricter, saving you from returning to death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"诶?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the command of the great chief!" Roland is unmoved, "Talk about rewards first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hey..." When she first touched her ear, the look of the big chief was not so serious. "That's alright."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are three rewards Kind, you can choose one. In a nutshell, it is a golden dragon, a chaotic drink and a custom equipment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two Easy to understand, the last one is what? Are iron claws or steel teeth specifically for wolf form? She did not consider similar problems in the mad flame clan, but she always changed back to the original, and those special weapons would easily become burdensome to carry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia asked the doubts in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The specific plan has not been thought of, but it is roughly a powerful firearm that can greatly enhance your combat ability." Roland explained, "I Listen to the ashes and say that you can keep the body part of the wolf. In this case, the power is equivalent to half a god penalty. This set of equipment will be specially designed for the gods, but I think you should also use it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is he talking about, the weapon used by the first army that defeated the oasis watchdog? She remembers that there is also a hand in the lightning, the power is amazing, but also depends on the operator's ability. Moreover, the "弩 arrow" used by it is very special, and it can only be produced without the winter city. According to the previous statement of the Grand Chief, since she is not allowed to leave the city alone, she will certainly not send her the corresponding arrow. If there is a firearm itself, it can only be placed in the house at most, and it will not play much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, she believes in her body and fangs more than external forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I choose to join the Witch Alliance?" Luo Jia said after a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party probably didn’t think she would answer this, slightly screaming, “But yes, but you were not...”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I changed my mind," the wolf woman shook her tail. "The day when Jinlong always used it, the chaotic drink will have a moment to bottom out, and I have nothing to do except fighting. Joining the Witch Alliance is better. If you become a member of the Alliance, there will be Golden Dragon and Beverages issued every month, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...It’s not like this Wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, I have promised lightning and wheat, and I want to explore the whole wild land with them. Since they are all members of the Witch Alliance, then I join It will be more convenient to act later. Right, if you are traveling with them, you should not stop me from going deep into the wasteland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough In theory, it is still important to be safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So this is the reward I want," Luo Jia First, "... After all, I have rejected your kindness before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call," Roland finally spread his hand, "If you decide." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
