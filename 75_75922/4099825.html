			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that this question would make him think for a long time, but did not expect to get a quick answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why..." Hyde groaned, "Because you are a witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The magic string does not jump. It turned out that the nightingale suddenly understood a lot of things, the witch is the devil's minion, the incarnation of the fallen, once become a witch, it will gradually lose the feeling of being a human being - then the argument is deeply rooted in the heart, knowing the moment she awakened Perhaps in the eyes of the other party, she is no longer a member of humanity, let alone the relationship between her brother and sister. The so-called betrayal is nothing but a way to protect yourself. Hyde still thinks so. It is because he completely believes in his own judgment that he will answer so naturally. Afterwards, Hyde also said a lot. For example, he used to be ignorant and ignorant. He did not know that this was the filthy word fabricated by the church. For example, now it has been painfully repented. I hope she can forgive herself... but the nightingale did not listen to these words, and the thoughts in her mind were like a storm, which made it difficult for her to return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she shouldn’t blame the other person, just because most people make the same choice? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, he is not betraying his own sister, but a devil who will lose humanity sooner or later? Since it is a devil, there is no trust in each other, and it can be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes... is that true? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, when asked about Hyde, her consciousness unconsciously drifted to another person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is also a nobleman, let alone blood, never seen once in a row, if the betrayal of the witch is a matter of course, then he should have sent Anna The gallows are right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is neither fear nor hate to the witch. In addition to curiosity, his eyes are clear and easy to understand - even if she has threatened to attack each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene of the scene flashed quickly, as if going back and forth, and finally stopped at the moment before the heavy snowfall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first winter after they met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I don't think she can't live the month of the demon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She said she would not lose to the demon phagosome, and I believe her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You actually believe in a witch, we are cursed by the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? I believe in you too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea of ​​memory sways with this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale takes a deep breath and pulls consciousness back to reality. "Wait here, if someone comes to you, what to do, how to do it, then I have never been there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, etc... Where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She inserted the dagger back into her waist and hid in the fog, "to accomplish what I should do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Hyde said, she can invade Dortmund’s bedroom, and use a dagger to force him to say everything from the beginning to the end. Most aristocrats often scare their souls when they see the sharp knives. They ask for a sentence and only hate that they have two mouths. And some of the more stubborn people, after being picked up the ten fingernails, will also dump the secrets with joy, which she has already verified many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the death of the parents is really related to the Viscount, she will naturally let the other party understand what the blood debt is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not stay overnight, but don't want to do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now she is no longer alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has people who can be convinced and trusted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the practice of the Shadow Killer in the past, she wanted to try another way to solve this incident - if it was Roland, she would not want to see her. Excessively contaminated with unnecessary blood, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the foggy world, a few of the nightingales entered Dort’s study, and a few black holes were like ink balls. In the black and white world. She did not care about the guards who were sleeping by the door, but instead looked at the field of stone in the bookcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly walked to the wall, and the straight wall was twisted, the contours were bent and curled, like a bunch of hair that was lost. Expose the things covered underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the contour of the deformation, she saw the details that ordinary people could never see - a piece of thin metal rod was buried under the wall, and a section was connected The bookcase, while the other section is connected to the "black ball." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very common institution secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale easily destroyed the bell hanging under the organ, and then pushed a seemingly unpredictable book with almost no sound, and the MiG secret door was opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hidden box is embedded with the stone of the gods, but this is hard to beat her - before she was still a year ago, the old mouse called the mouse She passed on the abilities of a qualified thief to her. After several years of tempering, she has mastered the skills of how to open all kinds of locks with copper needles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After opening three or four iron boxes in succession, the nightingale found what he wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a recent book that records the batches, objects, and quantities of the Dream Water deal – just as she expected, the nobility always likes Their important objects are hidden in places that they think are hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this record, plus the goods that have not been shot in the house, the evidence is conclusive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale returned to the basement and reported to Roland the whole story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sky was white, the first army that had been ordered to come was surrounded by the government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, the nightingale appeared again in front of Hyde, who had just come from prison It was released, and the slyness and sorrow on his face almost made him like a corpse. Until the nightingale was seen, a trace of color appeared in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anger and hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Viscounts of Somalia were sentenced to hang, the rest of the family served for 20 years, and the two blocks were owned by the kingdom - you let me wait to wait "The result?" Into an unmanned alley, Hyde could no longer restrain his emotions and whispered to her. "Take me everything and make me feel nothing?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should be thankful that you are not considered a member of the Somé family," the nightingale calmed. "At least you are alive compared to the Viscount."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's just because you want me to continue to suffer, look at my jokes! It was like this eight years ago, now it is like this...you kill the old Geeran Got it, know what kind of life I lived after! I finally had the opportunity to get the Somalia territory. I thought you would help me, but you ruin it!” Hyde clenched his fist "I don't have a title or a land today. Are you satisfied? You have never forgiven me, Veronica! You A liar... All you want is revenge! I should have understood it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, his snoring brought a cry, then The song rolled up and whispered. "Nothing... I have nothing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night was silent for a long time, "No. Wrong, I didn't forgive you, and I will never – the more I was born with the same origin, the more I couldn't forgive the betrayal.” She paused. “But you are not nothing, at least I gave you freedom.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
