			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does this mean?" Roland looked at the animal skins on the table with a blank expression, and asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time his heart is very angry, the devil not only embarked after the attack, but also left a retaliatory declaration, which is simply against the winter city Naked provocation. But the more this time, the more he knows to restrain himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officials looked at each other and no one dared to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to being unwilling to face the anger of the king, the meaning of the pattern painted on the skin is also the main reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge wolf-shaped creature is undoubtedly referred to as Luo Jia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other few are painted with human beings, bundled witches, burning walls, and corpses and ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the lines are so simple, they can be seen together but they are very easy to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a threat letter expressed in patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Hand over the wolf woman, lay down the arms and surrender, cover the murderer, and insist on resisting death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland swept through the officials in the hall, sighing out and trying to calm down. Although not everyone will reveal a look that is not good enough, and even some individuals have shown coziness, but fortunately no one has proposed to hand over the witch to the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, the other party wants to convey the meaning is not simply intimidation or persuasion, but a trap!" In this repressed silence, a light curtain Spreading on the wall, Pasha's voice passed into his mind. "I have learned from Sylvia through the process. Please don't believe every word the devil said. This is their usual practice!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her tone is a bit urgent and seems to be worried that he made the wrong choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roland also heard some embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you ever encountered such a thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly, it was The mortal kingdom." Pasha said solemnly, "During the first war of the gods, the devil used this method to separate the connection between the mortal and the witch, and step by step to eat the light."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the narrative of the ancient witch, Roland quickly understood the meaning of the "trap". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the era of ordinary humans and witches, the devil will exert pressure on the opponent from the side, besides being aggressive on the battlefield, such as surrendering the witch and suspending the attack. such as. Witches are a minority at ordinary times, and there is no need to hide their abilities, so it is easy to be screened out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to save their lives, those witches occupy a weak position in the city, they often choose to do so, so some witches have just fought with the devil on the battlefield and returned to the camp. I am captive or killed. In such a situation, the existing gap between the witch and the ordinary people gradually intensified, and what led to the further deterioration of the situation was an inhuman betrayal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the Battle of Divine War, the lords of the two central cities formed a coalition army to fight against the devil. The difference between the army is that one is dominated by witches and the other is It is composed entirely of ordinary people. In a fierce battle, the ordinary lord suddenly fell to the devil, cut off the witch army on the way to the retreat, and used the stone of the gods. The witches who have lost more than half and are exhausted, despite the final resistance, are still annihilated, their leaders are beheaded, and the living witches, except for a small part of them, are left to the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This betrayal was called "the break of the next day" by the later federations and regarded it as an unforgettable lesson, that is, from that day on, humans gradually differentiated. It became two ethnic groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the city that surrendered to the devil did not last long, and the surrender of the witch was only the beginning. When the enemy’s outpost continued to advance, reaching out to reach the land of the lords They will not hesitate to flatten them. The human prince who launched the next day's break was no exception. He built a fog tower in the city under the direction of the devil, and sent people to help the enemy build a post and provide intelligence... Even so, he could not enjoy his old age. It is rumored that he was imprisoned by the devil in the castle of the lord starving to death. Others said that he knew that the devil wanted to destroy the human race and escaped from the territory, but was killed by the vengeful witch... In short, with the end of the war of gods, humans also Losing control over the light, most of the territories became an insurmountable restricted area, and the red fog that lingered on the skyline was a nightmare for all escapists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
