			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unpacking the wooden box reveals the "gift" inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clearly a coffin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good pair of coffins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is gold foil or lacquer, it looks very delicate, the pattern on the cover is a black short whip, it is the battle of the iron whip clan Pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubaka. The blood whip was stunned first, and then could not help but sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it? I thought they would put something that would scare me more," he shook his head. "Head, ears, human skin... ...this is the practice of Tieshacheng. Coffin? The southern part of the country does not need this extravagant thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead here are all thrown into the desert, then at high temperatures Bake down into white bones - no matter what the status in front of you, there is no difference after death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the northern talent needs a wooden box that is so tweaked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you die, you have to shack yourself, like a cage forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aosha’s nephew thought it would scare me? He took a sigh of gas and worked as a slave for a long time in the Grey Fort. I am afraid she has forgotten the threat of the sand people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this insult still makes Lubaka feel bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get my axe!" he shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a family who immediately resisted a cast iron axe, the handle was nearly one person high, and the dark axe had a head size - although he was a whisker clan The patriarch, the favorite weapon is the heavy tomahawk. Whether it's fighting the beasts in the desert or the heads of the challengers, it's so witty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of absolute power, any blockage and parry is meaningless, as long as it is in the middle of the arm, even wearing the northern armor is a blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It certainly drank the blood of the Aosha clan—women and women, and children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He forgot to tell Zall Silvermoon that those who were exiled did not arrive at the Endless Cape. Because he rushed to the front of the escort team in advance, and then killed them in the yellow sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that they will be able to retaliate back one day. He simply enjoys the pleasure of this killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coffin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to fucking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lubaka spit, shouted, raised the battle axe with both hands, and swung down against the cover with the iron whip. —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“咔嚓!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of Mars emerge from both sides of the axe, like 劈What is the iron stone thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coffin was not split as much as he thought, and the touch from the handle told him that this exquisite wooden box was never empty - - It is stuffed with things! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sparks, a more dazzling light blooms from the inside of the coffin, and then instantly fills the entire hall and quickly expands outward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lubaka didn't see it all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the light passed over his body, his eyes and tongue had been crushed and torn in the rapidly expanding air, followed by his skull. , limbs, internal organs...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an earth-shattering loud noise, all the residents of Tiesha City saw this incredible scene! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the wall peeled off, then the column and the roof. The falling stones accelerated the eruption of the smoke. The collapsed stone fort made the column of smoke rush to the sky and merged with the gray sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron sand city seems to have a "Tongtian Tower". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram in the Oasis Tavern also saw this scene, until now, He only understood what the story told slowly before the iron axe was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coffin filled with snow powder, the weight cut by the goddess, the meteorite attached to the cover, the cord connected to the top of the board...whether it is violent destruction The coffin, or the normal opening of the cover, will attract an unparalleled Thunder. Although he is not quite sure what the snow powder and the fuse are, he is still aware of the Thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to spread the muffled sounds in the numbers and the smoke columns observed in the blood-stained places can be imagined how amazing this innocent thunder is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he did not lie to himself, the scene in Tiesha City was really caused by the coffin, and the chief of the iron whip should not be alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Thuram didn’t expect that the other party would really start with the fourth-ranked Iron Whip clan before the duel, and still retaliate in such a blatant way. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." He looked at the iron axe that looked like the first time, and he couldn’t say a complete sentence for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Lubaka. The blood whip tainted the sacred duel and lived up to the expectations of the three gods. For a person who has lost the duel qualification, I am again How could it be fair to compete with him in the burning place?" Iron Axe said calmly. "Lubaca and his people are just a group of cowards. I have not used them as a duel opponent from the beginning." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...the iron whip is a big clan after all..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of this, this way The ending is more suitable for them, not gloriously fighting in the ring." The iron axe shook his head. "Under the circumstances, the Aosha clan does not violate the rules set by the Three Gods. Once the opponent surrenders, we will take up the weapon, wide. "The life of the duelist." He said that he paused for a moment. "Think about it. If you are the chief of the Iron Whip, know that the Aosha clan is back, what do you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram immediately understood the meaning of the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that destroying a rule can destroy the second time, and a passer-by who does not follow the rules of the Three Gods will bring them endless troubles – Even if you want to reverse the "success" eight years ago through the sacred duel, you will inevitably smash the opponents before and after the duel, and it will be better to crush them from the beginning. It is better to guard against it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...if Lubaka didn't open the coffin and didn't destroy it, wouldn't your plan not work?" Thuram's head There is only one last question left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Iron Whip is violent, loves destruction and killing - guessing his actions is no more difficult than teasing a monkey." The iron axe rises slightly The corner of the mouth," and the snow powder coffin is just an appetizer. Even if Ruba is lucky enough to escape this level, there are still many gifts waiting for him. But now it seems that the Three Gods will not bless it. The traitor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram couldn’t help but shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was loyal to Zall, Silvermoon and the New Aosha clan, he also swore in the name of the Three Gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence of the iron axe is also a warning to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we can talk about business," the mixed-race patted him on the shoulder. "I have another reason to pick you up." Because you know the iron sand city very well. Listen to the people in the oasis and say that there are no things in the desert that you don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just stayed here for a long time." There are more stories to hear," After a night of defeating the watchdog and easily solving the Iron Whip clan, Thuram became more respectful to the Iron Axe, the Princess of Aosha and the Grey Fortress behind it. "But If I know it, I will definitely go into detail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
