			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day after McMug left, Roland took the witches to assemble a new generation of hot air balloons in the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the back garden and the witch dormitory are being expanded, the leaves have moved the plants into the vestibule. All kinds of vines are covered with walls, wooden frames and corridors. They look quite a bit like the feeling of prehistoric forests. The sunshade effect is also very obvious. The sun can only pass through the dense green leaves and leave scattered on the ground. Light spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland handed the witches a stack of white paper, letting them spread out into a huge piece of paper, and then Soroya painted the lightest blue sky coating. Compared to the combination of bovine suede and canvas used in the original hot air balloon, the pure coated fabric is much lighter and has excellent toughness. There are no sutures at the joints, and it is not too afraid of air disintegration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Listen to the lightning, there may be witches coming over the fjord?" Wendy asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If all goes well," Roland said the contents of the five kings' reply. "The specific situation has to wait for Tilly Wimbleton's reply." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that they are successful," she thought, "there are so many witches on the island."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, I’m afraid that Tilly has planned this migration for more than a year or two," Roland said. "Not only the Grey Fort, but the other three kingdoms have sent witches. In secret contact, the co-help club should have received her invitation. I guess this is why the guards spread the rumors for so long, but there is no reason for the witch to come to the door - after all, it is a step slower than Tilly." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hakala has never mentioned this to us," Wendy licked her shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If she tells you about Tilly's invitation, maybe you will not insist on finding a holy mountain again?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is indeed this possibility, but as a result, we will not meet in Bianbu Town," she shook her head with a smile. "So it is not bad."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also feel pretty good," Lightning is a hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, maybe it’s better to go to the fjord," Lily grinned. "After all, there are witches, not like a door in the town." Pay special attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s been much better than before," Anna said seriously. "At that time, I didn't dare to go out at all."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, some people are like this, obviously the last time Ashes refused to come when they were invited, and they pretended to be pretending," the mysterious moon muttered. "I also said that I am not a traitor!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Lily's eyes widened, "Stupid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Treason! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other witches couldn't help but laugh out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too," Roland felt that there was a sense of accomplishment in his heart, and he was better than the cleverness of the five kings. Feike and Garcia are as strong and decisive, but at least, he can give these witches a free and comfortable living environment, and also bring a better life to the people under the control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This hot air balloon... I’m afraid it’s several times bigger than the last one,” the nightingale looked at the part that Soroya had painted. “You Are you going to use it to transport witches?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded. "The only way to avoid the harbour city is to go directly from the seaside at the southern end of the town. And Picking up new visitors, it is also a new attempt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two sides of the paper are coated, they become mezzanine fabrics, each of which is nearly six meters long and wide. - If it is conventional canvas or linen, it has been difficult to drag with one hand, but for a light coating, it is almost the same weight as a stack of paper. A dozen pieces of fabric were spliced ​​together, and the seam was glued to the joint to create an amazingly large airbag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland wants to test, it is the adhesion of the Soroya coating. At least at the beginning of her new ability, the half-painted "thick bark" on the table made him remember. The two are firmly bonded together, pulling the bark up and even lifting the entire square table. How close the paint can be to the base layer, whether it can support a huge airbag, and maintain its firmness and airtightness after inflation, which he wants to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
