			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest advantage of the Seagull is that there is almost no noise when accelerating the flight, which is very suitable for ambushing opponents from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the glider traversed the clouds, it circumvented the peaks like a ghost, quietly approaching the back of the battlefield - at this point the defense line of the squad has been completely washed away. The soldiers can only fight each other and fight back. If you change to other military forces, now you are facing a situation of losing unified command, I am afraid that it has already collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the situation of the First Army is still not optimistic. Once you lose the advantage of firepower, you want to eliminate the spiders who also have the means of long-range attacks. The price will be paid. Multiply, not to mention the black devil who is like a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the lookout mirror, Andrea now has a clearer view of each other's appearance - apart from the armor, exaggerated and weird armor In addition, it also holds a huge long scorpion, how to look like the image of a heavy warrior. But the other party's agility is far more than the knight in the charge, but can change direction at any time, as if the armor and weapons on it are not heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Andrea, this is also the most difficult opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the distance now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1,900 meters..." Hill Wei’s tone is full of tension. “How can I hit?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No,” she licked some dry lips. “I have to stay closer. A little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, Andrea has quietly launched several abilities, and the coincident silver lines in the field of vision change from the original one or two. It can be seen everywhere - this means that she has more than a dozen methods to get a shot out of this must, as long as the goal is enough "fit". Once she pulled the trigger, the drop point was announced, and within a few seconds of the bullet flight, no one knew what the other party would do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a normal firearm, she can shoot continuously, using the number to eliminate the probability, but the large-caliber sniper rifle in the hands is very different, she can not take valuable The stone of the gods is going to gamble on this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safest way to do this is to compress the flight time of the bullet as much as possible, so that the target tends to "stationary" during the interval from the shot to the hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1,500 meters!" Hillville couldn't help but grab his own clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Seagull turns, pay attention to the roll!" Wendy reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This distance has been able to distinguish the glider and the large raptor with the naked eye, although on the fierce battlefield, no one will pay special attention to the movements in the sky, but all the witches The hearts are hanging up, even if they know that the enemy can't hear the sound from the sky, they still slow down their breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1,300 meters!" shouted Hillvi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little closer!" Andrea placed her finger on the trigger. One second is more than enough for most of the goals, but this time the opponent is the Maharajade's devil, she does not want any accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1,100 meters!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeil, pay attention to the angle of the pressure bar, I I can't pull it up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nine hundred--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, Andrea launched the ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless silver lines filling almost the entire field of vision, and finally converge into a dazzling beam of light - within this distance, the influence of wind direction and gravity is minimal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"WYSIWYG." She whispered softly, then pulled the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, the sorcerer also perceived the vision through the reaction of the soldiers of the First Army. It slammed back and found that it was over the top of the head. Glider - At the moment when the fireworks of the muzzle emerged, the stone warhead of God's punishment has already flown to the front. Even if it's quick and quick, it's too late to dodge again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Successful?” Wendy asked eagerly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi’s face was a bit whitish, “No... I’m afraid I didn’t hit the enemy just now.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come," Andrea bit his teeth and slap a piece of magical bandage on his shoulder. "I clearly saw it when I fired it -"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi didn't know how to answer for a moment, her ability could not penetrate the shield of the stone of the gods, so I couldn't know what happened in that moment. But she did see that just as the black light of the Shenshi warhead was close to the demon's moment, the surrounding scene was slightly distorted, as if something was between it and the warhead. Then the black light suddenly broke into pieces, instead of penetrating the target's chest straight as in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't fight, what about the target?" Sawyer interjected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It... got up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi said hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the eye of magic, she saw that the attack had left a few obvious scars on the black armor, which should be caused by the shattered stone. The most obvious damage is the head - half of the towering minaret helmet of the sorcerer is shattered, revealing a half-cold face below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the cause of all this, the other party can still stand up and explain the result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silvi, help me load!" Andrea shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have no gods and penalties..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That would be normal, She insisted, "Since the demon can still mobilize in this situation, it is not meaningful to be a stone warhead, as long as it can be played out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The sky is overcast!" said Sawyer. "Is this guy endless?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi will be half-armed long" The bullet "pushed into the gun," but it has now noticed us, and then try again -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I have to fire this shot!" Andrea whispered, "If you run away like this, I am afraid I can't fly out of this cloud area!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer who stood up again Oh, the red light in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dull thunder rolled across the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Loading is complete!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wenty, steady direction!" Andrea Aiming at the target, the silver wire once again connects the target and the muzzle. This time she ignored the sting of her shoulder and did not hesitate to pull the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably aware that the danger is coming, the demon leaps to the side and flies down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Sylvie finally saw the true face of those twisted things -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They are thin and transparent, like a piece of flaps, but that is by no means a true flap. Under the magical shape, they are better than any blade, and spontaneously hover around the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the bullets are empty, they still react, with a few pieces flying directly to the path of the warhead, and the rest are The devil's body formed a blade wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blast of the blast once again appeared and ignited a snow mist, and the distorted golden stream light also smashed the sky at this moment, crushing the gull Left wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glider suddenly lost its balance and rolled to the foot of the mountain-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the shadow of the god of God is overlaid on the mountains of the desperate mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
