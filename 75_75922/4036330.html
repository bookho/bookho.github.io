			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside of the tent snorted, lying on the floor and dazed the nails turned around, saw the thick curtain being opened, the iron axe bent over Into the canopy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Finger, commander," he did not expect that the commander of the first army would come to visit himself, and quickly sat down and salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to pay more," the iron axe went to the ground and sat down in front of the ground. "How is the injury?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no big problem, just broke two teeth," the nail touched the still swollen cheek. "It’s not so painful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "That's good," the iron axe nodded. "Miss Nanawa is basically busy these days. The injured ones can only be recovered by themselves. After the rescue is over, you can go to Baron Pine." Proposing to repair the teeth, the First Army will pay for this fee for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can fully understand that this little injury does not bother her. After all, Miss Nana Wa is also very hard..." Speaking of this nail a little hesitant, "I don't know the hound dog..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hound is snatched The long gun in the hands of his teammates, the one who stunned him to the ground, and the other side’s sight of a long gun aiming at him is still fresh in his memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, he has nothing," the iron axe comforted. "The moment he was armed, he was thrown down by the guards, plus attacking teammates." The behavior is not voluntary, but forced by the ability of the pure, so there will be no punishment. Now he has returned to the team to participate in the training."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is it..." The nail sighed. "At the time, I thought I was dead. How about the other teams?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the pre-war arrangement, each The bunker has arranged two machine gun teams and a five-person guard team. Even if the enemy approaches the bunker, they have the ability to stick to the spot. Except for two or three people in charge of carrying ammunition in the opening group, everyone else wore the stone of God's punishment. I thought it was a foolproof practice, but I still thought that there was a flaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was more or less such an accident," the iron axe said. "But it didn't cause much harm, or we wouldn't stand." Here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the church repelled?" When the words were just exported, the nail realized that it was an idiot problem. "Hey, I want to ask." What happened after that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy launched the final charge, but never crossed the fourth trench. Whether it is the gods or the trial The army was completely defeated. They left more than 2,000 bodies in front of their positions and then fled... We won the final victory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes the nails puzzled is that the iron axe does not show much interest when it comes to these things, but it is mixed with an indescribable sense of weight. But the other party did not say the reason, he did not dare to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is a long silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the commander sighed and patted him on the shoulder. "Since there is no serious problem, you should take a rest first, I will go. Look at other injured buddies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the iron axe is about to leave, the nails have the courage to stop him, "Adult..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I... I want to leave the First Army." He whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" asked the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I may not be a machine gunner," the nail slammed his head down. As long as he closed his eyes, he always thought of the man in red robes. The young woman was swept by a machine gun. "In this battle, I did not decisively fire at the enemy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the goal is a minor Pure, right?” The iron axe interrupted him. “Your team has reported to me in the post-war summary. I don’t think your idea is right, but it’s not a mistake. Now I Just want to ask you a sentence, are you going to abandon your squat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
