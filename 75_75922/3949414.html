			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather in the fjord is very strange. Yesterday was still a cloudless blue sky, and today it is dark and the wind is thundering, and a storm is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes held down their blown hair and walked into Tilly’s home. At first glance, they saw the giant pigeons lying on her shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"麦茜?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕!" The pigeon raised his head and his eyes lit up, Zhang Open the wings and rush toward the door, and the ashes reach out and easily stop the other person. "Become a human figure and talk again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜...咕," McMug flutters On the ground, the feathers are faded, revealing the original appearance, and the mouth screams, "Do you hate pigeons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I always feel that a big bird can speak very strangely. "The ashes smiled and pulled up the girl sitting on the floor. "When did you come back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was afraid that I would be in a storm, The wings are quickly broken," she patted her chest. "It’s better to fly to the island before the rain falls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are like this... ...flying back?" Ashes hold their foreheads. "Why don't you become Haiyan's appearance, isn't it going to be much faster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...," Mai Suddenly Rubbing his eyes, "I forgot you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tili couldn’t help but laugh out, she put down the stationery in her hand, "Working hard, over there I already know the news, you should go to Lotus and Molly to play, and then I will notify you when I think about how to reply."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good 咕"Mc茜 jumped out after the ceremony." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does Roland W. Burton say?" There were only two people left in the room, and the ashes went to Tilly’s side to sit down, her front A map, carefully looked at it, seems to be a topographic map near Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is his letter," Tilly handed her a piece of paper. "I have to say that the witch he picked is really...special." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash quickly read the letter and couldn’t help but frown. "He actually chose Sylvie? Is this not at all meant to be debunked?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," Tilly said. "Maybe my ability comment is so vague that he didn't go into it at all? Or he doesn't mind." Show your identity in front of us to show the sincerity of cooperation? Of course, there is still a possibility..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is really your brother," Ashes answered. So I don't care about Hilli's ability at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this possibility is minimal," she laughed and laughed. "My brother is who, still Does anyone know better than I know? If it is really Roland Wimbledon, he will never choose to be an enemy of the church in order to protect the witch. Small to big, what he is best at is escaping, whether it is facing challenges or difficulties... Even if he is transferred to the Bentham, he has never seen him protest to the "father", even if it is symbolic. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash picks an eyebrow. "In short, it is a good thing for us to pick Sylvie on its own initiative, so there is no need to make an excuse to send more witches." Going out, but a few other witches... Do you really want to promise him? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lian is one of the most important witches on the island, and if she is gone, who will repair those clay houses? If you want to build something, or transform the terrain of the island, the ability to reshape the terrain is extremely inconvenient. After all, we have used less than 30% of the entire sleeping island, and there are many places that can be transformed," she said with a finger. "Honey is also, she can drive the Osprey to fish for everyone, and the delicious food that everyone enjoys every day." The fishing rod is her credit. As for the candlelight and Evelyn, there is not much problem... Can you refuse his request and change to two witches who don’t have much effect? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is useful and what is useless?" I sent them to Bianbu Town in the hope of forming an ally with each other instead of abandoning them." Tilly's look is a bit serious. "No matter the ability, the sisters who choose to come to this island are witches. If you want to build a sleeping island into a witch's home, how can you screen them according to their ability? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
