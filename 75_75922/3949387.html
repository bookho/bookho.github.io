			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman took back the short sword, put the needle eye down on the ground, picked up the medicine bottle and rubbed it on the body, and handed it back to the priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job," Faye nodded. "Take him out and dispose of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes," she uttered a hoarse response, but when she dragged the body, it did not seem to be laborious. It was not like an old man who would walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, do you believe what he said?" After the manager left, Shattrath asked the officer, "The caravan and the witch are mixed together, or Out of the appointment of the Bianbu town lord - if I remember correctly, is the lord not the fourth prince Roland Wimbledon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it true? I have to check it before I know it," Fei Li said with a serious face. "But I think that he is not likely to lie. As long as he looks at his eyes on the wall, he can notice the movement of the fugitive. If He wants to make up a lie in exchange for the holy medicine, at least it is difficult to verify."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I immediately sent someone to review," the official of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, find out what news is immediately reporting to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the table and sat down, playing with the holy medicine in my hand. These refugees are already in his bag. In order to control their movements and avoid their own escape, after the spread of the evil, he instructed the dream water to send rats into the refugees and spread the news that the church is about to save them. As long as they endure for a few days, they can not only receive the redemption of the gods, but also be accepted by the church and become a part of the gray kings. As for the latent mice, most of them are infected with the evil plague. In exchange for the Holy Spirit, they will spare no effort to do things for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the mouse’s intelligence is correct, the group is transporting the fugitives at least since yesterday, and according to this situation, it seems that not all of them will not be stopped. Equivalent to seriously hindering their own plans. What's more, they are still in the same league as the witches. Fei Li believes that it is a witch who can cure the evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, the body has been handled." The old woman walked into the secret room with a light hand. "Are there any fallen people?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten have **," Fei Li said, "and maybe more than one." He paused. "There are no outsiders here, no longer need to dress up as ugly." It looks like it’s boring.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bent down Then, the whole body screamed and sizzled, as if the whole body bones were rubbing, the body shape grew rapidly, the gray hair turned black in the blink of an eye, and the wrinkled and loose skin gradually tightened, becoming tight and elastic again. - Time seems to flow back on her, and when she re-stretches her body, she has become a beautiful woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is much more beautiful," Fei Li smiled with satisfaction. "I remember this person is... the one who was hanged at the gate of the city?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, adults," she nodded. "In four people, you spent the most time on her."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really... know how to please me," the priest grinned. "But Shattrath is estimated to be coming soon, and time is not enough." He pressed his heart. Want to fire, "and those who fall need you to deal with - just like before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give it to me, adults," Tao, "I will not let go of any fallen witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, Shattrath returned to the secret room. He first looked at the witch, and then reported to Fei Lihui: "Adults, there are indeed a lot of people in the escaped private land outside the West Gate. I am afraid that the darkness will not be clear, and I will let the hand move the torch below. Many tents are empty, but there is no trace of fire in the dock area. It is not clear whether the caravan is still stationed, as for the witch..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Checked," Fei Li interrupted. "Since the other party dares to transport the sick fugitives, the information of the rats should not go wrong. As a result, this group has at least two witches, one in the air. Surveillance, one person can eliminate the plague. Especially the latter, the threat to my plan is huge, we must stop them." Now the other side is pulling people outside the city, in case they bring the witch into the city, openly treat those infected The city people, the "Holy Spirit Pharmacy" that they promoted, became a joke! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
