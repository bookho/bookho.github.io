			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This place is still so broken," the fortress ambassador Pelos stepped out of the cabin, a decaying smell of wood rushed to the surface. The air around it is damp and dull, making people feel uncomfortable. He sucked his nose, raised his head, and the sky was gray, and it seemed that a heavy rain was brewing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you last came here, it was a year ago," the assistant eagerly put the woolen coat on the ambassador. "There is nothing here, except the stone." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was a year and a half ago," Peero corrected. "The Duke adults will draw different people every season. When I last went to Bianbu Town, it was still summer. And in addition to the stone, there are all kinds of fine fur, and..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The assistant showed a blank face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perro shook his head and did not answer. He crossed the ship's side and stepped on the pier covered with moss, and the sound of the board under his feet creaked. Probably still for a few years, the pier will be fragmented, he thought. Bianbu Town has not only stone, fur, but also... land. But these are meaningless. The assistant is just a document that the City Hall has not seen in the past. I can't see this at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a large undeveloped land between Bianbu Town and Changge Fortress. On one side is the desolate mountain, and on the other is the Chishui River, like a narrow corridor. As the outpost of the fortress, if you take responsibility for the defense line, a large part of the land will be included in the fortress. They are not cultivated, they can be planted many times without fallow, and with the natural barriers on both sides, it does not take much effort to eat. This can just alleviate a series of problems caused by the increasing population of the fortress. Bianque Town will also become a fortress, rather than being separated into two separate territories as it is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only downside is that it takes three to five years of operation and a large amount of upfront investment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, in terms of the predictability of investment, most nobles are not as good as a lame businessman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, how is the yard empty?" Helping the fingers in the distance, "Would they not have the ore ready?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perro sighed softly. "Let’s go to the castle to see my highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait... Mr. Ambassador, don’t you wait for their reception team?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s there, he’s thinking but not saying, “Go Well, the horse is right in front."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the trouble of splitting into two separate territories is apparent, and the king’s squad has thrown the four princes into this remote place. What will a normal aristocrat or royal disciple do? Of course, it is all about this place. Let the ore and jewels change for food and bread? I am afraid that I can only see the Golden Dragon in the eyes of the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is himself, it will do the same. I see that the output in my territory has been exchanged at such a low price, I am afraid no one is willing to accept it. Moreover, the prince does not have to go to the fortress. Most of the people in the family have forgotten the fact that the Chishui River is not only a long song fortress. He can sell the ore to Liuye Town at market price, sell it to Longling Ridge, sell it to Chishui City, and then take people to these places to take refuge – nothing more than a little further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what can a long song fortress do? Block the river and cut off the prince and his party? That is simply against the gray castle royal family! Everyone knows that the four princes are not liked by the king, but it is no doubt that he is also the blood of the king. This is beyond doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two rode on the rented horse and walked slowly along the riverside stone road. There are some old horses in the stables. They are mixed in color and skinny. Even if they are slow, they will tremble when they walk. For the two idiots, he had to pay two gold dragons as a deposit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, sir, is that the boat in Liuye Town?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the assistant Hey, he looked in the direction of the other side, and saw a single-roofed sailboat with green leaves and a machete banner slowly coming down the river. The hull has a high water line, indicating that it is full of cargo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pei Luo nodded blankly, but his heart sank, and the other side acted faster than expected. If the prince has already started to contact the towns in the lower reaches of the Chishui River, he will have one less chip in his hand. He originally planned to lobby his father to agree to buy ore at a price lower than the normal price of 30%, so that there is still profit, not to mention the jewellery that can be multiplied several times after being polished. Unfortunately, this monopoly business is not his decision, nor the honeysuckle family has the final say. There are six aristocrats participating in the mining industry in Bianbu Town. Without the majority consent, no resolution can be formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
