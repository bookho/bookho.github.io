			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explorer is still the swaying dress, full of feathers, and the right eye is wearing a blindfold with rose petals, how can you look at the makeup alone? Linking him to Thunder himself, but somehow, Roland always felt that the other party had a slight deviation from the image at the banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you pretend to be a person, you need to devote yourself wholeheartedly, even thinking that you are the person, you can deceive the eyes and ears of others, this is when I learn to disguise The first sentence of teaching." Thunder sucked a pipe, and the faint red light was like a looming firefly in the dimly aisle. "Your Majesty, I am afraid I can't concentrate on playing Sander. Birds... She will see it. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original feeling is from this, Roland thought, because there is a certain danger in adulthood, so he can no longer pretend to be a Unrelated outsiders are indifferent to their daughters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is concern, then it is not Sander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to keep hiding like this?" Roland raised his eyebrows. "You just heard the lightning, and she is destined to go." The path of the explorer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question silenced the Thunder for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Roland thought that the other party would not answer, he opened his mouth. "Your Majesty, do you believe in fate?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a moment, Roland had some doubts about the identity of the Thunder explorer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn't this the classic starting style for preaching? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, similar questions are also common in high school students' love letters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the other party is obviously not trying to find out the answer. "Someone told me that superiors tend to die in what they do best, and God wants to make up for it. There will always be an unparalleled talent for this type of person - this is fate, a road that is destined to be deceived, because of its extraordinary talent, and then it is tempted, and eventually it is degraded. On the contrary, those who have average ability will usually live more. Long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who said this?" Roland couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sand is also the person who introduced me to the path of the explorer." Thunder took a cigarette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, is there such an explorer in the fjord? Are you afraid of lightning hearing his name?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has been dead for many years, unknown before his death, and after death... According to the standards of the fjord, he can't even be regarded as a real explorer." The smoke is surrounded by the thunder. Blending with the shadows on the wall, "When he died, he couldn't find a brand new island, or an unmarked route on the nautical chart. Sander didn't care about his fame. He said that the adventure itself is a species. Fun, lack of talent, nothing bad, at least don't worry if it will be short-lived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland seems to realize what, "How did he die?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Death to save me." Thunder slowly said, "The ship encountered a sea ghost attack, and Sander slammed me when he dragged me back into the cabin. The wound was not big, but the herb was ineffective. The flesh and blood quickly rotted and there was no breathing after three days. At that time he told me that he still He died in what he is good at - he has no other advantages in his life, the only thing he is good at is self-consideration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."Roland Suddenly I found that I didn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After the birth of Lightning, he showed great talent in adventure. Whether it is identifying the route or drawing a chart, her learning speed is faster than the average person. Much more.” When Thunder said these words, his face looked extremely complicated. “When I learned that she was awakened as a witch, this worry rose to the apex. You should know what this ability means for the explorer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, if courage, curiosity, and curiosity are still hidden human nature, anyone can provoke it, then magic can only be said It is the gift of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I made this decision," Thunder looked up, and the light in his eyes seemed to echo the red light in the pipe. "If fate is hard to avoid, I Maybe you can cut it off in another way - if I can catch the veil of the unknown land before the lightning officially embarks on the path of the explorer, the chances of her encountering danger will be greatly reduced. Occupy the site, there is still no one to walk through the place where only the east of the sea line and the ruins of the shadow sea area are seen. When you defeat the devil, I should be able to draw a map of these two places, and Before that, I was still better at acting alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
