			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland opened his eyes and found himself lying on a soft bed with a familiar ceiling on his head, and every crack coincided with the appearance in memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is your own...bedroom? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and looked to the shoulders on both sides - either left or right, looking intact. Trying to move your hands, there is no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he knows that this is by no means a dream, and the fact that the devil and the attack have been attacked are already happening! Being able to lie in the bedroom safely means that they have escaped the pursuit of the devil and returned to the castle smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, isn’t all the witches safely coming back? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Roland couldn’t help but sink, and he stood up and his arm felt a weak feeling of weakness. I just wanted to make a call, but I saw a row of witches at the end of the wall facing the bed, with Anna, Nightingale, Lightning, McMug and Nana. They leaned against each other's shoulders, breathing smoothly, and their eyes closed slightly, as if they were asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland quietly unveiled the corner of the curtain and found that a morning light outside the window was rising from the bank of the Chishui River, like a dazzling gold wire spilling over the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You...wake up?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning, Anna doesn’t know when With her eyes open, she knelt her eyes and walked to Roland step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I woke up. Other witches..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are safely Arrived in the town, in fact, only one of you was injured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Roland sighed. "That's really good--" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A fool."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no time to retort, the other party has already hugged him tightly The deduction is in the hands of the back, and almost wants to be embedded in his flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anse’s move awakened the other witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stood up in surprise and came around, lightning Two hugged Roland, followed by Nana Va and McMug, and the nightingale hesitated, and everyone fell into the arms from behind. In this way, everyone is in a group, and for a long time they are not willing to let go... Time seems to be fixed at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After eating breakfast, Roland listened to the details in the office before he counted Find out what happened in the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witches defeated the Devils in pursuit, and let Lightning and McMug bring themselves back early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were taken back to the castle to receive the treatment of Nana Wah. The broken arm quickly compounded as early as possible, but due to severe blood loss, it was a full day of sleep, so Today is the fourth day from the departure date. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This action has always been a bit of a big deal. He didn’t expect the devil to find a hot air balloon with sky camouflage more than ten miles away. Listening to Sylvie’s statement, the huge multi-eyed demon had nothing unusual before, and the eyes were looking in all directions, but when she moved her focus to the multi-eyed demon, the other party immediately responded and instantly took all Eyes are aimed at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of investigation is unheard of, knowing that at this distance, in addition to the real eye of Sylvie, even the lookout mirror is a blur, plus There is a red fog above the upper minaret, making it harder to see the specific conditions of the devil. Correspondingly, the other party should also find it difficult to find out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, although the trip encountered major risks, the information collected was also extremely rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
