			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that is a long silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna’s eyes are not as calm as he imagined. In the silent dialogue, there is an undercurrent in the blue lake, and there are concerns. There is fear, but more is determination - because of this, her expression can be so firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling is getting stronger as time passes by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland finally realized that he might not have been able to convince her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, but you have to promise me a request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is any accident on the battlefield..." Roland licked his lips. "I mean, in case, I am unfortunate..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I really have such a thing, I will leave the North immediately," Anna bluntly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but hold it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you worried about revenge on the church, and finally send your life?" She rubbed his cheek. "Night and ashes are possible." I will return to the West as soon as possible, then bring all the people who are willing to follow you to the sleeping island, where I will take root and continue to fight against the Holy City. Your Majesty, although I also want to stay with you, I know that you will never want to see it. It’s about this.” She paused when she said this, “so I can promise you that I will continue to take you down until the world you want has not arrived, until the witch and ordinary people can live together freely. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't answer, and didn't need to answer... Anna's growth has passed his imagination, which is the best reward for his coming to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached out and untied Roland’s button. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is no longer necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two kissed and fell over the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black fire pulled down the curtains, and put the clothes and the bedding to the side. The fate is firmly connected at this moment, as evidenced by the stars of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, Roland made the last speech before the expedition in the square. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who heard the news crowded the square. After a year and a half of exhibitions, the past Bianbu Town no longer existed, replaced by prosperous The busy winter city, the people's life has undergone earth-shaking changes, and Roland's reputation has risen to an unprecedented height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My good deeds, good morning," he boarded the podium and ushered in the overwhelming cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live the king!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Longevity of Roland!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for echo to do care, and no need for any agitation. People consciously and enthusiastically make a full of respectful voices, waving their hands like a surging ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, the sound gradually subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should already know," Roland looked around in countless double-respecting eyes, and said in a deep voice, "The kingdom will usher in a self-defense against the invaders." In the war, the enemy is the holy city of Hermes that has swallowed the winter and the wolf heart! Now the four kingdoms only have the gray castle and the morning sun survived, and now their goal has been aimed at us!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that some of you have believed in the gods and believed in the church. This is not shameful! Your kindness is used by people, your expectations are deceived, don't I blame Liars and robbers, instead blame you as a victim? Of course not!" He raised his fist. "The price should be paid for. The church is right! It’s just selling the stone of God’s punishment. They Earn hundreds of thousands of golden dragons every year - and that money should belong to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
