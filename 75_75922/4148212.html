			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lights in the backyard were removed, Roland saw the witch in the report in the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t look too big, at most 16 or 17 years old, her hands and feet are slender, her body is thin, and she has obvious signs of malnutrition. Although it has been cleaned and treated, the light brown short hair is still as yellow as straw. The most striking thing is that the black cloth blindfold on her face, even if it has been replaced with a new system, is quite incomparable compared to the younger appearance of the five senses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Ma, she is Momo." Wendy said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound seemed to wake her up, and the girl hurried down and tried to push her head down as much as possible. "By, see the country, the king's majesty." —”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Pull her up.” Roland put down the drawings in his hand and replied in a gentle tone. “No need to be nervous, this is not a formal occasion, no need So cautious. The reason I am looking for you is very simple, that is, I want you to show me the ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-arranged Momoton showed a panic Look, "Your Majesty...this...I am afraid..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that not everyone is satisfied with their own limits, even getting dissatisfied The answer will be angered by people.” Roland said comfortably. “And I just want to know a result, no matter what it is, I will not blame you. I can guarantee this.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of practice, this kind of thing should be put after Wendy’s ability test, but the other side Special ability too, so he'll be tempted heart really curious - in fact, the battlefield for Angelo's soul, he always had a guess, but never been able to prove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, he finally waited for a chance to verify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty..." Momo gritted his teeth. "Don't you be afraid of it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knows that if he is a former one, he will never take the initiative to ask such a question. The so-called mediocrity is self-interesting, knowing how long it will take to live is undoubtedly a problem. But the more he stays on the throne for a day, the more he feels that his responsibility is great, and the mindset of the ordinary is no longer suitable for today's situation. If the other party's description is not wrong, predicting the age of itself is an extremely precious piece of information. Putting it in another world can be called a "opening machine". It is a pity that it is only a heavy burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these thoughts can't be understood even if they say it, so Roland just smiled. "Even if I am afraid, it will not exist." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momo clenched his fists and took a moment to nod. "Since you ask for it... I am rude."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty," Wendy took a deep breath, "please let me retire first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stares at her For a moment, "...I thought you and the book were the people you most want to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't be as calm as you are, but like a book That's it – no matter what the outcome is, we will support you to the end.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door closes, Roland leans over, “What about you?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momo stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that still used?" Then the nightingale appeared behind him, making the girl scared. "All you want, I want to know, no matter it is Good or bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really two people with different personalities... Roland laughs, “Get started.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Momo’s stunned eyes looked back and forth several times before and after the nightingale, and finally he took off his eye mask like he made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she looked up again, a red glow appeared in the empty eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be the eyeball of magic, which is particularly strange in the deep scars. Roland can imagine how it overlaps with the eyes - if in later generations This peculiar pupil must be sought after by a large number of people, but in this era, it is not unusual to be treated as a devil's eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
