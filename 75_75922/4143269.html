			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After nearly a week of real flight test, the Cavaliers Academy has taken a crucial step from scratch, and the training for the preparatory students is finally on the right track. But its impact is far from being limited to the college. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, some people noticed the "huge kite" hovering over the Nancheng District that day - although Tilly occasionally drove the unicorn to pass the lord The castle, but most of the time will be selected in the no-man's land for testing, plus the people's natural awe of the castle area, so that most people have only heard of the existence of the aircraft, and have not witnessed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no such concern in exchange for the Air Knight Academy. The curious people went to the South District, surrounded by the road, waiting for the plane to rush out of the wall. For a moment. At the beginning, it was limited to residents in the vicinity of the Shoal Port and the factory area. However, with the rapid spread of the news, on the third day, the surrounding area of ​​the college was surrounded by a group of “people who eat melons”. Whenever an airplane appears in everyone's field of vision, there will be a loud voice and exclamation in the crowd, as if you are rushing to the blue sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honey is more accurate in the title, with the title of "Miracle Reproduction", with a large-scale coverage of the ongoing assessment test in the college, with a double wing The clear and close-up of the machine instantly brought the sales of the "Graycast Weekly" to a new peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no such thing as a wave of acquisitions in the winter city. It was a realization of the business opportunities that existed. After the weekly report was sold, many foreign businessmen began to pay high prices. When you buy newspapers from the public, if you don't have enough funds, you can pick them up. Even the photos of the planes are hand-painted, which makes the market expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this round of vigorous turmoil, the name of the empty knight finally spread throughout the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also got a summary report made by Tilly a week later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the 197 preparatory students, a total of 150 were approved, that is, a total of 47 causes occurred during the entire assessment period. A crash caused by an operational error. Considering that there were only four pilot aircraft in the first batch, it was equivalent to an average of more than eleven times per aircraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may sound unbelievable, but Roland knows that these aircraft are simple in structure and light in weight, and can be repaired quickly as long as they don't hurt the engine. In addition, most crashes occur in the landing stage. It is not too slow to shoot on the runway. It is too fast to break the landing gear and stop by the friction of the belly. Such damage is common in the biplane era. It is a good opportunity to drag back to tinkering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the patched aircraft is not as good as it was when it was shipped from the factory. Tilly also mentioned that the current status of the two aircraft that can fly is greatly reduced. To meet the training requirements, in order to ensure the quality of teaching, the college urgently needs a new batch of biplanes. In addition, due to the improvement of training content and the expansion of follow-up personnel, four aircraft have been unable to meet the requirements. In terms of comprehensive training efficiency and actual needs, at least 12 to 15 or more are required. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the number of a flying brigade in later generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland found that regardless of the fact that the report was viewed horizontally, there was a word in the line - "I, the Air Force, fight money."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After laying down the report, he shook his head in a dumbfounding, only to say that Tilly did have this talent, just saw the essence of the Air Force in the initial stage. In fact, if you want to form a qualified flight unit, you must have a large population to be screened, and there must be enough planes to fall. Both are indispensable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now no winter city is in urgent need of manpower, a large team of aircraft can not be realized in the short term, can only let Anna slowly come together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to Tilly, the General Staff Department also submitted an observation report written by Isis Kant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report is very short, but the content is quite interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northland Pearl believes that as long as it is used properly, the Air Knight will have the potential to change the situation of future wars, and even become the decisive force for winning and losing. She hopes to draw a group of people from the General Staff Department to set up a research group and enter the college to understand the performance of this new weapon so that it can be used in subsequent planning. At the same time, she also conceived some tactics that only the empty knight can do. He wants to have a separate detailed discussion with Roland, and the emotion he can't wait for can be said to leap on paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as Roland intended to call the North Pearl to talk about her views on the Cavaliers, there was a voice of the guard outside the office. "Your Majesty, Minister of Construction, Carl Vabert, asks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the phone and took it back again, "Let him come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty," Carl walked into the office and respectfully performed a ceremony. "Your "Miracle Building" was successfully completed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the main body below the podium, Roland really felt the spectacle The charm of the word.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took nearly two years before and after, and tens of thousands of Golden Dragons were enough to build the steel of the three Chishui Bridges and the hills. Concrete has finally made the building finally completed. If it is not the help of witches such as lotuses and hummingbirds, it will consume several more manpower and resources.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The spectacle of the country is not just a banter, but in the same way, when it is built, it will be absolutely unbeatable for the people who have no winter. This can be seen from the people who come to see the completion ceremony in all directions. Out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called gap is more clear in comparison. Compared to the surrounding two- to three-story residential area, up to 56 meters The Miracle Building with fifteen floors is almost a unique show. Even if it is used to the high-rise building of Roland, the heart will not endure. It’s a sigh of relief.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a new landmark without Winter City, it’s not a simple and useless face project, but a combination of new technologies. For the water supply and drainage problem, Karl adopted the method of setting multi-level water tanks on the floor to solve the problem of too high a height difference and no water pumping.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are four external "elevators" installed in the corners of the main building. They are driven by the steam engine in the basement. They can carry dozens of people to and from the top floor and the bottom floor at one time. Although they are not as smart as modern elevators, they must be Arranging a special person to control the operation, it is impossible to stop every floor, but for this era, it is still a stunning design. In particular, the lifting ladder uses a large number of floor-to-ceiling glass, while overlooking the city, fully called It’s a kind of enjoyment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, say a few words," after boarding the podium, Karl stroked his chest, "Your people are Waiting for your appearance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded and walked to the fence and waved at the crowd below.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crowd suddenly gave a warm cheer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people who have no winter city, good afternoon. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today is the day when the Miracle Building was built. It has created the most of the world, and history will remember this day - but I want to say it here." It’s not how great it is, but what you care about the most. Who will live with it? Or...what is it built for? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Noble? No, the Grey Fort has cancelled the power to divide the aristocracy; the royal family? Of course not, I don't need such a big place to put my bed. The answer is actually very simple. That is the inhabitants of the Winter City - that is, you all. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You created the Miracle Building, and you can enjoy this miracle without a doubt! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Each room will be clearly priced in the Executive Office, no privilege, no need for family life, as long as you bring a resident ID card, you can apply for a purchase, stay This building is destined to go down in history! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, and there was a deafening shout in the crowd.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Long live! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live without winter city! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the sound was a little bit, Roland continued to sing. "Now, I will light the torch on the roof. When the night falls, it will be raging." Ignite and become the most dazzling star in the winter without sky! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
