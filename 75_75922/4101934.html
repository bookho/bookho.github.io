			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forcing Dunn’s actions with the First Army found that he still underestimated the strength of this group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the battle to the defeat, the people on both sides did not even touch it directly. Uncle Sang, they just kept on fire for the morning squadron. There was no rain and no rain, and there was no sweat and blood in the battle. In the long line of more than one mile, he could not see anything. However, from time to time, the other side’s lineup has fallen from time to time, as if it is in line with the movements here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the war seem a bit of a play, like an empty drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the screams from the side of the boulevard know that it’s just his illusion, the easier the first army is, only More and more prove their strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally understood what the nail called "the way the first army battles". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team of hundreds of people acts like a person. When it is silent, it is like a ghost. When it is attacked, it is silent. Everything is implemented according to the plan. Its discipline is almost unprecedented. Compared with those weapons with amazing lethality, Dunn felt that the Northland garrison was not inferior - with the cover of the night, the ambush was in place on the eve of dawn; the five squads were all in battle, there was no supervising team behind them; the eagle as the conductor Instead of staying in the camp, instead stay in the ambush circle closest to the old holy city; everyone is highly concentrated and clearly defined, and every order can be executed quickly... If it weren’t for these details, even with fierce weapons, I’m afraid The way to achieve such a victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After witnessing the full battle, Dunn couldn’t help but be glad that he had chosen to leave Hermes in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have been staying in the Holy City, wait until these guys break into the city, I am afraid that businessmen like him will be treated according to the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether, he sighed secretly, it was too dangerous outside, if this time he can safely go back, he is still doing business in the city of Everlasting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is not much money, it should not be a problem to support a family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a "Human Heaven", should I miss him too? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really hope to get home soon, Dunn thought. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ******************* <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp In the evening, the eagle entered the tented tent and made a military ceremony to Itis. Then he handed a booklet. "The battlefield has been cleaned up. This is the report of each class. I simply summarized it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Working hard," Northland Pearl took over the booklet and looked through it from beginning to end. No casualties in the First Army were expected. In the morning, more than 1,000 bodies were found, and more than 600 people were injured. The direct reduction was estimated at around 20%. There were not many guns that were killed. Most of them died from bombing and self-destruction. The sweeping along the way only exacerbated the chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also in line with the inference of the staff, after all, the number of troops stationed in the North is too small, the magical Ark cannot transport enough ammunition, and the lack of expansion Pursuit of means, let the enemy run away most of the expected results. As long as the task of expelling the morning army is reached, it is a successful blockade. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were more than 1,800 people surrendering, of which 25 were nobles, and the highest was the count, claiming to be the lord of flowers. But what made Itis interested was another baron named Lei Min Peyton. The report said that in a request to pay a ransom, hoping to be properly treated, he repeatedly stressed that he and a senior official of the gray castle are old-fashioned, and have a friend relationship with the king of the gray castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does this person say that?" She shook the booklet toward the eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is estimated that it is just nonsense, or that the king of the Grey Fort is Tiffco. Wimbledon." The deputy battalion frowned. "What are you going to do?" To surrender the nobility?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Redemption is impossible, first throw it into the prison and raise it," Itis indulged for a moment, "may later be still It is useful. As for the non-nobles, they can be demobilized on the spot. We don’t have the extra food for them.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
