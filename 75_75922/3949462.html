			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the palace hall of the Yongdong Wangdu, the fire of the fireplace has burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer is particularly short compared to the four seasons of the Grey Fort, and the autumn is more like a cold warning, or even a light short coat. The cold wind will come again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiasia. Wimbledon wore a fox coat and sat on the throne, listening to the complaints and demands of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t like this palace, the pillars, the walls and the floor are all made of white stone, each piece is polished and smooth, looks like a strong Ice is average. Although she added two layers of velvet cushions to her seat, she could still feel the bitter chill from the cold iron chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This damn house is like an ice barrier, she is unhappy. When the situation is stable, the first thing to do is to smash all the ground walls and re-lay them with dark brown granite slabs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected, I hope you can get justice for me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nobleman Crying and sorrowful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this guy, Rory said a lot, in fact, a few words can be clearly stated. It was nothing more than a public trial of some evil aristocrats after the church occupied the king. The host was Bishop Heather. Most of them were on the gallows, and the guy was lucky. He was only convicted of confiscation of property and divided equally among the victims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can understand that your private property cannot be plundered," Garcia pondered for a moment and slowly said, "But the number is hard to define. So. If you can provide a financial statement for the past five years, I can withdraw a portion of the compensation from the seizure to you on average."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the mobs will My house was looted, and these records are afraid..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I can only compensate according to the published notice, with the title of the title." Interrupted, "Look at you, they are all aristocrats who have been ransacked. If you give more to others, others will get one less. What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, who knows if the number of your newspapers is true!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you still, Sir Halon, those Golden Dragons It doesn't belong to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s good to have your share, look at your accomplices, they can only go to heaven. God wants to compensate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the surrounding aristocrats glaring at themselves, he had to be timid and bowed, "So it will be issued according to your standards." Thank you for your kindness and your majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good," Garcia smiled slightly, "Next."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ask you, sire," a white-haired old man walked out of the crowd and kissed his chest respectfully. The silver heron's emblem on his chest sparkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marquis de Bod, I remember that your territory was not attacked by church thugs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes," he nodded. "Not that they didn't want to, but they couldn't... The snowy mountains were easy to defend, and my knight blocked the invasion of the mob. But my children were not so lucky, riots. On the same day, he was on duty at the palace. In order to protect the former queen, he was not only killed by the believers, but also the body was hung on the gate. Until you arrived in the winter, he was freed from shame."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a tragic story,” Garcia put on her sad expression and sighed. “So what do you need me to do?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The person who killed him is called the butcher. Now he has become the leader of the remnant insurgents. This group of people are hiding in the mountains of the north, I want to avenge my children. The Marquis stated calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The strength of my team is not many. In addition to patrolling, guarding the city walls and granaries on weekdays, it is difficult to find people to go to the wild mountains and find such a hundred. Come to an exiled thug." She shook her head and expressed regret. "And once in the winter, the snow is closed, they can't get supplies, and sooner or later they will freeze in the inside, why are you eager for a moment."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
