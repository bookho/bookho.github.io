			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...the city of the devil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but marvel at it. He thought that the memory fragments would be connected to a certain battlefield. I didn’t expect to have the chance to face the enemy’s nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many differences between the sights and the mirages that the Association has seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least he looked around and did not find the most prominent core main tower - that is, the Takira witch’s mouth uses the stone of the god stone as a raw material to grow on its own And make a giant obelisk of red fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, there are too many towers here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some are still standing on the cliff, the large half of the tower cantilevered out, like a castle in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do they come up with such a magnificent architectural complex? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the city is not the leaf they see, then where is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, is it located farther away... like the rumored continent where the devil was born? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Roland noticed that the area below the ring of red fog near the pit was seemingly flashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is different from the crystal clear matte surface, which seems to be a burning flame in its natural state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him feel a little surprised. Since the red fog can burn, the devil's city should be banned from open fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In curiosity, he decided to go down to the bottom of the pit to see it - according to the architectural style of the hole in the cliff, the neighborhood should be able to find the downward Stairs or hanging baskets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before he even walked out of the 100 meters, Roland suddenly stopped his foot and tightened his muscles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a team of devils at the corner of the front! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the appearance, they should all be mad, with armor on their bodies, holding a spear in their hands, and the two leaders are wearing gloves and burly The figure almost blocked his halfway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance between the two is less than ten steps away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc. How can there be living things in memory fragments? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not see a trial army or church priest while he was hanging out in his own Hermes Cathedral! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This accident made Roland unable to prevent it, and he did not know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen the power and precision of the mad magic spear, and giving the back to the enemy is undoubtedly a self-seeking way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crash up and dry them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the dream world is still running in his body. At this moment, his skill is far superior to ordinary people, but compared with these monsters of killing, his fighting skills are basically Stay at the level of the fighting, one-on-one may be able to do, one person fighting with six madmen? He feels that the chances of winning are very small, especially the leading iron hand devil, whose powerful electric shock ability is definitely the nemesis of the melee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, before he made a decision, the surprise happened again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil does not seem to notice the existence of the uninvited guest, but walks by himself from the ground, without even stopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland groaned, then subconsciously turned back and reached for the last madman's arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finger passed through its epidermis, but the fingertips did not convey any touch, as if touching the phantom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He retracted his hand thoughtfully and leaned over to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the palm clearly felt a damp from the black soil eroded by the red mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has a vague answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the resistance of the devourer will not only determine the extent of the memory fragment, but also the things displayed in the scene - what is stored in this memory Obviously, it will be much more than the one left by Jieluo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about this idea, he couldn’t help but have two new doubts in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is a church warrior who deliberately feeds on the cleansing, and how much their memory can be enriched. Can you still talk to the deceased after entering? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is Jielu’s sense of resistance – or how hateful and unwilling to be after defeating him? Actually compared the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he suddenly had the urge to go back and hang up the little guy at home to make a butt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland takes a deep breath and throws away the distracting thoughts in his heart, speeding up his steps to the destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he thought, there are many entrances to the edge of the ring cliff The bottom of the ramp and the stone ladder, and some of them are also very spacious, and do not lose the main road of the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more he goes down, the deeper he feels about the breadth of the Red Mist Lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the upper half of the West Snow Mountain is flattened, I am afraid it is just that. Standing on the half slope, he couldn't help but feel a sense of smallness, and the heavens and the earth seemed to be far away from him, leaving only the tumultuous fog pillars and the overhanging stone towers looming in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to imagine that this crater is naturally formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even more incredible is that the devil has transformed this place into his own home. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, it will take hundreds of years to build a ring-shaped passageway for carriages and a hard black stone? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use this to measure the technical level and social organization of the devil, it is a very tricky enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human beings today do not have the chance to win, and to win the battle of God, the four kingdoms must go all out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a little closer to the fire, Roland noticed that the devil on the road became more dense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t all carry weapons, they wear mostly animal skins or robes, and their appearance and body shape are more diverse. It’s hard to imagine these. Guys are the same species. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information in Pasha also mentioned that the federation has captured some devils with no magic and fighting power, but the fashion is not sure if they are A kind of devil, or a vassal race enslaved by the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Roland did not find the presence of superior devils similar to the supervisors, their actions appear to be completely spontaneous, which means that the answer should The former is correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This separation seems to be more thorough than the division of the witch, not only the ability, but also the form of complete differentiation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still unclear, are they born with the same origin, or are they all different, and there is never a possibility of change? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil is also divided into male and female? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, their reproduction is completely different from human beings and cannot be generalized? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this guess, Roland finally arrived at the bottom of the ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
