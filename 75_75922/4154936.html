			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is smooth, the surface line is a smooth curve in any direction, and the bright and bright paint can even reflect the figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cab is like a raised bubble, wrapped entirely in innocent glass, obviously taking into account the effects of airflow at high speeds. The cockpit position is quite backward, the tail of the bubble is slightly higher than the front end, and smoothly integrated into the body. The benefits of this layout can be seen at a glance. The low front and high energy can significantly improve the driver's vision. The curve of the glass cover is combined with the tail rudder, which makes the body look very clean and neat, and the various parts are integrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest difference between the new aircraft and the fact that any student will not ignore is that there is no propeller at the nose! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the flat engine, the entire head eventually converges into a sharp cone, which is full of clouds and waves. Most parts of the body are painted in vivid orange-red, which makes it look like a slender flame. Several white lines as an embellishment run from the beginning to the end, which makes the body full of vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even a layman who knows nothing about flying can feel the elegance and beauty of its outline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the first sight of the new plane, Tilly found that she had fallen in love with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But...how can the plane fly without a propeller? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only Tilly, this is also the idea of ​​most people on the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the other two boxes were opened, the question was answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second iron box is encased in a wing and a tail. In terms of quantity, it has only one pair of wings, and instead of the skyfire, there is a pair of main wings. There are two symmetrical interfaces below the airfoil, apparently for other large parts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two engines in the last container. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if it is just an engine, the volume is too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the Skyfire, it is more like an integrated whole that can be replaced at any time. Careful Tilly has noticed that its surface has been painted. The red color is consistent with the body, and there are many inspection ports on the top, and the black hole weapons are installed in the hole below the slurry shaft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Associated with the reserved interface on the wing, her mind has gradually emerged as a general appearance of the new aircraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fuselage no longer bears the power system, the slender single wing is located under the fuselage, the resistance is further reduced; the two engines are distributed on both sides of the wing, giving the aircraft double Double the thrust...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can’t wait to climb it and experience it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," Morrier groaned in his pocket and found a letter. "This is the next time you ship with the goods." The envelope indicates that it must be opened by you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly takes out the stationery and spreads it in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the gift I promised, I hope it can "You are satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The detailed description and specific parameters are in the instruction manual in the cockpit, but I think you are not in the right place." I will read it carefully, but I can't wait to go straight to the subject."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it can fly now, then even this letter will probably put Look after the flight - this is why I sent it to the morning light. At least when the workers are assembling, you can have time to read the instruction manual first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "After all, it has a very different structure and characteristics from the Skyfire. Even if you are an extraordinary person, there is no harm in understanding it before taking off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"What is your Majesty? I want to see it too..." Morel leaned over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hurriedly leaned over and blocked the other’s line of sight. “Cough, it’s actually nonsense, don’t look at it.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"诶""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to drink chaotic drinks?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Think!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to my office and take it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tili fingers One point, Moryl immediately rushed away in the direction she pointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She whispered and turned her eyes back to the letterhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, it is about the name of the aircraft."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wanted to use The title of the unicorn, but always felt that it was a little worse than the red electric light that made the sky, so I simply changed a new name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that It is a noun that Tilly has never seen before - no doubt, it was created by Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried to read it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Phoenix..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In our case, the phoenix is ​​a god bird, always It is related to the fire, and it matches the red color. Of course, the most important thing is that the phoenix is ​​not dead. Every four thousand six hundred days will be the golden plaque, and after 4,600 days, it will be broken and reborn." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what I want to say - no matter what kind of enemy I face, I hope that you can come back alive."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the phoenix."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will bring you back to the ashes, so you must keep your promise."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have agreed, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know why, Tilly suddenly felt that her eyes were sour Bulging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rubbed her eyes hard, resisted the surging warmth, and took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The phoenix is ​​not dead..." She whispered with a voice that only she could hear. "Good name. I accepted this gift, my brother. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...His Royal Highness?" the guard asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing," Tilly lifted her hand. "Notify the ground, let them install the Phoenix with the fastest speed. I can't wait to test." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, the assembled new aircraft sailed out of the hangar. Slowly slide into the runway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Is this the special machine you mentioned? It looks really good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The sound of lightning came from the hearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly looked up - through the glass hatch, she could clearly see the expedition duo hovering in the sky. As the first flight of the Phoenix, she deliberately called lightning and wheat to prevent accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that the interior design of this aircraft is better than the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she was in the cockpit, she even developed the illusion that it was not a pure war machine, such as a thicker and softer seat, when driving for a long time It doesn't feel back pain; all kinds of levers and buttons have manipulation feedback, which makes them more convenient to use; and the slot reserved for listening to the prints, even when fighting, can be easily and multiple Holder dialogue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is more like a plane designed for her than the Unicorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
