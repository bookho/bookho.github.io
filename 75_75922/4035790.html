			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of five lives has made Roland realize that the biggest gap between the two lies in the individual, the powerful weapon is easy to spread to himself, and fixed The fortress will become the target of the divine seal. What's more, the other party has a ** know the formula of snow powder, if it is desperate to paste it with him, or directly collapse the roof, he also consumes so many lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can't limit the freedom of the pure, this battle will be defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cage? Directional mines? Grid? Laser fence? The answer is constantly emerging in his heart, and another veto, it is impossible to forbid the Jielu forever. The position after death can be in situ, or it may be in any corner of the rooftop, and his energy has obviously reached the bottom. Constantly creating consumables is tantamount to wasting the few resurrections. Once it fails, maybe the next time is real. death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deprive her of her mobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect the integrity of the rooftop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still want to kill her hundreds of times...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...maybe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland took a deep breath. "How many times have you experienced such a battle in two hundred years?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thousands of times, or more, but there are only a handful of impressions." Jieluo replied, "Their will be stronger than you, but they will eventually lose." Endless death. Few people choose to continue to suffer from a hopeless ending," she paused for a moment. "Are you still going to stick to the previous practice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My hopes are really small, just want to satisfy curiosity before the end of everything, you have never failed after more than a thousand battles?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it fails, I won't stand here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why," Roland sat down slowly, saving himself only A little physical strength, "No one has ever imagined a lava or deep sea. Before you have gained such a great mental power, rely on a more determined spirit to overcome you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a fresh idea, but no one can do this," Jie Luo walked up to him. "Light is changing what we stand." The place, the mental energy is as much as death, and the delusion to change the whole world? Only the gods can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My world has no gods," he Regrettably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you decided to give up?" The pure man provoked his chin, "then surrender to me, return to me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry," Roland smiled, holding both hands on his shoulders, and then pushing it gently. "I want to try again."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo got up and pulled out the weapon, only to find that the distance between the two is constantly pulling away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She changed her look and wanted to rush straight over, but soon noticed that she couldn’t move any more distance anyway - even Running at full speed, the body still slides backwards! Jieluo lowered his head, and the roof of the foot did not know when it had become as smooth as a mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, contrary to her common sense, even if the ground is so smooth, she will not slip. No matter what action it does, the body remains still, as if it were crucified on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that your amazing action seems to be no longer good," Roland said. "The loss of friction support, even if it is like you." Such a monster can no longer go any further."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you do?" Jielu leaned down and used both hands and feet to slow down or change direction. Can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Made a small change to the battlefield." He changed his seat in a more comfortable position. "It seems that as long as the change is not large, change the environment." The mental energy needed to consume is not too outrageous. Right, have you heard of the law of inertia?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When an object is not subjected to external forces, it will remain stationary or move at a constant linear motion. Of course, you can also call it Newton's first law." During the conversation, Roland hit the railing of the roof and stopped, then under the foot. The ground has changed dramatically! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel frame grows out of the ground and continues to extend into the sky, and then the sheet metal cover is pressed up to wrap these dark frames - Soon a monument with a cold and cold light appeared behind Roland. Each layer of the monument is evenly divided into ten rectangular units, which looks like an elongated cube. A rectangular hollow steel tube protrudes from the center of each rectangular unit, pointing straight to the clean radish that is still sliding at a constant speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now it’s my turn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo has realized that it’s not good, She held a long knife and the golden light flashed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, Roland is faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly one hundred steel pipes simultaneously roared, the gunpowder burned the air to a temperature of more than a thousand degrees, and the high pressure generated by the rapidly expanding air pushed the shells in the steel pipe out of the pipeline. At the speed of 1900 meters per second, it rushed to the pure. The huge roar is deafening, and the top of the building is like a bright tomorrow. The campus that has just fallen into the night is shining like a white! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100 million turrets, trillions of stars! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night sky is lit up by the light, that is, the fireflies are flying in the wings - the dense spots are dragging out the dazzling trajectory in the night, and the cross is pouring over the instructions of the forerunner On the position. Fireflies struggled to fan their wings and make a sharp whistling sound, as if they were telling the world about their arrival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they came to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that moment, the light of the firefly magnified tens of thousands of times, their bodies turned into hot fragments, scattered and scattered... with this dazzling light It’s the tearing of the torn world, echoing the whistling of the sky, and it’s a piece of it – it’s just that Roland can’t hear the sonata that is intertwined with metal and gunpowder, the first in the black square. In the flame, his eardrums have been shattered by the high-pitched sound waves - the big gun barrels roared under him, and the hot air made him feel pain in his cheeks, but he was very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing on the square monument, the world has become completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire rooftop is like being divided into equal chessboards, each of which has artillery pouring into it. He sees the pure person being picked up by the explosive airstream, like a storm. Falling leaves up and down - no life can survive under the cover of artillery. When she is new, the firefly of death will follow and reinvent her. She couldn't escape. On the ground without friction, even if she couldn't change her direction of action, she could only watch the countless light spots dragging the long flame tail and screaming in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo shouted incredulously, "You can't Create something that doesn't exist out of thin air, this kind of thing... can't exist!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being baptized with countless guns, the ground is still as clean as new, seeing There is no trace of scratches, as if the sky-filled firefly has nothing to do with it. It is smoother than the mirror, harder than steel, and this kind of thing can't exist! The pure person hysterically shouts.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if she can't hear her voice, Roland can guess her feelings - he really can't turn himself into a superman, but he can create something that is no less than Superman. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He changed the spacing of atoms on the surface of the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atoms rely on strong interactions Like a lined soldier, lined up neatly. This surface is almost absolutely smooth and has incredible strength, tetrahedral gold The stone is soft like water in front of it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action of Jieluo is completely imprisoned, she can’t run, she can’t escape, she can only fluctuate with the gunfire. It has nothing to do with the will, but the disparity between the cognitions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to start the divine signature several times, but the constant connection of the gunfire will not give her any respite Opportunity, gradually, Jielu can no longer maintain his appearance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
