			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn Kingdom, the foot of the cage, the town of thorns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of carriages slowly passed through the streets and stopped in front of the Lord’s Mansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you get to the place, you will roll down the old man, and your hands and feet will be sharp!" The person dressed in a suit waved the whip in his hand and sipped it one by one. If you want to live, you will know each other. When the adults ask, what do you answer, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who came down from the car were mostly ragged, His face was pale and his hands were tied together by a hemp rope, like a bunch of grasshoppers. There is no doubt that they are slaves and the lowest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of scene has recently become the norm in the town of thorns - the town that nobody cares about has been busy since the Gray Fort exploration team was stationed, not only The caravans are endless, and there are many messengers sent by the local lords. They either stayed in the house or set up tents and barracks outside the town. In just over a month, the remote town looked like a big circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Malay, how are you looking at these people?" Flint Sheffield from Fengge City is one of them, he looks at it. The representative of the great aristocrats of Huiguang City, Mark Tokat, asked with a smile. "The body is healthy and has no defects. It is the best product selected from the prison. They don't look like they are thin, they are actually fierce." As long as you feed two meals, you can definitely meet your requirements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," Marl impatiently waved his hand, although the other side hangs The name of the lord of Fengge, but when I look at the way I know that it is not a person who needs to care, it is not worthy of talking. "It is not me who wants to buy a prisoner, but the one who is next to me, the former guardian of the king of the Grey Fort, Mr. Shawn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "It turned out to be the case," Fulin re-elected. "The Lord of the Lord just immediately heard the call of the Lord of the Morning, and immediately decided to respond. He told me to prepare for the departure as soon as possible. In this case, I have to wait for this omission. Please forgive me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Sean walked up to the group and swept away. Compared with the first batch of prisoners sent by the Lord of the Morning, the quality is obviously much worse. However, the curse temple has now been transferred to the full-scale excavation stage. It is in need of a large number of people. He does not intend to make more care on this issue. As long as it can be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he walked to the center of the team, suddenly a prisoner slammed at him. "Adult, I am embarrassed, please let me go." !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the hands are tied to a long rope, the other party’s action to grab the ground is just half done, and it is only pulled by the wall. Straight to the ground and pleaded on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are looking for death!" The manager suddenly felt a squeaky expression. If there were not two other adults, I was afraid that I would have already pulled the whip. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is it?" Sean stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't kill and rob, just slaughtered a neighbor's nest of chickens!" the prisoner replied quickly. "This will only be seen in Fengge City." Sentence or exile, sin is not dead, adults!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that true?" Sean looked at Flint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter quickly said, "It’s not yet, sir. Just the day before the call of the Lord of the Morning, the Earl of Sheffield happened to have the law of the Territory. A small adjustment - in order to combat the increasingly rampant mouse and underground crime, all punishments have risen by one level, and theft is no exception."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? "The prisoner stunned. "Should kill a few chickens and sentence him to death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this difficult to understand?" Forlin scorned He glanced at him. "The war has just erupted in the kingdom. In order to eliminate the insurgents, Fengge City is also badly hurt. In addition, if the number of people is soaring and not severely sentenced, how can you suppress these dross? Today you stole it. Neighbors' chickens, maybe someday the neighbors will starve to death, which is different from killing! In my opinion, it is just a matter of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Adult, I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
