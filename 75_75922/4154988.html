			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people crossed the cage mountain and turned to the west, all the way to the desolate mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, Mai Hao was defeated first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the airspace of 1,500 meters, the Phoenix easily flew out of the speed of 400 kilometers with two engines. Although the shape of the sea bream can reach this speed, it can only last for a little while, and it is a matter of time before the tireless new four-cylinder engine is opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Tilly covered her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I, I can fly...Hey!" There was a panting in the wheat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have tried your best, let me come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning The team who refused to accept the loss was taken into the arms and took over the second phase of the test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person and one machine launched a new chase in the gray sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenery under the feet is getting smaller and smaller, and the mountains separating the human kingdom are gradually becoming a sinister ink line. Tilly can see the distance from the mainland spine. The red mist flowing under the shackles is above the wolf heart and the wolf heart, like a turbid barrier. The land in the barrier is undoubtedly filled with scarlet, but as long as it can rush to the sky, you can see the true appearance of the world again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this your limit?" The sound of lightning sounded. "I can fly far faster than this!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of flight speed, the ability of the other party is really unparalleled, even if it is the owner of the Scorpio who has the power to transmit, she has suffered in her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for Tilly, winning is not the most important thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pleasure to drive this huge but flexible machine to its limits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took back the sight of the overlook, smiled slightly, pulled up the nose and flew towards the higher airspace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning also followed, and remained at a position about a hundred meters in front of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the introduction in the instruction manual, Phoenix has been technically optimized in the world of dreams, and the key parts are also processed by Anna himself. The basic quality of Skyfire is that the speed of Pingfei can reach 550 kilometers per hour and the maximum range is more than 1,500 kilometers. The star engine with double rows is also equipped with a turbine system, making it at 3,000 meters. The above airspace flight performance will not be greatly attenuated, which is what the production model can't do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not the biggest feature of the Phoenix. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its body structure has been strengthened by candlelight and Doris. The strength and durability can be said to be on the material itself. It can be regarded as the first industry. An aircraft that combines technology and magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tily knows that the propeller is most efficient at low speeds, and as the speed increases, its propulsive efficiency will decrease rapidly, so it is only based on its own power. It is almost impossible to touch the back of lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She must use the help of other forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After pulling up to the sky away from the clouds, Tilly slammed the throttle to the maximum and forced the lever down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The engine suddenly screams! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Phoenix turned sharply and entered the dive state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to keep myself in the forefront, lightning also quickly fell in the direction of adjustment, just to avoid mutual influence, she pulled the horizontal distance to about one kilometer, vertical direction There is still a constant 100-meter gap - at this height and speed, the "light film" of the magical tone is very obvious, and the sparkling ripples form a protective layer around her to prevent her from being affected by the cold wind and low pressure. influences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when testing the ability, Roland mentioned that the reason why lightning can't be in supersonic flight for a long time is probably that the flight itself needs too much magic, but the magic coherence is greatly increased due to the consumption of the body in a very short environment. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she rarely enters the speed of sound when patrolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For witches, it’s dangerous to arbitrarily consume empty magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Tilly is not very good at the moment, the thin air in the air makes her breath very hard, the full speed of the engine and the gust of wind blowing the cockpit The noise and tremors rose sharply, and there was no magical co-tune protection. She could only rely on her body to support it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the airspeed indicator, the Phoenix has approached the speed of 800 kilometers per hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This greatly exceeds its extremely high limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the lightning is still stable in front of the nose, there is no time to talk to her with a hearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it’s gravity that Tilly wants to borrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When driving the biplane, she found that when the accumulated height was converted into speed, it was easy to break through the limits of the aircraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the risk of this kind of speed can not be ignored, but it can not be pulled back, but directly disintegrated in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for her ability to perceive that tipping point, she would never use the dive to speed up during the test flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even so, the chances of catching up with lightning are minimal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembers that Roland said that due to the principle of the blade, the piston plane wants to exceed the speed of sound and it costs a lot of money. In other words, it is worth the loss, so much so that it The propeller was replaced shortly after the engine came out. Lightning can break through the sound barrier at any time, and the gap between the two is not at one level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she needs help from other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rapid decline in height, the dense dark clouds in the 2,500-meter airspace hit the two like the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phoenix whistling into the dark clouds, splashing a "fog column" on the clouds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the speed of the plane has exceeded 900 kilometers, the tremor began to spread from the body to the wings, she can feel the airfoil just as the blade is cut open in front of the thick Airflow, this high-speed friction makes the air no longer a vain thing, but like a thick wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning disappears into view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly knows that the opportunity is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She focused her attention on the handling of the aircraft - the thrust provided by the propeller was almost equal to the resistance at this speed, and the average person should consider how to pull back again. Instead of letting it dive faster, the plane. Only Tilly can maintain precise control under such severe tremors and use the rudder adjustment to further increase the speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the acceleration is not large, it is enough to narrow the distance from the front runners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Phoenix itself approaches its limits, she rushes out of the clouds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast expanse of the earth re-emerges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time there is lightning - compared to the previous stable 100 meters lead, she is now at the same level as the new aircraft. The latter, who was conscious of the moment, entered the speed of sound, but quickly slowed down and turned closer to the cockpit of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not the Royal Princess," there wasn’t much frustration in the look of lightning, but more than a sigh. "The cloud can be taken into account." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's thinner, I won't be able to catch you." Tilly laughed and flattened as she flattened her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
