			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the town hall, the cityman claiming to be a spine was brought to the two witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is about forty years old. His face is a typical farmer's image. His skin is dark, his hands and feet are thick, and his feet are covered with dry mud and grass roots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I know you..." The other person looked nervous, licking his wrinkled hands and bowing his head to the book. "You are a minister." My daughter is confessing in your college. She is stupid. Please don't give up on her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be nervous," the book smiled I patted him on the shoulder. "I used to be half a farmer before I came here - but my field is an unpredictable sea, and the harvest is not as stable as you. As for knowledge, it doesn't care. The identity of the learner, as long as the time is long enough, the clumsy person can also master, so your daughter will be able to graduate successfully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words relaxed a lot, and eloquently said, "I also switched from farming to grazing in the last two years, because my salary is higher when I say that the new industry." He also gave Wendy a gift. "You must be the manager of the Witch Alliance. I thought I couldn't see you today."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it does not have a wide influence in the hearts of ordinary people like a book, as the person in charge of his designation, Wendy often appears frequently at various major ceremonies. Adding that bright red hair and unforgettable body, it is not surprising to be recognized. "Call me Wendy. You said that you found a woman who was injured in the suburbs. Why do you think she looks? Like a witch?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Because... ordinary people can’t grow a part of an animal?” Spinsek scratched his head, “I am At the beginning, I thought it was a piece of bloody rag. I was about to tear it down and throw it away, but I didn't expect it to be connected with the girl! I looked at it and found out that it was actually an animal tail!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animal...Tail? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wendy’s heart banged! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly remembered that as early as more than two months ago, there was indeed a strange witch who had come to No Winter City. Since she neither joined the Witch Alliance nor had deep contact with her sisters, her understanding of her all came from the chanting of the nightingale. One of them was repeatedly recited, that is, she has a non-human appearance, wolf-like ears and long tails, which are obviously weird, but they are praised and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the witch is called Luo Jia, which is a tribal princess from the extreme south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it that she finds in the spine! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is she?" Wendy eagerly asked, "Come and take us to see her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer did not take the injured home, but placed it in the temporary shelter of the pastoral area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When seeing a wolf woman lying motionless on the bench and her body clothing had been stained with blood stains, Wendy’s heart sank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judging from the incomplete ears of the other party, she should be Luojia’s right, but... what happened, let her become the present Look like? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not an exaggeration to use blood on her body – it can be seen that she was not a day or two of injuries, some blood has dried up and turned into Dark brown, while some are still moist, apparently still slowly leaching. From head to toe, bandages are tightly tied everywhere. Although it is impossible to directly observe the wound, anyone who sees this scene will understand that she has multiple injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, this is a witch... Right?" asked Spink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty was a little worried at the moment, did not answer, answering his book is, "Yes, she is a witch, you are doing very well."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, your Majesty was not announced in the announcement, and found that the witch should report to the City Hall immediately." Bossack breathed a sigh of relief, but soon worried "This girl can... can it be saved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, give it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa and Lily are not in the city now, the leaves of the herbs are under the slightest injury, like Luojia It is no different from the death penalty in the case of serious injury, but it is a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately fortunately, the first migrants on the island of sleep also arrived in the winter city - if it was that person, there might be ways to save it. Her life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I think of it, Wendy runs faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She must hurry up for the rest of the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the other party is not a member of the Witch Alliance, since it has arrived in the Winter City, it is the guide of the gods. Under this guidance, Luo Jia has already made some connection with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't want to lose any more sisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, Wendy took a pot of hot water into the bedroom, full of The smell of the drug suddenly came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is she?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can only be said to be alive," Ashes shook his head. "The injury she has suffered has far exceeded the limit of self-healing. It is a blessing to insist on returning to the winter city without a winter. I will die in the wilderness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the most experienced and extraordinary person in the emergency response, the ash is taken care of after the care, and the whole body examination after peeling off the blood coat is also shocking, all under the bandage The scars of the skin open, and some visible bones, it took a long time to clean these wounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you don't have to worry too much," she pointed to the sundial on another bed. "Did you find that her look is much better than yesterday?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there?" The Japanese are weak and powerful. "How can I not feel better?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the evening, there are steamed chicken, fried egg, salted ostrich and mushroom, and a bottle of chaotic drink," Ash said. "How, how do you feel now?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter swallowed, "Oh... it seems to be better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty sighed and nodded in the Asahi. "You have been working hard for a few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "She barely smiled. "After all, if you helped Effie, it would help us. Just don't let her die - or I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Do not worry, no."<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wendy first thought of the man is the sundial - the witch who was originally a bloody party has an incredible ability to symbiosis with others through magical species. When the seeds are planted, the two living organisms form a wonderful link, not only able to spread the pain, but also produce their own recovery. In addition, half of the supplements obtained in the future will be provided to the symbiosis, which is the most powerful guarantee for saving the dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland had been in a coma for several months after the war of divine, relying on the ability of the sun to allow him to survive without food and water. Life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, more than one person will participate in this rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a command from His Royal Highness, a witch named Pandora who stopped the internal and external bleeding of the wolf woman, greatly reducing the pressure on both sides of the symbiosis, and the former is also The main healers of Sleeping Island have played an important role in the rebellious actions that undermine the blood. The leaves of the herb better protect the wound from further deterioration. In addition, those who are refrigerated with ice cubes in the basement of the castle to prepare for the purification of water from time to time have also played a key role, so that Luo Jia has never been infected by the disease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has done their best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
