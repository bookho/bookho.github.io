			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that Wang is a great treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is very backward as a city, those seemingly magnificent buildings are not worth mentioning in the eyes of Roland, but it is still in the Grey Fortress Kingdom. The most embarrassing pearl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of population, it has a much larger number of nobility than other cities - any aristocrat who lost its land and lost its land, the first thing that comes to mind is that the king is looking for opportunities. . Together with the landless knights and jazzs of the royal family, this proportion has been further improved. For example, in the inner city residents, the proportion of the nobility is close to 20%, and they usually have primary education, can read and write, for Roland It is a preparatory official worthy of training. After all, without land and family business, it will not be too far from the new policy, and good knowledge can also accept new things faster than ordinary civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the industry, Wang Du is also a combination of Dacheng, in addition to commercial and artisan guilds, also has the largest alchemists association, and a unique astrologer association. These talents are all objects of Roland, and summoning Barov and Kemer Spoel are also coming to accommodate them as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is wealth... The collection of all kinds of materials in the palace is enough for ten Dukes of Ryan, and the golden dragon, jewellery and gold and silver crafts are piled up in several warehouses. In addition, with the other heavy ministers who have fallen together with Tiffco, the final statistics will inevitably be an astonishing number. If they copy all their products, no winter city will be well-fed for the next two or three years. However, Roland does not intend to carry them all out. It takes too much time to say that taking over the king also requires a large amount of expenses to maintain stability. It doesn't make sense for money to accumulate in the basement and to spill out of it. It is justified to let it flow through its own value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can, Roland hopes to spend half a year to digest the income, but time is not waiting for people, compared to the king in the middle, can The fall of the West and the extreme south are more important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the departure of the Iron Axe, a pro-Wei Hui reported, "Your Majesty, there is a businessman outside the Royal Palace who claims to be Margaret wants to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s eyes suddenly brightened, “Take her to see me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a businesswoman walks into the hall He smiled and stood up from the throne and stepped forward. "We met again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't expect the location to meet again. The Grey Castle Palace," Margarita took off her skirt and bowed her knees. "You always make me accidental, Your Royal Highland... No, you should call you down now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, anyway, the ceremony has not yet taken place, I am not really a king," Roland waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not in a hurry, it is the wind of the king." Margaret said, "It seems that Wang will be full of business opportunities in the future. For the sake of the old buddy, you have to take care of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, even if you don't come to me, I will go to you." "He may not know that Bianbu Town and Changge Fortress have merged into a big city. The steam engine factory has opened several more production lines, and the output can almost triple. After that, there will be many New products, I guarantee that they are all unique things in the four kingdoms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have fully seen your creativity, we can slowly "In detail," Margaret nodded. "But today I am not here for this, and there are other things to ask for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Roland Rao I am interested, "Let's talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you talk about another place?" She looked around and looked low.  ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the financial resources of the Chamber of Commerce can not be resolved, but also to avoid people and ears, is the other party really encountered some difficult trouble? The prince thought for a while, "Go to my study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The study on the top floor of the Crown Tower was originally owned by Wimbledon III, and was the most desirable place for the Four Princes to be children - only here, he could see his dumb father. Roland chose this place, because the terrain is high enough, it is not easy to set the dark road, and only a ring stone step leads to the top of the tower, easy to defend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
