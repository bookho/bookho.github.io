			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the literary records, the most important part of the large-scale manufacture of nitrification* glycerol is temperature control, and a large amount of exotherm during the reaction is very likely to cause sensitive explosives to explode. . Nitrification* glycerol can be safely prepared in batches as long as the temperature of the large reaction vessel is kept constant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the laboratory, you can use ice cubes to cool down, and to use large-scale production and use ice cubes, you can’t do anything about it. The ice-water mixture has a limited heat absorption effect. When a large amount of heat is released, the temperature is slow, the consumption is fast, and the production is very troublesome. And Ai Gesha's hail can easily produce a low temperature near Baidu, which is undoubtedly the best guarantee for cooling the container. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland doesn’t know if the news is unreliable, but it doesn’t prevent him from trying. Even in the event of an accident, Nana Va is the last insurance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he returned to the office, he wrote a letter of introduction to the guard, who took Aegusa to the chemistry lab and sent the letter to In the hands of Camo Spoel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the letter, in addition to introducing Aegis’s ability, he also made up a nobleman’s identity who was in the middle of his family’s family, but he was inadvertently left to the alchemist. Convergence of temper, treat this witch who can greatly help the chemistry experiment. After the guards left and left, Roland still had some peace of mind. Kaimo was a straight temper, and Ai Gesha was an ancient witch who was very self-satisfied. I hope they should not be too noisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he wondered if he would go to the lab in person, the book rolled open and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, the results of the second batch of education universal appraisal came out," she said with a smile on her eyes. "This time there were a total of 762 qualified students." Half of them are adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So much?" Roland was happy. Compared with the first batch of more than 50 children from Carl College, the graduation of half of the adults means that the evening school training has produced results, and at the same time verified the Ministry of Education's series of plans for different schedules and different learning time. The feasibility of the lecture program. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s almost half a year since you started universal education, and the students are generally under 25 years old. Mastering basic reading and writing is not a good one. It’s too difficult.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s probably related to the text itself. It’s definitely not so fast when it is replaced by Chinese. Roland thinks that although he always feels like this. How awkward the words are awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he started to implement universal education, he could not do anything in his heart. After all, this kind of thing was still in the first place in Grey Castle. There is no precedent. Follow. In accordance with the principle of encouragement and subsidy, he has been discussing with the book for a long time, and has developed an educational program that sets up a minor class during the day and a worker class at night, supplemented by a series of encouragement policies that induce workers to come to study. Actually not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, all of this is inseparable from the specific implementers, the responsible management of the books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have worked hard," Roland nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s my pleasure to be able to work for you, Your Highness." She shook her way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the oldest witch in the Witch Alliance, Roland is hard to compare her with the little girl like Anna and Lightning - the book always gives him the feeling that he is not in a hurry. Slow and clear, when you discuss the problem, you can listen to your own thoughts quietly, and you can directly point out your mistakes. Sometimes, he even gives birth to a younger generation in front of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably... She is born to be a teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland smiled and shook his head, throwing away these thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, a number of new forces have been added, and some long-awaited factories are finally ready for construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please help me call Barov," he said with enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town hall manager quickly arrived at the castle. Since the start of the construction of the city, his workload has increased day by day, and more and more blank areas on his forehead have been added, and even wrinkles have grown several times. However, the face does not see fatigue and distress at all, but the spirit is getting better and better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
