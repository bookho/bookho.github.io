			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing here??" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not a sudden silence, if you just go one step later, I’m afraid it’s not just the other party, even it’s hard to escape! I thought that if the other end of the door was still in Dianchi, or if there was no time to open the second twisted door, Heckzod felt cold and sweaty behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it’s not so good to go anywhere, no matter whether the mask is dead or not, it will be known to the king. Even if it has nothing to do with this matter, it does not mean that you can get out of it. As long as the king asks for memory, it will undoubtedly fall into an extremely passive situation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes it unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before silently refused to help it, it thought that the other party was a calm and rational person, and did not expect to see the attitude of Cerroshhi after seeing Wakiris There has been such a big change - <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this guy is still calm and rational, so he will leave quietly, instead of explaining his intentions first - Because it knows that it will stop! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the second program is launched, things can't be recovered, and the only way to stop it is." There is no change in the tone of silence, as if you don't care at all. I was only one line away from death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who said that only this kind? If you sink your heart and think hard..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hecksod said that half of the sound was suddenly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does there really be a better way? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t let the mask be noticed, let’s not let the king know, let the god of God keep it as it is... This method may exist, but time ? In fact, I don't mention the strategy that requires a lot of effort to lay out. I just don't make up my mind if I don't want to do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy...has it seen? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod's lips squirmed for a moment, and finally only changed a topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cerrocam wants to ask it further, seems to be waiting for it . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this way, we will completely stand on the opposite side of the king, and other monarchs will regard us as enemies. And..." The Lord of Heavenly Slight paused, " Humans will not necessarily let us go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the trade-offs." Cerroshhi said simply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weighing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In my eyes, this question is not so difficult to choose. "It turned and walked outdoors - although at the moment the control room had only half of the wall and a crumbling door." "The future things can be slowly thought out, but Wakiris can't die in this way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the answer..."Do you mean? Is Wakiris more important than the fate of the ethnic group?” Heckzod sinks his breath. “I don’t believe this will be what it means. You are sure that what you have seen is the nightmare tyrant, not "The scam set by man?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it tells me that if it is for the ethnic group, it would be fine to sacrifice it." Cerrochhi calmly replied, "This is my personal judgment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The Lord of Heaven did not know what to pick up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation has become tricky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a dull squeaking roll over the heads of the two men, it seems to come from under the feet, or deeper! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this endless rumble, the god of God made a tremor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is - what happened?" Heckzod looked surprised at the lagoon below the pothole, seeing the lake boiling like a crystal Get up, as if something is coming out. The birth tower in the middle of the lake also shines faintly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of Scorpio soon saw a more incredible sight—the magical core that should have been blasted by the explosion, bursting with dazzling blue light, slowly rising from the lake and flying towards the tower of birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is not unfamiliar, although it is very clever in construction, it is also the only creation of the underground civilization that can change the magic form, but the skeleton itself can be handcuffed. Broken, it is not strong at all. The previous explosion could even fly at the top of the central tower. How could it just push the core into the lake? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cerroshhi also changed his look. It took off the long-handled sword and slammed a few steps, then threw the hilt with maximum strength! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade is turned into a streamer that hits one of the cores accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter is not broken, but it doesn't move. The long-handled sword is like a very sturdy object. It spins and flies, then falls into the tumbling lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come..." Siroshahi muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the core is close to a certain distance from the birth tower, there is a flash of light between the two, as if they are connected to each other. The other cores are the same, until the moment when the four bands of light come together, the four cores begin to slowly rotate around the birth tower, and the tower's light is filled to a pole! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boom ————————"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock has suddenly expanded several times Dust and gravel fall from the top of the head. Many houses built near the potholes even collapse into the lake. The central tower is obviously not so good. The part connected with the pit wall makes a creaking sound. The crack began to spread on the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the violent shaking, Heckzold felt a clear sense of overweight, as if there was something on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God of God is rising! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, this plan should not wait until the king arrives in the fertile plains?" Heikezod bit his teeth. "How can it be done so long in advance?" Ready to prepare?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cerroshhi also noticed the difference, which is exactly like the long-planned behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it..." Heikkod stared at the silence for a moment, then pulled it into the twisted door and returned to the bottom Dianchi. "You take off your armor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Cerrochahi glanced at it with a puzzled look, but did what he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of the Scorpio took out the colorful magic stone and put it in front of him, only to see a faint "hair" in the other's light column, it It is so fine, if it is not deliberately observed, it is difficult to distinguish it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't move!" Heckzod stretched out two fingers and pierced into the silent shoulder - the latter frowned, but did not stop. Soon, it pulled a bunch of flesh and blood from the other side. After leaving the host, the sarcomatous living creature immediately stopped squirming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nasopelle -" Silence squeezed his fist! Undoubtedly, the parasite is just a fake face, it is put into the wound when it is stunned, and it actually has no reaction to this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So it has long known about our conversations, even...you met with Vakiris in the conscious world." Heikezod will The sarcoma in the hand was thrown to the ground, and then one foot was smashed. "As a result, it can be explained in advance by preparing it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cerroshahi strode to the door with a big step in the wound. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "and so on, where are you going?" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "I want to destroy the magic of the core! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's already late!" Heckzod shouted. "You also saw that those cores are resonating with the birth tower, you are alone." What else can you do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core of the instrument that has been adjusted has now become a whole with the tower of birth, let alone throwing a long sword, even if they are two People do their best, and they are afraid that they will not be able to hurt their points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
