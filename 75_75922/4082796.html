			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the first grove came into view, Luo Jia slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is also the first to set foot in the territory of the North - for this rich land, she has heard many people mention: there is a green forest that never fades, the source is not Absolute water flow; the blue grass can spread the entire plain, and when you reach into the ground, you can feel its moisture and softness. There are only fish and crabs in the river. You don't have to worry about the lurking sandworms swallowing the legs of the water takers. In short, they are full of greenery and vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she has no similar feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s probably because the evil moon has not ended yet, there are only solitary branches above the trunk, and there are some wild weeds in the ground. It is not as big as the Oasis occupied by Tiesha City. The only thing that made her feel the change was that the yellow sand of the ground gradually became dark brown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia looked around and found a sheltered place for the wind, narrowed from a giant wolf to a normal appearance, then put on clothes and smelled the air. The residual smell continues to move in the direction of the caravan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days she has been so over, and after the day, she becomes a wolf-like run, as long as the direction is generally north, and the sandworm and armor are her preparations. The food of choice, sometimes even recruited a group of desert wolves to follow. During the day, he followed the Yinchuan Commercial Road, and he was able to add the water bag by the foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there is no "accident" in the journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the three fans of the mad flame, Luo Jia has always been very generous, the bag of gold dragons in the bag naturally attracted the attention of others. Plus the ears raised high above the head are very sensitive, and the merchants' unscrupulous planning will always be known to her in advance. At the beginning, she would let the vicious people pay a painful price. Later, after simply following the caravan, they used the smell to determine the position of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long day, Luo Jia finally heard the sound of the waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harbour town of the North is not covered with a thick wall, and you can see it on a high slope. The tents stand along the river, and the one near the sea is full of people. Many people are busy repairing a square building, which looks so lively. To her surprise, only a small part of the group was Shamin, and most of the rest were from the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the clear water port, she quickly found the camp where the First Army was stationed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reporting the identity to the guard, Luo Jia did not wait long to see the black-haired woman who made her heart beat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not thought about what to say in the first sentence, the other party has already opened his mouth, "I know you will come." Her tone is calm, golden There is no stranger in the eyes, just like the two were just yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia’s ears can’t help but shake, “Why?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Because you I am very similar," Ashes raised his mouth slightly. "There is a goal in my heart that I want to pursue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a fight?" Her eyes lit up. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No...revenge," the extraordinary witch shook her head and turned and said, "Come with me, the echo will be very happy to meet you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenge? When Luo Jia squatted, she realized that the similarity she said only meant that both of them had goals, but their goals were not the same. She keeps up with each other's pace, "Who is it to revenge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hermes Church," Ashes shrugged, "in the beginning just to vent hate, But it took a long time to become a habit. Until I met His Royal Highness, I discovered that there are more important things in the world than killing them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;His Royal Highness... The wolf woman noticed that when the other person mentioned the name, there was a rare softness in the voice. Is this the person who changed the mountain? She knows that people like ash are difficult to be influenced by the outside world once they have set their goals. It is also an extraordinary person who can influence them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
