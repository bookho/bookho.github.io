			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, like the extreme south, it is quite rare for black water to gather into the "underwater river". According to the report of the iron axe, from the throat swamp To the endless cape, the viscosity of the Styx is constantly decreasing, and the concentration of dead fog is getting thinner and thinner. Among them, the Heishui River Valley is the intersection of several rivers, standing at the height of the valley, and even hearing the dull roar of black water hitting under the feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland speculates that the underground river is constantly changing its composition during the flow process - such as the dead fog described in the report, it is likely that the black water itself volatilizes A toxic gas coming out, or the result of reacting with certain substances in the ground. This may explain why, under the evolution of hundreds of years, the Blackwater Valley has not been turned into a huge brazier due to lightning or artificial arson, and there is a rumor that the throat swamp has entered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead fog covering the top of the Styx can not help but block the sand people's footsteps, but also isolate the air, so that the black water can flow southward stably. In the area around the Cape, the underground dark river is unknown. Only a small part will spurt out the surface due to the pressure, and some form a burning pillar of fire, while others turn into a trickle and shallow. At this time, the black water has no suffocating dead fog and is suitable for mining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a strange crude oil, Roland does not know how many kinds of oil it can decompose. It can only be ordered by the chief alchemist to test it. After the results, do the next step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results are quite exciting now from the separation of samples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blackwater can indeed be used to make terrible weapons, but its use is much more than that," Roland answered the question of Kemo while picking up the glass. The cup is carefully scrutinized. "On the point that the calorific value of combustion is high, there is a lot of work to do, you will know later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this straight son The chief alchemist, hanging him with unknown new things, is the best way to drive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the other person’s desire for dissatisfaction, he smiled secretly. “Talk about the experiment. If you really want to use black water, rely on a few songs. Neck and condensing tubes are not enough. Just like double acid production, you have to think of a method that can be produced on a large scale."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of oil separation is very simple, It is almost the most basic chemical knowledge - the petroleum is converted into steam by heating, and then introduced into the fractionation tower, which uses the boiling points of various oils in the mixed liquid to be condensed in order to obtain gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, heavy oil, etc. Finished product. This process is completely physical, so it is easy to do under experimental conditions. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the increasing variety of refining techniques, the efficiency of crude oil utilization has also increased significantly, but the most classical distillation separation method can still work, not to pay attention to In the case of production costs, nature is the preferred strategy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that any process is magnified, and its complexity will multiply. If you want to carry out industrial fractionation, there are bound to be many more places to consider. Point, Camo Spoel should have a deep understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old alchemist touched his beard. "Hey... I have to think about it for a few more days. In addition, I need the help of the Witch Alliance." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning to take the initiative to use the power of the witch to conduct scientific research experiments, this is a good sign, Roland nodded. "If there is any request, send someone to tell me, I will Arranged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," Kemer’s eyes turned. "Besides, I have a small request." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? You said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you use them to create new gadgets, Can you let me see it?" There is curiosity in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, for the sake of confidentiality, this request is out of bounds, just as the engineer responsible for refining uranium ore wants to know the entire Manhattan project. However, Roland agreed to him after a little thought. After all, this can improve his work enthusiasm, and there is no opponent in this era who can compete with the winter without science and technology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you have to work hard," he pointed to the few cups of liquid. "The sooner you produce them, the sooner you know." Answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
