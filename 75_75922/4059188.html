			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finalizing the plan to hunt down the evil beast, the witches returned to the house to take a break, waiting for the dinner to begin, and Roland left Effie alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have one thing I want to tell you first, lest you be unprepared," he said as softly as possible. "I remember you said Yes, before you are taken over by the blood, you have a friend called Annie, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...here," Iphie blinked. It seems that I don't quite understand why he suddenly mentioned this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Among the witches who rushed to the Grey Fort from the morning, except for the survivor of Tajira posing as a maid, the rest came from the wolf heart. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iphie’s eyes are round and round, "Your Majesty, you mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Roland nodded. "One of them is called Annie, and it is also rejected by the blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly stopped, and passed For a moment, he muttered, "Is this true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Iphi’s face is not all joy, and half of it is Worried, I am afraid that in her heart, I still blame myself for not choosing to leave with the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why I didn’t plan to give a surprise to both of them was because of this point of view - he was not sure what feeling Anne felt about Effie. If you hate to go to the bloody witch who is away from her, the reunion will become very embarrassing when it turns into a face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"3009," Roland said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"3009, her room number," he exhaled, " At least for the time being, she is very close to your description. And if you want to know the answer, don't you know if you look at it yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iphi Silence for a moment, then bowed down to him deeply, "I understand, Your Majesty, thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, time can sometimes dilute everything. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her rushing out of the back of the living room, Roland touched I touched my chin. I can only help you here, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Three-storey and nine-ninth room, three-story and nine-ninth room... Efee mourned the room number while running towards the Witch Building, and even the voices of Yu Yu and Sundial were ignored. Passing through the snow-covered back garden and the white olive grove, she walked up the stairs and quickly reached the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the closer she is to her destination, the slower her footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uneasiness in the heart is constantly expanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same year, Anne took her care to Dagong Island all the way, but when she learned that Anne could not join the bloody meeting, she did not insist on staying. This kind of guilt has always afflicted her, especially after Anne died in the wolf heart, she had been sleeping all night long. In the end, she will vent her hatred to those nobles, disguised as strong and fearless, all cover the shell of remorse in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, this shell can no longer protect her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She instinctively produced fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should she do if Anne does not forgive her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yi Fei stood at the door of the room, but did not dare to reach out and knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I knew you would be like this," a voice rang from the side and scared her. When I looked down, I found that the short, low-spirited Yu Yu didn’t know when she came to her side, and there was still a breathless sundial in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Once you have something related to Annie, you will always be like a person.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You...have heard it?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, your Majesty left you alone, how can we not eavesdrop..." The little girl grinned. "In case he wants to coerce you, we can help." Isn't the door?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you help me like this," Iphie was a little bit crying, and the nervousness in her heart was diluted a bit. "You Actually, let me see my joke!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost like it," Yu Yu shrugged. "Are you ready?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare...what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom!砰 还未 还未 还未 还未 —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, wait..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it’s too late, the footsteps sounded behind the door, and in an instant, Ifeel felt himself All of them are stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the slamming, the door was pushed open, and a tall witch appeared in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just Anne who opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will never forget this face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a sharp-eyed, sharp-eyed eyebrow, and the softness of a caring companion hidden under a strong face. She thought that she would never see each other again, and she was afraid that she would forget the other person's appearance sooner or later. When she reunited again, she discovered that her figure was only temporarily covered up by the dust. When she turned it out again, she still looked like a new one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time seems to be stuck at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Annie, I am tired..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, let's go alone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can't Anne stay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I... want to be with Anne." Together..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fragments in my mind are constantly emerging, the outer shell is falling apart, and she seems to have returned to the past, once again becoming the helpless and awkward girl. Obviously, I wanted to ask a good one, but I couldn’t make a sound. I opened my mouth and my eyes were inexplicably sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie didn’t stop the acidity after all. She hugged Annie, first sobbing softly, then burst into tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry...oh...anne...sorry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beast never cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from this moment on, she is no longer a beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Anne is still a bit sullen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she opened the door, she still didn’t remember who the witch was standing outside, she only felt very familiar, until she hugged herself When I cried and apologized, the experience of the wading of the mountain to the bloody meeting was reappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s impossible to say that there is no resentment in your heart. Even when the bloody teeth try to sell her to the nobility, this kind of betrayal’s anger is also partially moved. I went to Effie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, seeing her crying out of her own appearance, Anne suddenly felt that all the dissatisfaction had vanished - at that time she was as thin as a monkey, face It’s all mud, it’s always a timid thing, and it’s impossible to let her resist the bloody command and desperately stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
