			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, she has always been such a straightforward, not malicious in itself," Wendy quickly apologized. "You don't have to put her words in your heart. If you leave sleep If you curse, you will live a lot harder than it is now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the witches did not answer, especially Ajima, the face was particularly ugly, chest The sharp fluctuations can be seen that her mind is in a state of strong volatility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just ordinary irony, she can sneer at it, or argue with anti-sound and scorners, but the words of the nightingale make her a word. Can't say it. In addition to the weak accusations, other words are like nails, piercing her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When still wandering in the East, everyone really spent a lot of energy to survive. Every day, she is like a mouse that doesn't see light. She holds copper pieces and looks for other lost copper eagle, and then changes into bread and other food. If she is alone, she can live in any town, but there are many companions behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the harvest of the day is not enough, everyone can only go hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akima does not believe that she is weak, otherwise she will not have the courage to leave her home and go to the unknown territory alone; it is also impossible to recognize so many partners. And become their leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that the night owl is right. Since the meeting, her group has gradually lost its independence. After all, relying on the ability to get the money to survive, those fighting witches are much faster to start with the mouse. If you are lucky, the coins you get in one day will be enough to get past her half-monthly busy. Her guidance is only needed when walking through the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party’s powerful combat power is a safety guarantee for everyone, so that she no longer cares about how many copper eagle in her pocket, enough to buy The food you need along the way, or whether you can support a commission with the caravan. After converging with the major forces, this situation has not changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Akima cried his teeth and said, "How hard is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I don't know the specific amount of living funds that will be released in the future, but it should not be lower than the standard of the Witch Alliance, that is, at least one gold dragon in a month, and this is four to five times that of ordinary people." Tidy worried, "and there is more to eat and live in this income, and there is even less to spend freely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most important thing is Even if you leave the sleeping spell, the Witch Alliance can't accept you for the time being. The reason is very simple, and you don't want to see a gap between the Witch Alliance and the Sleeping Curse, and this kind of thing is very easy to misunderstand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it?" she interrupted. "One month, twenty silver wolves, everyone adds up to one hundred and twenty. She actually thinks that I am doing it." No? Don't be kidding! I am not a big lady from the aristocrat, in order to get a little food, sewers and I have been looking for the garbage, I am afraid that this is hard? No, this is nothing at all, if you don’t believe it, I will be optimistic, night! I know you are still here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Achema..." Wendy was preparing to persuade, but was dragged by Doris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you are good for us, but I also think that our previous practice was really too much. After being told by Miss Nightingale, I now feel the face. Something hot." She embarrassedly touched her red cheeks and whispered, "Maybe Hetty Morgan does not take everyone seriously, as she said, but we can't continue this way. This I support Ajima's decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am also, if Akima is weak, what are we?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I decided, I want to leave the sleeping spell - not only to survive, but also to return the owed to them!" Qima hated the room, "You will wait to swallow the words you have said, night!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty sighed, silent After a long time, I said, "Since you have made a choice, I will explain it with your Highness." I will also apply to your Majesty as much as possible to keep your special salary so that you can accept the witch recruitment. Get some of the special banknotes, so life will be a lot easier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
