			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the person you recruited?" Roland looked at the group of ragged civilians, and the heart was floating up and the urge to turn around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, this is filtered according to your requirements," Carter glared at his fingers. "Male, non-criminal, 18 years old or older, under 40 years old." The body is not crippled... I have carefully examined it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, he knows that he can't hold too much expectation. After all, the productivity of the world is so low, it is a difficult thing to eat enough, and it is more normal to wear it. The treatment of being a prince made him ignore this point. As long as he walked out of the castle, he could see the displaced people who were undressed and begged for a living. In fact, even the gray kingdom of the kingdom, there will be a occupation of the corpse - what they do is to smash the hungry on the street every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the battle mode of the world? Roland closed his eyes and thought about it again, um... probably a little bit more advanced than hooligans. Generally speaking, when the lord decides to launch a war (or when the battle is over - Roland does not think that this kind of battle can be related to the word of war), he will summon the subordinate aristocrats in his jurisdiction, and then separate the nobles and then call each other. The lower-ranking aristocrats in the territory, such as the count of the Duke's summoning of the count, the count to summon the Viscount, the Baron, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These nobles mostly have a group of knights and mercenaries as their own personal strength, they are the main force of combat, basic armor is complete, weapons are excellent. At the same time, they will also recruit civilians and farmers on the ground to work together â€“ in fact, to transport the grass to the troops and to rush to the front line when they need to fill the pits. The most serious casualties in the battle are these cannon fodders. The battle between the nobles, as long as they do not die on the battlefield, will usually be taken back to the good for treatment in exchange for ransom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland naturally does not expect the aristocrats in Bianbu Town to help him fight. In fact, they have nothing to do with Bianbu Town, mostly by the Long Song Fortress Lord. The divided baron and territory are also in the area under the jurisdiction of the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A force composed entirely of civilians is a very imaginative thing in this era. They are stupid, ignorant, unable to understand the instrument, can't understand the order, and have not undergone professional combat training. How can they compare with the knight who started practicing swords from the age of ten? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter is close to Roland, whispering, "Your Highness, this is not feasible. You look at them, which one can hold the sword? Meet the evil beast I am afraid that it will be scattered, and it will affect the stability of the defense. I suggest that you should hire professional mercenaries from Liuye Town or other places to guard the walls. These people will keep some chores."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I use them," Roland refused. He didn't have any good feelings about the mercenaries who worked for the money. Besides, he formed the army not only to deal with the evil beasts - through history, a strong and vital team whose members must come from the people, whether it was feudal The army, the modern army, or the modern army have verified this law numerous times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you have the final say," the knight shrugged. "Then I will train them to train the sword tomorrow? Although it may not be useful..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the sword? No, you first take them in line and run--" Roland suddenly thought that these training contents may not have been experienced by the Cavaliers themselves, so they have to change their way. "You called the hunter you were looking for last time. Let's see how I do it together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;************ *******<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**** The incredible experience of today may be more than the previous two decades combined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He actually caught up close to the Royal Four Princes - Roland Wimbledon. He walked in front of himself and smiled at himself. God, is the prince drunk? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days ago, when the four princes spoke in the square, he knew that this winter will be different from the past. They will not go to the long song fortress, but will be here. Have a long winter. Most of the reasons the prince said, he did not understand, but for this decision, he agreed with the heart. The younger brother of **** died in the slum of the fortress two years ago. He had no food supply for a whole month. He bought some black bread and shared it with his brother by relying on several copper plates earned for unloading the dock. But that winter was too cold, and the slums in the slums were leaking everywhere. This point was not even able to maintain the body temperature. After the younger brother became comatose, he never woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
