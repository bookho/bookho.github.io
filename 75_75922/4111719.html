			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia did not go to see the result, but aimed the scope at the next target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical power of precision shooting is not static. It is common to want to hit the harder to hit the target, the more magical it costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means the magic of one or two hours to support the bow or throwing stone weapon. It can only support about half an hour and a half at such a long distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She must play as many bullets as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability responded to her will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia feels that she is not shooting, but dancing in the wind. Everything is so coordinated, the adjustment of the muzzle, the pitch of the arm, and every movement of the body seem to be all in one with the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the frequency of each breath being fired, Andrea quickly fired all ten bullets and then replaced it with a new one. The whole process is flowing, like a well-thought-out performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the stone wall is far from being so relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of death is flying against the forces of Ampein, but they still know nothing about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight who commanded the mercenary to adjust to the crash became the first victim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range of these fighters is more than two hundred steps, and the arrow created by cast iron can easily penetrate the big shield and the Knight A. It is the best weapon for defending the palace. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to withstand the monster warriors who are powerful, Ampe moved all the stocks in the warehouse to the wall. A total of eight downtimes were placed on the wall of the Rising Sun Avenue. Considering the limited width of the street, even if the attacker is stronger, it is difficult to escape the shovel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenary only heard a muffled sound of "噗", and saw that the knight’s chest, which was still giving orders, was recessed, and the body leaned back. He fell to the ground without a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone sneaked!" The wall immediately sounded a warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people pulling out their swords, but no one can find out where the attack came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is the second, third--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Death swarms, defenders There are always people falling, and the enemy has never appeared. An indescribable fear shrouded their minds, and it was not a rare thing for the warriors to be bloody, but waiting for them to be killed is another matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;especially a few mercenaries who are particularly confident about their skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found that the increasingly hard-working skills were useless, and the other party did not even give a face-to-face chance, whether it was a clumsy servant or an experienced one. The Cavaliers, there is no difference in such an attack without any warning. If Hermes had at least let them see the enemy, this battle is simply waiting for the name of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is not enough, there are twenty bodies on the wall, plus the sorrow of the unfortunate, the will of most people It was soon on the verge of collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for cover, there are witches nearby!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the command of the chief knight Let everyone come back a little, "You can avoid the attack by hiding your body in the wall and the coffin! In addition, you will take out the penalty arrow and shoot in a possible direction, and force the damn guy. Come out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia also noticed the changes on the stone wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knight wearing a gold-rimmed armor seems to be directing the situation on the scene, and people are constantly moving closer to him and using various obstacles as a cover to blindly face the surroundings. Throwing arrows, and some even throwing them out by hand, the purpose is self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
