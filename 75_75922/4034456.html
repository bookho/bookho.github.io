			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning, Roland just came to the command post with breakfast and received a report from McMug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The church is out!" The voice of the magic stone came from her excited voice. "A team left the cold wind and is marching toward the defense!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One, two, three... a total of five ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland, who is preparing for the frontline battle meeting, sat back again, "What? Five?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"And wearing a golden jewel, holding the flag of the Holy City, very arrogant! Need to report the artillery mark?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...No You will continue to stare at the cold wind ridge." He stuffed the bread into his mouth, what did the church want to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably to beg for mercy?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case, the Holy City should not send a large army to occupy the cold winds." Roland frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day and a half, the squad reached the front line of the line of defense, and the headed priest claimed that they were the messengers sent by the church and wanted to see Roland’s side, while still There is a personal letter from His Majesty the Pope who wants to hand over to the young King of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" Roland gathered the staff and the witch and asked, "Is this a pure trick?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before, I want to ask your opinion first," said Itis first. "If the church wants to surrender, would you accept them for peace talk?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not hesitate to veto this possibility, "unless they disbanded the Prisoners, and handed over all the high-level and innocent people to trial. But I don't think the church will accept such a condition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed," Isis immediately replied, "then you should not meet the messenger. Regardless of whether the other party has a conspiracy, the negotiation process may also shake your resolve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree with this view," Aegusa nodded, "although There is no magic reaction in these five people, but the witch's ability is very strange, and no one can guarantee what will happen next."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or simply grab them and torture them, ask them clearly and secretly solve them," the iron axe made a cut-throat gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, Grey Fort is not an iron sand city," Sir Sirte quickly advised. "Do not do this kind of thing better. Passing out will hurt you." "The reputation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Roland looked at the iron axe after a moment of meditation. "Let them leave the letter, and people will drive away." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following, squatting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t help but be curious, at this time, Hermes What does the supreme ruler of Sri Lanka say to him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it an advisory or a temptation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a series of checks by Sylvie and Aegusa, the letter written by the Holy City Pope was delivered to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unpacking the beautiful cover, the handwriting on the letterhead is unexpectedly beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the letter surprised Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is a candid account of the origin and purpose of the church, and reveals the existence of the human enemy - the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for him that he knew the secrets of four hundred years ago, it might be enough to make him feel confused and incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the strategy that the enemy wants to come up with? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, when the first team returned, the cold wind ridge sent another team of people, also five people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland naturally did not meet them, but left the letter alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of this letter is more in-depth. In addition to a brief introduction to the predecessor federation of the church, the word "the war of divinity" is even mentioned. The Pope believes that this alien war of four hundred years is the test of the gods to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sneered at this point of view, but his heart was inexplicably a little uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the week, Han Fengling sent several messenger groups to send the Pope’s personal letter to the frontline camp. These letters did not reveal too much new things, and the content is getting shorter and shorter. As for the suggestion that the back of the letterhead hopes to cooperate on both sides against the devil, he only turned a blind eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City did not send a new messenger until the arrival of the hot summer season. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the enemy was dispatched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is lightning, the enemy has entered the 9th area! Repeat, the enemy has entered the 9th area!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the sound of the seal, the cat The claws twirled the book in his hand, "Hey... No. 9, No...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry up!" Rodney snarled, "cannonballs Already installed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is already the fastest!" Cat Claw, "Ah... here, angle twenty-six, pitching fifteen !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelson quickly shakes the handle, "Twenty-six...15, complete!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Preparation for shooting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the order, the cat's claw quickly caught his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pomelo peel pulls the fire rope, and the 152mm fortress can be shocked instantly. The roar of the human heart, the sound of the waves mixed with the airflow, like a hammer hitting the chest of the cat's claws, so that he could not help but boil, and under the huge recoil, he felt the earth on the soles of his feet tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the power, the cat claws think, compared to the short 12-pound small iron pipe, the fortress gun is a weapon suitable for men to operate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only regret is that he can't see the scene when the shells landed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courage, the cat's claws are tied to the magic stone in the hands of Sylvie, "Hey... Miss Lightning, are we hitting?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...the middle goal," the little girl replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning and wheat can be more direct than the rear gunners Observed the enemy's movements and the blows suffered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She floats at an absolutely safe height, holding the gazebo down overlooking, just a grenade shot in the west of the 9th area, with the expected The drop point is almost four meters wide, probably due to the impact of wind changes. But the actual effect is not bad, the church's mighty army fills the entire mountain road, as long as it can reach the head of the team, you can immediately see a scarlet flower bloom instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same blow was just the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t see the process from the flight to the landing. The first thing that caught the eye was a dark red glow, followed by a high smoke and Sand and gravel, a flash of ripples spread from the light, and the dust everywhere. The sound of the explosion will only be passed after a while, as if the two were not at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the smoke was blown away, there was only one piece of burnt black in the center of the drop, and the surrounding body was a dead body with broken limbs everywhere. Slimy organs and blood stained the bright armor with a touch of bright red. The farther trial warriors are another look. They don’t seem to have any obvious scars on their bodies, but they still vomit their blood and fall to the ground. Some can still go out for a few meters before they fall. The twisting pace is like drinking. Drunk in general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
