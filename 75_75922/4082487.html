			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of sorcerer can enter the world of dreams by interrupting consciousness, thus obtaining a complete body and feelings, which is already for the survivors who are still in the third side of the city. Everything is known. More than once, Roland said that Felice had said that whenever she returned to the bottom of the earth, she would be questioned by her companions. The content was basically about the experience of the dream, and she couldn’t wait to express her feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other ways to restore perception, and will they voluntarily integrate soul with carrier as before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the latter is not without merit, at least the dream world can only be experienced when he sleeps, and the carrier’s feelings are always there. And if the body is not damaged, it is almost eternal life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is probably not so easy to make a decision between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the other party has a choice, that is, the message of concealing the world of dreams first, after the instrument is shipped, the conversion is performed first, even if it is reluctant afterwards, I have repented. It is only Roland who thinks that Pasha and others will not adopt this deceptive approach. After more than a month of getting along, he found that although these people have been isolated for hundreds of years, they have not become an organization that is not justified. I have a positive attitude towards new things, and I have indeed eliminated the class from each other. Obviously, the sacrifice of the three seats of the federation touched them a lot, and the threat of the devil forced them to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to worry about this," Pasha saw his thoughts. "More carriers are good for defeating the devil - the original carrier can operate The core of magic, devour worms can speed up the construction of defense lines, as long as they are conducive to the battle of God, they will not hesitate. In fact, the witches involved in the transformation will go to Daxueshan with the instrument."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women who are not afraid of any price... Roland snorted. "It seems that I am really worried. When the exploration is completed, I will send a fleet to transport the conversion equipment. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your help," she smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded and spread the picture drawn by Soroya to the table. "The information sent back was just a textual clue. These pictures were sent today. In my hands - they can be seen as a real reproduction of the scene, I wonder if you have any opinion on this monster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please wait a moment." Pasha Waving With the next tentacles, Catherine and Elsie, who had repaired the sacred instruments not far away, also called, and the three sarcomas together gathered in front of the light curtain to look at the lifelike "continuous photos." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the silence was unexpectedly long, they connected the tentacles, communicated consciously, and the sarcoma itself did not show any expression, Roland even produced The illusion that they have broken the line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Pasha’s voice reappeared in his mind, “Let you wait, because there are some pictures that surprise us. So I have to confirm it again and again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is neither a beast nor a devil, right?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Catherine said. "And the skeleton that fell into the water had appeared in the realm of the narratives of Nataya."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you be sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have been in the ground for hundreds of years, but there is no dementia to forget The important news - the memory of the carrier is actually far more than humans." Aerna did not have a good air, "Nataya had seen the sea and the skeleton in the third picture, from the description, and the picture The picture on the scene is very close. With the lake leading to the sea, this judgment is more credible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, now it is certain that it is indeed That had never appeared in civilization? "Asked Roland rubbed his chin. He was not surprised by the result. When the worm was swallowed and the devil camp was not spared, there was only two possibilities behind the forces, either to see the neutrals who were not pleasing to the eye, or to be divine. The last party of the battle. In addition to helping the side of the Takula, the Snow Mountain Project itself is an action to clear the threat and find out the details of the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the memory fragments of Jieluo, he also read similar records, but the story is very vague, now with the confirmation of the Takira witch, Almost able to confirm the true identity of the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
