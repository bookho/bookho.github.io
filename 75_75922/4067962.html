			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next afternoon, Roland received a report on the ability of Shelen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So fast?" He raised a brow and took the test form from Wendy. "Have she accepted herself as a witch?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, and more calm than we expected," Wendy smiled and told the meeting last night. "I have to say that her parents taught." An excellent child.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s so...” Roland can’t help but feel a bit moving. In this era, someone can think about it for so long, and it’s already a pioneer. . Probably history has also been promoted - when beliefs are passed on to future generations, the number of people who have this pursuit is increasing, and until it reaches a certain level, the world will undergo earth-shaking changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire of the stars can be restored, and the same is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanity may be step by step toward civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked carefully at the test process and the magic judgment. As a witch who was awakened at the age of fifteen, Xuelun’s magical cyclone was at the upper-middle level. The report even states that this level is comparable to some of the adult witches of Takira. It seems that when doing the ability test, Felice is also on the scene - as long as there is a new witch, she is the most active one in the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherron’s ability to generate electricity, but Wendy’s description of this part is vague, and it is clear that the electrical part is still a difficult one in elementary physics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she increases the current intensity, the magical power will increase rapidly, but the current is like a thunder, which can easily penetrate the board and burn the iron. When changing back to a weaker current, you must touch the object to be effective, you can light the bulb, but it is easy to burn the filament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Xuelun was just awakened, the control of the magic is very unstable. Wendy’s conclusion is that the fighting witch has the potential to assist production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not intend to re-test, after all, there is no tool for determining voltage or current at all, even if you know these parameters, you can't get accurate values. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, when she releases high-voltage current, her magic consumption is quite large, and the continuity of transmission is obviously not as good as the dawn of the mystery. As for the electromagnetic gun, what is more? Forget it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last important point is that whether it’s Anna’s black fire or the snow’s current, it’s a magical effect that doesn’t necessarily match Related theory. Only when the ability is secondarily transformed into other effects can you be familiar with the knowledge he is familiar with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, this is a very promising ability, especially how to evolve after understanding the nature of the current, and how much magic will be gained in adulthood, It is a problem worth looking forward to. As for now, according to Wendy's suggestion, let her practice while doing her own work, and catch up with everyone's progress as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that Shelen has such a strong sense of justice, it seems to be quite good for her to join the Ministry of Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young girl who can discharge, constantly patrolling the streets, and ready to catch criminals, this feeling is really ... very familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Roland didn’t say what he thought, he nodded to Wendy. “Just do it, trouble you.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my pleasure, Your Majesty," Wendy stroked her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, Roland returned to the office and found that in addition to the nightingale There are more Lily and mystery. The three people were around the desk, as if they were arguing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at this," the nightingale waved at him. "Oh my God, it’s exactly the same!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is exactly the same? Roland walked curiously to the table and noticed that there were two pots of bird-shaped mushrooms on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
