			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You...what are you talking about?" Speer said incredulously, "The devil's minions? This is the red-naked fall!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it a fall, the priests have their own conclusions," said the man who was called Redwin, "The father will be blinded by you, not representing You can blind everyone! Soon the people will know your true face, hell is your return!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this all made up by you? Speer’s tone suddenly cooled down. “Is there still someone else? I think the answer should be the latter. After all, the reason why my father chose me is not because of anything else, but that you and the three brothers are really too useless. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the night owl heard a crisp sound, and the woman The marquis of the marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough, take her back to the church for trial," the other person said. "Before the trial was not carried out, she was still a nobleman, don't lose the etiquette. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Speer Passy was towed away, the trial warrior followed, and there were only two people left in the room. Due to the influence of the stone of God's punishment, the nightingale could not see their appearance, and only one of them could distinguish from the voice that Redwin was talking to the lord before. If he did not misunderstand, this person seems to be Sper's younger brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You performed well, Mr. Redwin... Maybe when I meet next time, I should call you the Earl."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, is this all right, Rosade," Redwin’s tone is mixed with uncontrollable excitement. "I can really inherit the title and become a dragon." The lord of the ridge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, as long as you follow our agreement, even further is possible," the latter laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do next?" he eagerly said, "Can I move to the old lady's room? She can't come out of prison again." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spell Passy will soon be hanged in the square as a witch, which is a guarantee of our cooperation," The other party has been indulging for a moment. "As for what to do next, I suggest that you summon her ministers, knights and subordinates, tell them about it, and divide some of the rights belonging to the Marquis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1...Do you have to do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If everyone can benefit from the event Your position will be much more stable, which will facilitate the smooth progress of our subsequent agreements," Rosad said. "If you feel that you are at a loss, I can send a priest to you. He is very good at handling government affairs. You If you don't understand, he can always reply."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That please," Redwin was quick to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can sit down and take the position of the Lord, and it will be of great help to us, so this kind of thing is naturally responsible." The other party laughed loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two left, the nightingale emerged from the fog, and lightning and wheat fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is troublesome," she looked at the two. "How can the church come to the door so easily?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not that her brother discovered her true identity and then revealed it to the church.” Lightning eyes stunned. “We have something to do.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't find out late, but I don't think it is right now? I always feel that something is wrong here," the nightingale frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, we must not watch them squirrel," said Lightning. "You must save her and kill the church." Falling flowers and water!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flowering water!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of defeating the devil, the confidence of the blonde girl The heart is a little inflated, this is not a good signal. The nightingale shook his head. "There is no time to defeat the church. This conspiracy must have their participation. If you remove this group of people, Speer can naturally return to the position of the lord. This may be an opportunity for us, as long as she is quiet Surviving silently, in the face of nowhere to go, she is likely to agree to return to Bianbu Town with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Battle is a last resort. The number of opponents is large. There are also a lot of stones for the punishment of the gods. The risk of quickly clearing the opponent is quite high." After thinking for a while, the nightingale said, "I will go to the church to find out the situation. I can't figure out what is going on here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing she didn't say, if she doesn't understand the cause and effect, Speer Passy may be I will associate this frame with my Highness, and this kind of thing must be avoided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about us?" asked the little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s good to meet me outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Longling Church is located in the outer city. It is small in size and has a prayer hall, a believer's residence and a three-story tower with a wall and a single entrance. But for the nightingale, these obstacles are not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the evening, after the believers who came to pray, she has touched the entire area - although the number of stones It’s several times more in the castle, but it’s not easy. There is a large stone in the hall that is enough to ban the magic of the whole room. Some aisles are also the same, but she can completely detour and even cross the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale also found the position where Speer Passy was imprisoned, just in the basement of the tower, it did not seem to suffer any torture, but the spirit was somewhat Wilted. She plans to wait until the dead of night, and then take the female marquis out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After telling the story to the two, the nightingale re-sneaked into the tower, this time she went straight to the top line along the lines that did not exist in reality. It is hidden in a beautifully decorated room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be the priest’s room. When he comes back, the threat of facing the dagger should be honest about the truth of the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bell at 9 o'clock in the evening echoed over the dragon's ridge, the door of the room was pushed open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quietly pulled out the dagger, but did not act, judging from the footsteps, there were two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The joy of the accident," the first thing to talk about is a woman. "I didn't expect Marquis Sper is really a witch. It seems that the plan must be slightly changed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...the ambassador," the answerer was the former Rosard, his tone was very respectful, "She is the witch's words." Isn't it more convincing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now is different from the past, according to the meaning of the Pope, if there is a new witch, without exposure It should be handed over to the Holy City as much as possible," the woman said. "As for the original hanging, change it to fire, and replace it with a masked death row of almost the same size."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Rosad answered. "But why should you set such a troublesome rule? It is not easy to transport a witch to Hermes."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, but listen to the above, this is just a return to tradition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Return to...Traditional?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to know too much, you can do it well with peace of mind," the ambassador did not continue to say, "Wait until the disposal here." I am going to Chishui City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow!" Rosade sounded a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is this person? Why did the priest not dare to come out in front of her? And listening to the dialogue between the two, it seems that they did not know that the female Marquis was a witch before catching Speer Passy. Is this a conspiracy against the position of the Lord of the Dragon Ridge from beginning to end? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale couldn’t help but walk out of the hiding place and look at the other side with the fog. To her surprise, the other party did not wear the stone of punishment. In the black and white world, the magic of the sacred body is as bright as fluorescence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is a witch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
