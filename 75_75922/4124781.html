			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a person on the couch, the pad suddenly bent a lot and made a squeaky sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the store is reminded to reinforce this thing a bit, Victor thinks, although the big bed is in the corner of the room, but sometimes not everything It has to be done in bed, and there is often something unexpected that can be changed in a different place - the pubs here are still less than the two kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Linglong has packed up the drinks and spread the newspapers in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Victor couldn’t help but brow, and saw that the paper was neatly covered with dense letters, just like the ones in his family. Classics! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been self-confident in his eyes, and most of the world’s strange things have not only been seen, but even played by himself. Usually a product is placed in front of him, he can immediately judge the value of its geometry, but the newspaper has made Victor feel hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a neat and meticulous handwriting is unlikely to be handwritten. In other words, it is based on stereotyped imprinting technology - To the latter's cost, producers generally only use it in important and rarely modified dossier books, such as the Kingdom Code. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is also here. In order to achieve the best embossing effect, this kind of book will put the best materials into the best possible material. The small lambskin can only be regarded as the basic requirement. There are many jewels on the cover with gold rims. When highlighting the extraordinary, it must also ensure sufficient durability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is this newspaper? The paper is obviously ordinary gray paper, which is different in thickness and water. It has no cover, no corners and no protection measures. Even if it is read normally, it cannot be seen several times. For him, the move is like putting a night pearl into the iron ingot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor couldn’t help but think of what the maid said before – the king’s intention to use this instead of a publicity announcement means that it will print a new one in the future. The content comes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After asking the doubts in his heart, he got a positive answer from the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the announcement said at the time that the newspaper would issue a single issue every other week, and the number would only increase, ensuring that most people could see it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and only a ten copper eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to wonder how much wealth Roland had searched for in Hermes - this kind of thing that was lost at a time, the other party still wanted Have you done it for a long time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, there is a gemstone merchant who may have a business opportunity in it. At this moment, the idea has been wiped out without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take him, Victor secretly swears, anyway, it’s not his money, what is the other party’s profit? Still concentrate on reading the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this in mind, he moved his eyes to the first page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top is a line that adds bold title: "Graycast Weekly." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next full-page content is the news that the king is about to ascend the throne, and that the morning kingdom and the gray fort will form a covenant against the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things have long been heard, but only to the extent that they know that there is such a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With just two sweeps, Victor was completely immersed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above content actually gives him a feeling of holding his breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the first time to look at the description of these two major events from a high-level perspective in such a detailed manner, unlike the gossip that was circulated in the streets and the streets. With precise time and place, causes, processes and results, they also explain the reasons for their occurrence. In particular, the morning covenant part of the covenant - the distrust of the royal family of Moya, the rebellion of the nobility, and the letter of help from the thousands of miles, all of which ultimately constituted the reason for the gray castle to send troops. After the three major families turned their backs, the new Dawn Lord is willing to rebuild the kingdom order with Roland Wimbledon as a matter of course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
