			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the high voice of the people, Roland looked at the second boat with satisfaction The cement boat also slipped into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two cement vessels seem to be simple in construction, and in fact have made considerable progress compared to the original township number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time it has added a dense steel frame, the quality of the cement has also improved a lot, the overall strength is several times higher than the town number. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in order to speed up the construction, Roland has reserved the card slot and interface for installing the steam engine, transmission mechanism and paddle wheel when designing the hull. The corresponding fixing pins are welded on the metal parts to achieve quick splicing, and the installation is like a bonding model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the template has also been changed from a temporary piece of masonry to an iron mold, which not only ensures the compactness of the concrete, but also improves its waterproof performance. It is basically the same for every ship, so as to avoid deviations when installing the power system. In order to get a complete template, he scrapped at least seven or eight test items. Fortunately, cement is no longer a scarce product. From grinding stones to mixing into kiln, steam engines have replaced human work. Some industrial projects that can be produced on a large scale without relying on the power of witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sufficient materials, reliable formwork, and skilled workers, only the hardening rate of cement is limited by the hull production. However, under the accelerated response capability of white paper, the cement ship that originally needed to be placed for one or two months can be launched in one day. In other words, as long as Roland is willing, the shipyard can completely launch a whiteboard ship in two or three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the steam engine manufacturing speed and crew training can keep up, he can have a huge shipping fleet in a short time, so that the entire Chishui River is full of local Arranged with their own cement boat, the legendary dumplings are no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the charm of industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hull is now in place, and the next job is to install the power components. These mechanical equipment are basically the same as those of the Crescent Bay Chamber of Commerce. The craftsmen have already practiced. Experience, so he is not worried about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't understand, why do you want to tell the people about this kind of thing?" asked the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to promote national strength." Roland smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean, witnessing the earth-shaking changes in the town." I felt the chin. "Before you haven't seen the town, I'm afraid I won't expect the stone boat to float on the water. The idea of ​​the people is also the same. After the impossible things are realized, they are for the town. The sense of identity will be higher and higher – this kind of mentality is all-encompassing, and may even evolve into nothing that they can't do.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not... too clear." The sound of the nightingale was a bit confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can understand it as a means of propaganda." Roland laughed. The days when the nobility and the people celebrated this era were only during the celebrations or major events, but the two were basically related to the nobility. If the porridge water was not distributed free of charge, the participation of the people was not high. The cement ship is the result of the collective collaboration of hundreds of workers, and they themselves are part of the festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, as a member of the territory, after seeing the miracle that the territory continues to produce, self-confidence and identity will gradually increase, which is what the later generations call "The mentality of a big country", the strength of a territory, will inevitably lead to a positive change in the mentality of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later, Roland met in the castle hall to apply for the captain’s job. More than ten townspeople. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of Barov’s reporting, he was still amazed. I did not expect that there were so many “high-end talents” among the refugees in the town. In the detailed report, I was dumbfounded. Among the recruits, there were no shortage of fishermen who operated rafts and small fishing boats, and even boatmen who made a living by ferry. In a sense, they also really have the experience of having a "captain". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
