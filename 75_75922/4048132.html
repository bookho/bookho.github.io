			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jordan finally listened to Hill’s opinion, and left the Glow City in a carriage under the glory of the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driving guys are all under the hands of Hill. I heard that people who were also Acrobatic Troupes have been confident in the evacuation route after following several slave transports with the caravan. . Until the sun completely went down, the team's degree slowed down, but even if the earth was shrouded in the night, they insisted on taking the oil lamp to continue for more than an hour before they rushed down in a wild field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vehicle became a circle around the bonfire, the young man who claimed to be a clown skillfully took the water porridge, and the tall, strong-faced rock mountain fed the horse, and The magician responsible for vigilance and patrolling, and the Jom brothers who dug simple traps...not so much acrobatics, they are more like an army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About now, I don’t have to do anything, and the fragrant wheat porridge has already been handed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, there is a plate of bacon and an apple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally knows why Hill chose to ship these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole two cars of food, even if they have to spend a month or two on the road, these so-called "selling goods" are enough to cope with all the staff. need. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but can load the food so quickly, is he always ready to flee the dawn kingdom at any time? And listening to the guardian's statement, he still keeps in touch with the Black Street mouse, God... Is this guy really just an acrobat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the decision to return to the Grey Fort, I must find an old friend to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guys consciously took the porridge to the outside of the carriage, leaving him and the 76th and four witches next to the campfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry for the last words and deeds," Annie said broadly. "You really didn't give us to the Lord of the Morning, but I still can't." I believe in you completely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Mia did not understand. "He doesn't look like a bad person."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is not a bad person to make the appointment slightly blush, he never felt that he is a good person, but the light of the fire can cover this for him, "cough, I think it is probably because of Anne. Miss still doubts the purity of the Grey Fort Witch organization?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pureness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For example, some powerful aristocrats often steal a few witches for fun--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just one aspect," Anne interrupted. As long as there is unilateral deception and exploitation, whether it is in the wolf heart or in the gray fort, it is a cage for the witch, and there is no essential difference. Of course, if you can confirm the gray The witch organization does, as you said, I will apologize to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter," Joel shrugged, "My task is to You sent it to Roland, and then it has nothing to do with me. Even if you want to apologize, you may not see me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere at the scene Some stiff, only the snoring of the bonfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s normal, he won’t let the chat get stuck, but for this group of witches, he can’t really get up, not only disturbing his calm ambassador. Life also brings a lot of risks to the messenger group - careful not to be wrong, but when the suspected person is replaced by himself, this feeling is not so easy to let people feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last opening to break the silence is the 76th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you all from the wolf kingdom?" she asked. "I heard Mia say, you have known for a long time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny nodded. "Although we were not born in the same city,...you didn't guess wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wolf Has been annexed by the church, you have to escape to the morning sun, you should have experienced a lot of hardships," on the 76th, leaned over and touched the hero's empty trousers, and lowered his voice and asked, "Her legs are also in the process of fleeing, Was the church person hurt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
