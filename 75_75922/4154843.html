			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five days later, Farina and Joe received a notice from the First Army Liaison on the way to transport the goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief commander of the army wanted to meet them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way to the Cangshan command post, into the conference room, Farina found that there is more than one person - from the shoulder badge, these officers They are all high-level figures of the First Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy swallowed nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fahina looked calm and gave a military ceremony to everyone. "Farina, the member of the first transport brigade, came to report."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axe Axe and others smiled and returned, there is no shelf for the superior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can't help but surprise her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style of the Hermes Church made her accustomed to neglecting the gap between the classes and straightforward ways. I didn’t expect the upper level of the Grey Fort military to be the same, even There is nothing beyond it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is calm because she has no conscience, and does not mean that she has forgotten that she was the "criminal identity" of the church trial army - even if it is scorned, it seems that there is nothing. It’s weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no contempt for the people, even the church, can not be so friendly to non-Christians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if you notify me...what is it?" Farina’s gaze finally fell on the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember the Yongdong Knight you caught in Shenchi Bay a few days ago?" The iron axe opened the door and saw the mountain. "We have confirmed the identity of the other party. And the crimes committed by the two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina suddenly realized what was "they were important to the First Army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes is not." The iron axe slowly said, "For the entire situation, they are not worth mentioning, but for those who have dedicated their lives to this war, Their embarrassment means that the prisoner has not been able to escape the sanctions after all, so that they can finally comfort those victims."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then then Farina heard a blood test The story of intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, the news of the stakeholders did not attract the attention above. After all, the fugitives trying to get out of this way can meet three or four times a day. . They are either small aristocrats or businessmen with considerable wealth. The reason for escape is nothing but a crime or fear of property being searched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Luo Jia’s report, the two permanent winter knights apparently belong to the former category, but because the blood tastes complex and intense, the interrogators also found more Be careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a psychological game and a confession, the younger brother took the lead and couldn’t help but give up the things that the two had committed – as early as a few months ago, the brothers The two took the lord's command to catch the evacuees around the city, but because of the revenge of the elder brother and the gray castle, they finally hated and captured the hunted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just an ordinary murder, it’s just a matter of death and mining, and the “hunting the escaping” will leave the higher authorities responsible for approval and filing. Heart. Eventually the case was handed over to the intelligence department, led by Hill Fox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the case has two biggest blind spots. First, the First Army has not yet known who the sender of the information is, and only knows that the deceased is a black money person. Second, considering the arbitrariness of the other party's murder, even if it is really related to blood-staining information, the two may not be able to recognize it. In other words, even if the night is present, it is impossible to determine the relationship between the two through the true and false of the language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only breakthrough seems to be the blood taste of the wolf woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Loja can only confirm the variety of blood types, and it is difficult to accurately identify the taste that is too long--in the end, the sense of smell is only the result of her transformation ability. The extra benefits, though not affected by the gods themselves, cannot surpass the limits of the physiological structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the ability to break the sword, Vanilla found the same pheromone on the leg of the Talos Morrie with the blood of the secret letter - although it was only a trivial point, it was a sure testament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the two have never met, how can they be contaminated with the same pheromone? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Murray brothers must be the murderer of the killer of the intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There were such people in the original civilians..." After listening to the explanation of the iron axe, Joe couldn't help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The current kingdom of the winter is still the devil's occupied area, so we can't publicize it like other heroes, but history will not forget things like him. People." The iron axe sighed. "You are the main hero of the murderer, but they are not in the army. So I am looking for you to tell the results of the investigation, and it is the beginning and the end. The rest is to ask, you I hope to get what kind of reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we didn't have much effort." Farina said bluntly, "The first thing I noticed was the witch. Miss, I just heard the movement of their fight, and finally made up a wrench."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement caused a good laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, Roland will never miss anyone who has merit," Iron Axe explained. "The Witch Alliance and the Army are two departments, so Miss Luo Jia. The reward is someone else's responsibility. In theory, your reward should also be issued by the Executive Office, but the front line of the battlefield can only be handled by Jane, so we can ask for it on our behalf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I understand..." Farina was hesitating for a moment. "I used to be the judge of the church and was blinded by false lies, but if I can, I hope to get a chance to make up for my fault." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take up the fault?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." She took a deep breath, "Join the first An army is the reward I want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room suddenly quieted down, everyone looked around and seemed to be exchanging opinions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the iron axe opened the door. "The rules of the first army’s recruitment were made by His Majesty. I can’t promise you." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." Farina’s slightly clenched fist suddenly loosened a few points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However," the other party turned and said, "I can put your merits and requirements into the report and submit it to you." If you insist Such a thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina looked up and her eyes lit up. "Yes, please!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She naturally knows that once joined the army, all future actions will be more constrained, and the risk of facing the enemy will multiply, but that is the road she is craving - the more the road is full of thorns, she The more you can compensate for the sins you have committed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina and Joe left, other officers also dispersed, no In the meeting room for a while, only the iron axe and the Itis were left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Northland Pearl, which has never been heard, has grown a sigh of relief. "So, the Hermes Church is really terrible... Since it has not been pronounced, there is What crimes and faults, preferring to suffer in exchange for psychological peace, I am afraid that only believers in the Holy City will have such quirks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a shrug of thought, he knew very early that Isis was a savvy self-interest, and occasional concessions were also for greater interests. When the interests are the same, she is an impeccable partner, and when the interests are reversed, what she will give birth is hard to predict. A decision like Falinka's self-dedication to self is absolutely impossible to appear on the North Pearl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he does not dislike this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with those who are dull, arrogant or greedy, the former can at least distinguish their true goals, and will not make a slap in the face of short-sightedness. Stupid things come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
