			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fort, no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland flipped through the report of the report sent back to the front line and couldn’t help but clench his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong, squat?" The nightingale on the side noticed his change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...nothing," he leaned back on the back of his chair and exhaled. "Everyone’s performance is beyond my imagination, I am just "Happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" The night fell, and then smiled. "It seems that they are all working hard."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Roland got up and poured two chaotic drinks and handed them to the nightingale. "They really worked hard..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a casual word, but his real thoughts at the moment. If it is not personally coming along, it is difficult for him to contact the current First Army and the original border guard with a wooden gun. Together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to eight days of high-intensity operations, still able to maintain the strategic retreat of the formation, the cover coordination of air-ground operations, and actively seek to win the key on the battlefield The will, all of which proves how amazing the growth of this army is. In addition, Dawn's strong cooperation and migration democracy left behind to assist the military logistics, and also let him see the transformation of humanity as a whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one that surprised Roland most was Itis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although many of her previous actions have long been shown to be extremely extraordinary, this time the surprise of the accident can be said to be more than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the powerful carrying capacity of the steam truck, the mobile warfare was carried out in the territory of the wolf heart, and the characteristics of the long-range and powerful power of the fortress gun were fully exerted. This has been a faint blitz. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention the initiative to evacuate the city, so that the enemy’s extended defense line is full of loopholes, and then the high maneuver force will attack its weak point of warfare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Army can eliminate the devil’s massive power at such a small cost, and keep the pace of their advancement in the two or three hundred kilometers outside the Red Mist Zone, the staff The overall strength of the team is undoubtedly the most significant one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Roland had talked with Northland Pearl about the future form of warfare and the evolution of mechanical equipment to the war situation, it did not involve specific equipment types. - He has high hopes for "armored vehicles" and still stays in the factory as a tractor. Itis can think of the trucks that are used for transportation. This vision is definitely an inter-generational one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of individual and collective power has this hard-won victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil’s actions are now firmly contained, and the newly recruited soldiers and supplies of the First Army are constantly being transported through the aorta to the front line. This has changed the trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After saving to the top, the real counterattack will begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland and the nightingale gently clink glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of mankind appears to shine at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After drinking the drink, he returned to his desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the practice of the First Army Report, the good news is followed by various exposed problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These problems are often only solved by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, with high-intensity maneuvering, it is a distressing loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first place in the report - due to the uncertainty on the battlefield, the longer the team members stay around the faulty vehicle, the greater the risk. In the absence of tools and repair environment, two people can only deal with simple faults such as punctures and water leaks. In the face of the relatively easy problem of suspension and transmission system, there is almost no way. Therefore, most steam trucks can only be removed after the anchor is broken, and the car body is discarded on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to improve this situation, the First Army not only needs a special support force, but also has to establish related repair and maintenance sites, just like an empty knight. Field maintenance vehicles and trailers are undoubtedly a necessity to be included in the production schedule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once again vividly felt that the desire to put these large machines into the battlefield is not just that simple, the resources and money that are engulfed behind them are not A divided kingdom can afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to applying for more steam trucks, the military’s top executives expressed a strong desire for 75mm field guns and general machine guns, and statistics show that they The addition of the first army has greatly improved the firepower projection level of the First Army. If it is not necessary to consume a large amount of ammunition, they are almost perfect weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this summary of "seemingly touting, but actually asking for money," Roland was moved and then approved the military application. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the report, it was a personal letter from Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He guessed that the content inside is probably the same as the military, not to urge a special machine, or to demand more production of the skyfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brother, I haven't seen you for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should haven't forgotten to promise me?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now the devil's offensive has gradually weakened. This year, the evil moon can basically pass through safely. I will take the time to return to the winter city without a glimpse. I hope that at that time." Seeing it really looks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Roland couldn’t help but hold his forehead and knew it would be like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the overall structure of the dedicated machine has been eye-catching, and he really needs Tilly to verify the feasibility of the new body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the other person’s next words are quite different from what he thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly uses a lot of space to describe in detail the shortcomings of Tianhuo in actual combat, and even believes that the production of Tianhuo should be temporarily suspended, and then work will be started after the improvement is completed. The biggest problem is the two-seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After combining all the empty knight’s summaries and results, she found that only one of the 65 fearful beasts who confirmed the shooters came from the backseat shooter. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is also very obvious, that is, in close-range killing, the enemy does not need to end the long tail like a biplane. The madman's spear is equivalent to a pitch angle from -90 to 90 degrees, covering the 270-degree gun in front of it. As long as the distance is sufficient, it can attack on the top of the sky and the abdomen. In fact, they often drill into it. These dead corners make the rear seat shooter simply helpless. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the enemy is in the machine gun shooting, it is difficult for the shooter to determine the relative distance of the target in the air without the reference object, plus the flight route of the aircraft cannot be predicted. The hit rate is 100 meters low, often after all the bullets have returned, and they have not been able to hit an enemy. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, when the Skyfire is shooting a ground target, the rear seat can only be found in such a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weight of occupants, weapons, ammunition, and cockpit protection is real. At the same time, in order to adapt to the flight, both front and back need to complete a full set of driving training, which also makes the rear seat machine gun a very low cost performance. Tilly said bluntly in the letter that it is more like a mistake in design. If the rear cockpit is cancelled, not only can the number of empty knights be immediately turned over, but the weight saved can be applied to other places. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, more oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such as a small bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, even if there is no way to produce the improved Skyfire immediately, then at least the rear seat should be covered with a skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but smile after he got a letter, and he could fully imagine the plausible appearance of Tilly’s complaints. Although it is quite helpless to criticize the design of one's own design, the actual combat summary of the former is obviously worthy of priority in comparison with the reference materials in the dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
