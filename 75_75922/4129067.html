			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly a year of preparation, today’s Winterless City has been running at full speed like a war machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon moon can't stop this emerging king from madly absorbing peripheral resources. The Executive Office thought that 100,000 people were an unachievable goal, but only In one year, the urban population has doubled. The injection of a large amount of fresh labor has driven the rapid expansion of various industries. As a result, four new chemical plants have been added, and the processing and assembly plants related to machinery have exceeded double digits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to statistics, the monthly salary of the Executive Office is close to 10,000 Jinlong marks, and when Roland first arrived, the largest income was only 20,000. Four thousand gold dragons - after the search for a long song fortress. In other words, the Duke of the West has accumulated half a lifetime of wealth, and now only two and a half months of salary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steam engines, paddle boats, perfumes and chaotic drinks constitute the main source of revenue - these goods are sold to the fjord and the four kingdoms through the Confederation, except for the must In addition to the remuneration, the rest of the money has been turned into a large number of raw materials and handicraft products. Money has come together to form a delicate balance, and the savings in the national treasury have shown a downward trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that this is a very uneven development model, but in the face of the threat of the war of gods, Roland's choice is not plentiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the resources are not poured into heavy industry, the machine guns will not be able to shoot, and the artillery will never be able to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only then will he have the strength to arm the entire army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first army that expanded from 8,000 to 10,000 was only the foundation, and the air force under the command of Tilly Wimbledon was also actively preparing. In addition, the "Military Call for Solicitation" and the "Mobilization Act" have entered the drafting stage. These two policies aim to improve the war potential of the Winter City without forcing the basic discipline training for ordinary students, workers and farmers. University military training in later generations. Although they can't be directly put on the battlefield, they can shorten the training time when they need to replenish their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the exact time of the coming of the Red Moon has changed significantly, no one can determine when the battle of God will begin. If there is optimism, there may be four In five years, the worst should be one or two years. For Roland, the biggest strategic goal at the moment is to turn the defense into an offensive when the Red Moon arrives, so that the war is burning in enemy territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the devil who smashed the ruins of Taqila was the nail he had to remove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, material transportation and personnel transfer began gradually in the late winter and early spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of rail transit is here, even if the snow covers the entire fertile plains, as long as the track is cleared, the war will be continuously transported to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the steel produced in the winter city has become a steel rail, and the lines hidden in the hidden forest have been laid, it can be said that only When Roland is ordered, the new Northern Expedition will be officially launched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is the military or the city, it is ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before that, he still has two things to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day after the end of the evil month, Roland received a meeting with the Thunder. request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, why are you going so soon?" He set up a relaxing afternoon tea office in the living room, carrying Anna and also to Marg. Li made an invitation - for this businesswoman who is quite compatible with lightning, he can only help so much. "I can't wait to go to the shadowy waters to find out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you can't," Thunder smiled calmly. "Manipulating steel ships." Every moment, I am imagining it in the scene of the sea breeze. If I can, I even hope to sail directly to the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In that case, halfway everyone will have to face the risk of short water shortages.” Margaret shook his head helplessly. “The other group of chambers that have invested heavily in you will not be happy to let you throw their fleet. Behind you, unless you plan to never return to the fjord islands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
