			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a random guess. The history of human civilization is a perfect proof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Stone Age to the Iron Age, it took nearly a million years for humans, and from the Iron Age to the Steam Age, it was quickly shortened to 3,200 years. It took only one hundred and fifty years to move into the electrical age from the steam age, and after 50 years, it immediately ushered in the information age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the news revealed by Ai Gesha, the devil is not a race without change. More than 800 years ago, they were fighting in a similar way to humans. They were armed with bronze and cast iron to create a close-knit battle. In order to fight against witches, some high-level devils would wear the stone of gods. Every time the siege warfare, facing the long-range attack weapons such as the bows and trebuchets on the wall, the devil can hardly find any effective means of coping, and often has to pay a heavy casualty to overcome a strong city. If it is not a natural power, I am afraid that the first battle of God is the ultimate winner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the second battle of the gods, the other party has developed a magic stone that can be mass-produced, and the ethnic groups have also differentiated. The combat missions are different, and even a large number of madmen have long-range offensive means. Listening to the words of Gesha, they even created transport and engineering equipment driven by Magic Stone! Now that they have passed for more than four hundred years, what have they evolved into? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland Ben thought that Ai Gesha could bring the magic stone technology of the Tacila Quest to open up a new path of industrial development, but did not expect This technique actually comes from the enemy. As a result, the contest with the devil is likely to evolve into a war of industrial technology against the magic stone technology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who develops faster, who can win the final victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that Roland couldn’t help but sigh, it seems necessary to have a good talk with Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, Roland waited in the office for Tilly Wemble pause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very pleased to see the other person coming alone - at least in terms of trust, there has been considerable progress between the two places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Listen to the nightingale, you have something to discuss with me," she sat down and opened the door to see the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Roland handed a cup of tea to her, "mainly how to deal with the third battle of God and our future." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly took the cup and rubbed her eyes, as if waiting for him to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the words of Ai Gesha, we can see that the four kingdoms are just the corner of the light, even the wild land of the fertile plains. After defeating the hand of the devil, I had to retreat to this place. According to the time when Shimen was opened, the third battle of God was not far from us.” Roland hesitated for a moment and said bluntly, “I hope that you can stay. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly glimpsed a little, then couldn't help but smile, "I didn't expect you to say this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of the devil is unpredictable. We must gather all the forces that can gather to have a chance to win the war. Although Ai Gesha said that the first battle of gods was coordinated by mortals and witches, it is probably only Maintaining the common battle on the surface is not fundamentally different from the second battle of gods," he said in a sincere tone. "You also saw that this part of the memory in my mind holds the weapon enough to defeat the devil. Once the things inside are transformed into entities, mortals can burst Out of imagination, the witch is responsible for running the war machine, and ordinary people should be the right choice when they enter the war. At the time of the war, every single person is equal to one more strength."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Tilly took a sip of tea and delayed answering it, which made Roland's heart hang over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s useless to be in a hurry. He has a calm look on his face and waits quietly for the other person’s opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about half an hour later, Tilly sighed and broke the silence. "If I stay, what should I do with the witches who sleep on the island?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
