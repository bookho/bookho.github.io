			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About about 50 people, all dressed in armor, gleaming in the sun. The four flags in the team, three sides are the high tower double gun flag symbolizing the gray castle royal family, and one side is the high tower horse head flag, he thought about the meeting in the brain, recognized that this should be the symbol of the northern Hors family . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers walked out of the crowd and shouted: "I am Lehman Hoss, the messenger of King Tiffco, I brought the resolution of Wang Du Please put down the suspension bridge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Voucher?" Peero probed his head and asked aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party took the bow from behind and tied a paper roll to the arrow and shot it directly on the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards around him immediately took the arrow for him, and Pei opened the parchment, only to see the interlaced gold silk embedded in the lower part of the instrument, and the lower right corner covered with warm The bronze royal seal is indeed the messenger of the new king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lower the bridge, open the door." Pei Luo took a deep breath, he already guessed the contents of the so-called Wang Duo resolution - ten ** and Roland. Wimbledon is related. Since the other party is not a fake, he has no reason to reject the new king messenger, otherwise it is equivalent to being the enemy of the gray castle king. Once the news spread, other people will certainly not hesitate to point the finger at the honeysuckle territory, and the undercurrent that will be suppressed in the city will rebound instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the fact that Tiefko sent only a team of 50 envoys to inquire about the situation also confirmed the saying of the four princes - the new king may not have Work for the land of the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the prince’s princes can repel even more than a thousand dukes of the army, these fifty people may only be able to return without success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this news still needs to inform Lord Roland as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of this, he called the former knight, "Westero, you bring three pony tails, all the way, transfer this as soon as possible The news told the Bianbu town lord. It was said that the people of Tefko were coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following." Westerlo nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the knight turned and left, Peero sighed. "Let's go down to meet the new king messenger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood at the gate of the city and found out that except for the ten people who were in front of the team, they looked energetic and the rest of the knights looked It’s a bit languid, sitting in the back and squatting as if to fall down at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Sir Lehman," Pedro nodded and said, "I am the fortress manager, Pedro Hermon of the honeysuckle family." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word of the fortress manager made him feel a bit sullen. If you are really the boss of the West and the Duke of Fortress, you don’t have to salute the messenger, you don’t even have to greet each other at the door, just stay in the castle of the lord and wait for the other party to ask for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard your name in the Windwind Ridge, "Duke of the Duke"," Lehman rolled over and walked in front of him and smiled. You are really a strange place in the west. The Grand Duke of Ryan’s army has not been able to lay down a small town, but has lost his life. This is rare in the Grey Fort. Of course, this may be good news for honeysuckle. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyro automatically ignored the irony in his words. "Is your subordinates still okay?" They look a little... uncomfortable. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't care about them," Lehman glanced back. "Probably all the way to the road and the soil is not acceptable, just take a break." Honestly, this place is too hot. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too cold in the north," Pei Luo was too lazy to pay attention to this matter since the other party didn't care. "I wonder why the ambassador's messenger is cold." Starting from Fengling, not from Wangdu? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because Tiefko is now in the north," he said bluntly, "Duke of Ace made riots in the north while the strength of the Border Guard was empty." In the case of the alleged rebellion, the king had to send troops to rebel. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebellion? Pedro frowned, which is not in line with the common sense. Although the Border Guard has knights and mercenaries from all over the Grey Fort, most of the members are still Under the command of the Duke himself, how can he initiate a rebellion under the heavy losses of his subordinates? I remember that the Duke of Ryan had intended to take advantage of this opportunity to annex the letters of the North, and he had a bad feeling in his heart... Wimbledon is playing the same idea?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
