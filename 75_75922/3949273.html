			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast fortress coalition slowly walked on the way to Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forefront of the team is the Knights of the six-member fortress. From the armor and dress of the knights, you can see the difference in the strength of the family. Undoubtedly, the most striking is the knights of the Duke of Ryan. The mounts are all from the king's short-tailed horses. They are good at long-distance running and have a larger body than other horses. The knights sitting on horseback are more and more powerful. Their armor is made up of the fortress "Hammer and Dragon Teeth" blacksmith shop. The thick chest of silver shines with a huge lion head and the shoulders are two. Only the wolf head, as if roaring in the mouth. The back cloak is embroidered with delicate patterns, and the waist is also tied with a red ribbon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These knights are not like goods. After the end of the Demon Moon every year, they are responsible for leaving the city to clear the remaining evil beasts and ensure the smooth flow of land. Everyone has accumulated a lot of combat experience. When it comes to single-handed fighting, they are not much worse than the Knights of the Kings, but the number is slightly insufficient. Of course, one hundred and fifty people are drawn by the power of the Duke. The elite knights have been a very amazing expense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Ryan looked at this sharp teacher with satisfaction, no doubt, with their power, no one in the West can stop him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle of the team is the mercenary unit, their equipment is inferior compared to the majority, most people wear some old locks or The film is either missing a hand or a helmet. Some people are only equipped with cheap leather armor, and the weapons are also varied. They were very scattered along the road, and they were together in twos and threes. They laughed and laughed as they walked. It seems that this trip is not for fighting, but for a spring sightseeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the line is the free people who were forced by the lords, who dragged a wheel carrying food and tents slowly. Followed by the mercenary. The difference in speed of travel makes the team of about 1,500 people very long, and the front knights need to stop from time to time, waiting for the people behind to follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult," the Earl of Elk, Hiller Medela, pulled the reins and let himself and the Duke go hand in hand. "We have a small half-day journey from Bianbu Town. It should be able to arrive at the time of the dog (4 pm). When the troops are resting for a night, wait for the next morning to move, or immediately attack the lord castle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Do you still want to sleep in the wild?" The duke laughed. "At night I think we should lie on the big bed of the castle, not the wet mud. Of course, the face of the royal family still has to be considered. After arriving in Bianbu Town, I will first send a messenger to persuade him to surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Honeysuckle walked a little ahead, he turned back, "The Cavaliers After a day, people and horses are exhausted. Wouldn't it be appropriate to attack directly? After all, Roland Wimbledon relied on his miners to survive the entire demonic month. I think we should be careful. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, others don't Chu is nothing, even you don’t know the bottom of the evil beast? My old friend. They are terrible in the wild, they are quick in action, and their strength is amazing. But if there is a wall, most evil beasts are only targets. They are nothing but a group of beasts.” The Earl of Elk shrugged. “I was surprised that he could build a wall so quickly, but with this alone, it is impossible to resist my knights? They are not idiots without brains. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case. And I also received a message from the North," Duke Ryan said carelessly. "This year's Hermes was met." A large number of mixed species of evil beasts attacked, the new holy city almost fell. It is still unclear the reason, but it seems that this year's evil beasts are directed at the holy city, and the west side is just a few fish that slip through the net."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the owner of the West, his eyes are not only concentrated on this remote place, the major cities and towns have eyeliners that have been placed for many years, and they are constantly passed back to the latest places. intelligence. The fierce battle in the Northland is not the focus. In the past few days, he received a secret report from the city of Yasha. The new king Tiefko and the youngster of the clear water, Garcia, fought fierce battles in the Eagle City in the south. According to previous news, the team of Tefko should not arrive in the Eagle City until one month later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no mention of the battle through the letter. It only describes that when Tefko returned from the city of the cliff, thousands of troops were left, and he could not even look like When the road is generally blocked. Others saw that the Eagle City ignited a raging fire, and the black smoke pillars that vacated were almost flush with the clouds, and the residents of the surrounding towns witnessed this wonder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
