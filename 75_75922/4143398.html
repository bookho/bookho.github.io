			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This damn weather," Jean Barthes stood by the window, staring at the overcast sky and whispering, "It’s going to rain again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sinking bay near the sea is not short of rain, especially in the summer and autumn seasons, the first moment of the blue sky, the next wind and rain is also very common, so the city A lot of preparations have been made, from stone pavement to underground drainage facilities. It's not like the Broken Fort or the Greystone City. The next rain will turn the lowlands into leeches, and the mud will be everywhere. One or two heavy rains will delay the unloading of merchant ships, and the impact on the city is almost negligible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not so much the weather, but rather his mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, after the shower, the cloud will dissipate, but the mood will not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, how do you think about answering them?" the clerk Jum asked cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Answer?" The baron sneered twice. "Willed or burned, let you choose one, how would you answer?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." The clerk was dumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't choose it? Continue to drag it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." He opened his mouth and seemed to want to say something more, but he still couldn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even if he doesn’t say it, Jean Bate knows that it’s hard to keep dragging it down – just like the clouds in the sky, no matter what the merchants have How unwilling to see it, it will always fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for everything comes from the war with the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Heart of the Wolf King was destroyed, it seemed that a large number of illegitimate sons of the Wolf King emerged overnight, and the local lords rallied and conquered each other. It is the orthodox trend. After some competition, it gradually formed three major forces: the Token family in the northwest of Panyu, the "Red Stone Gate" family in the south, and the "fang" family in the eastern mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is not too troublesome because of the distance, but the latter two families are different. The two dukes want to sink. Chiwan pulls into its own group and further expands its strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early days of the dispute, the Baron insisted on the neutrality of the harbor and was not guilty of either party. This not only made the city quickly regain its prosperity, but also earned him a lot of income. In order to ensure that the goods can be exchanged for grain or Golden Dragon in time, and the surrounding area is undecided, the two dukes did not force him too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new round of annexation and expansion, the fangs and Redstone Gates gradually emerged as the most powerful contenders for the new Wolf King. Together with the Token family's sudden closure of the main mountain, the two families have once again put their gaze on the sinking pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baron can think of what they are playing with their knees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Swallowing Shenchi Bay, by the way of banned the enemy's material trade, will inevitably gain great advantages in this competition. So this time they not only sent messengers, but also dozens of knights and hundreds of mercenaries, whose attitude is self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seaport has only a patrol that maintains order, and a fraternal group that protects the security of the lord. It is also okay to deal with undressed pirates, facing fully armed The Cavaliers have no self-protection ability. Jean Bate did not intend to resist. If the three forces have already won the game and set the Wolf King, he will not hesitate to pledge allegiance. As for the new wolf king is not from the blood of the old wolf king, he does not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Redstone Gate and the fangs are evenly matched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which side he chooses to stand on, the other side can never sit and watch the loss of sea trade, which means that food, iron and other materials can only rely on self-production, and The other party's energy source is constantly being replenished, which is undoubtedly equal to the victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, once you rely on it, you will definitely be attacked by the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But will the two families really support him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baron did not dare to gamble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is a Redstone Gate or a Duke of Tooth, you can naturally think of it, first use the people of Shenchi Bay to consume the power of the attacker, and then attack the situation Can effectively reduce the casualties of elite knights. Even put the enemy into the city, then block the retreat, and slowly consume it... After all, the other party wants Shenchi Bay, not the people here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, it would be better not to have Shenchi Bay under the jurisdiction of Bate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned before, this is a question of whether to choose to be hanged or burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting two messengers in a camp is to use their mutual hostility to delay time, and it would be better if they could fight. He also provided spirits and women three times and five times, and deliberately let them pick them together. Unfortunately, even if they rushed to face the red, they never looked at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tick, tick..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain finally fell, the garden of the Governor’s Office changed It seems to be covered with a layer of tulle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze of the petals that sway gently in the rain, the baron silently, so waiting for it is not the solution, but he can’t think of continuing to remain neutral. Methods. Grandfather often said that nobles often waver between the gains and losses of interests and powers. As long as they make good use of this, they will be able to control each other. Perhaps he should calm down and give up those little tricks, and think about how to get rid of the difficulties from the strategic level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a rush of footsteps interrupted his meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big, adults, not good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What panic, there is something good Say!" Jean Bate unsatisfiedly stunned the person, "What is wrong in the end?" Is it that the knights finally fight? If that's the case, that's good news! He stared at the guard's mouth, hoping to see the word "camp" or "knight" from the other's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fleet of the Grey Fort and the King of the Grey Fortress occupies the harbour!" However, the words of the guards were completely beyond his imagination, and he was unable to react for a while. "More than that, they also blocked the dock area and prohibited anyone from approaching!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say? Gray... Fort?" The Baron subconsciously repeated "Do they want to buy or sell something? Wait... Did you just say the blockade?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s true!" The guards eagerly said, "They drove away the original." Ships parked on the side of the trestle only allow their own sea-going vessels to dock. They also say that this is a "temporary requisition" and the order will soon recover. The patrol wanted to stop them, but they were disarmed in the blink of an eye! According to reports, there are hundreds of ships in the gray fort outside the port! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let. Bett feels unbelievable. "Are you sure that it is the fleet of the King of the Grey Fort?" Not the home emblem of a certain lord? "Yes, I have seen it with my gazebo," the guards said with a hard time. "It is indeed the flag of the high tower of the Grey House." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god is on the top, is it not the gray castle intended to invade the wolf heart?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why Wenbu Don’t want to leave the rich neighbors and ask him for a detour?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the king of the Grey Fortress wants to expand the territory, there is no need to Attacking at sea? The Token family really can withstand the gray castle army that defeated the church?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this simply doesn’t make sense...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron only felt that his mind was in a mess, and he couldn’t figure out what to do.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the Registrar Going to him, bowed his head and whispered a few words.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baron suddenly brightened his eyes!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Wrong, this may be the opportunity he has been waiting for!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
