It’s good," After a long time, her breathing was calm, and she whispered softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call me Roland," he slowly played with each other's long hair and smiled. "There is no outsider here, I haven't heard you directly." My name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"罗......lan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," he I scratched Anna's ear and made her laugh and sighed. "Actually... this sentence should be correct. Before I put it, I can't imagine a girl who would meet you like this."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there not in the palace?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nowhere," Roland shook his head slightly. "Sometimes I think, I even have a sense of unreality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anna stunned for a moment and put her body closer, "I am here, I won’t go anywhere.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence instantly evokes his memories, and I can’t help but think of her before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you live like a normal person... I don't care, I just want to stay with my Highness, that's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you dreaming? I won't go anywhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Roland followed the silky hair Down, stroking each other's smooth back, "You are by my side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotions are so wonderful, he thought, obviously has no meaning Dialogue, but people feel that the heart is very warm, as if it is about to melt open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the silence was longer, and when he thought the other person had slept, Anna’s voice rang again in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When Wendy told me that the witch is not fertile," Anna whispered. "You will have a lot of trouble later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I don't fear them," Roland replied affirmatively. "In fact, it's nothing compared to the third war of the future." He was still considering using the system to solve the heirs. The problem, but the intelligence brought by Ai Gesha completely broke the expectation. The war that determines the fate of mankind is close at hand. If you can't defeat the devil, all the kingdoms will be completely erased. In contrast, the issue of inheritance is not worth going. care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of this and he paused. "Actually, I was worried about it before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you worried about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid you will refuse me for this reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, Anna did not understand, "I want to be with you, whether it is a witch or not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she heard her answer, Roland couldn’t help but laugh. Yes, since she met Anna, she is such a person... Straightforward, never swaying, any ideas will be revealed to myself. In her body, there will never be a misunderstanding like "I am doing it for you, but I just don't tell you", but I think too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking and chatting, Roland felt his body feel again, and Anna noticed his change, kissed his neck and rolled over and climbed onto him...< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is still very long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Roland got up very late until the sun climbed the top of the castle He only opened his eyes with a yawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
