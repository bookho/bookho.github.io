The prince never thought that the power of the witch came from the devil. He said it was our own. Power - "The nightingale suddenly stopped, she realized that the other party did not believe what she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, she thought, this is not Wendy’s fault. Change to be yourself, I am afraid I will not be cherished by the description of a witch alone. The witches have been oppressed for too long, all the way from the east to the desolate mountains, too many living examples are placed in front of them, being sold out, being abandoned is a common thing, long ago can not believe in others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, her excitement gradually subsided, perhaps this trip will not be as smooth as she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Winter, you know my branching ability, in addition to seeing the flow of magic, you can also tell if others are lying," said the nightingale seriously. I once asked him why he took such a big risk and did this for the witch. He answered me and said, "Bentham Town does not care about birth." He hopes that all witches will become free people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you do this, he will become the pinnacle of the church," Wendy frowned. "Even if the prince doesn't know what it means, you still don't know?" ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night can't help but sneer out, "My first thought was almost like you. I asked him, can these really be done?" As a result, guess how he answered me? She paused and said in a word, "If you don't get out of this step, you will never know the answer.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No lie?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No lie. "The nightingale is sure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds unbelievable," Wendy’s tone loosened slightly. For this long-time friend, she couldn’t think of it. The other party’s reasons for deceiving himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes,” the nightingale has the same feeling. If it’s not seen by the eyes, plus the ability to verify, she’s probably not. I’m going to make up my mind. Now in retrospect, just as Roland said to himself on the wall of the city wall, he really seldom lie. In the past two months, he has not been honestly accountable for his use of ice. Everything else is very satisfying to the nightingale.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, she doesn’t care about that little deception. If she is completely open to a strange witch who has just met her, it’s not long before. Secret, that's weird.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight, after everyone returns, I want to tell the sisters about this important news! She looked at Wendy and said, "I hope you can help me convince everyone." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the evening came, the busy witches began to return to the camp. After seeing the nightingale return safely, everyone was very happy, and asked about Dongwen. West. Seeing the white cloth around their arms, the nightingale felt heavy in his heart, and after answering a few questions, she raised her hand to calm everyone down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Next is a long time to tell, she began to sneak into the border town, to meet Roland, Anna and Nanava, then to build the city wall, assemble the steam engine, and finally to resist the evil beast, and Anna adulthood. The nightingale took out the steam engine design drawings from the arms and proved that he was not lying.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of witches joined the help After the meeting, I lived a life that was isolated from the rest of my life. It was hard to imagine the life of the outside world, and I listened to one by one. When the nightingale said that Anna had not suffered any pain and spent the adult days safely, the crowd suddenly exploded. But the big thing that plagued the witch for a lifetime, she Endure the life of eating food, not wearing cold, and running into the desolate mountains, just to find the legendary holy mountain. If it is really like a nightingale, there is a landlord who is willing to accept them, and at the same time may be protected from the demon. Is the bitterness of the phagosomes more perfect than the holy mountain residence?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a crowd of people is separated, a green head A witch with a half serpentine face walks in front of the nightingale.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear mentor, hello. "The nightingale bowed to her, and the comer was the founder of the Communist Youth League, the snake devil Hakala. In the meeting, the sisters called her a mentor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
