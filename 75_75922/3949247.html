			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry so much, it hasn't come yet." Roland looked at the lightning that he was trying to sigh and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God knows that she is so interested in challenging the evil beast, obviously not the type that is suitable for combat, but there is no ordinary person who faces the fear of the evil beast. "Follow the previous method of dealing with the first one, don't be reluctant, you just seduce the evil beast and focus its attention on you. Be careful to keep the height! Although it can't fly, it is also a threat when jumping up!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know it, I know," lightning is full of confidence. "When I first came over, I found out the details of it. Rest assured, it even connected me." The corners of the clothes are not touched."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a mixture of evil beasts that are already close to the city wall, crossing an obstacle zone and rushing toward the unguarded section. Jump up and turn over the wall. This time, however, no militia members took care of them, they remained in their defensive section, waiting for the next assault command from the Orion Observer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, special warfare against mixed species, now start!" Roland said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning that had already flown out stopped again and looked back at Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say this..." Lightning thought about it, Then I shook my head. "Somewhat strange. Forget it, I set off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the little girl’s fast-moving figure, Roland smiled and asked Anna and the nightingale, "Do you feel weird too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." The two nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay... It seems that the second line of the second is still in the second world even if it is placed in the outside world. "Then go, pay attention to safety."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Highness is also yours," said the nightingale, then pulled Anna's hand and entered the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland hands behind his back, standing in the wind, trying to pretend that the big BOSS should look like. He knows that many people will sneak back on themselves in the battle gasping, so despite the numbness of his feet, he is still standing at the highest point of the city wall, so that everyone can see it - whenever the prince is with them. Since he can't personally fight, he can at least inspire people in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evil beast has exceeded the intensity of any previous attack. According to the iron axe, in the past, the whole demonic moon will only have one or two mixed species, but it is only now. This year, Bianbu Town has encountered four mixed species of evil beasts. The duration is also very long, and the evil beasts continue to emerge from the fascinating forests, continually rushing to the walls with dozens of scales. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the production of guns has increased greatly in the last month. Now that the 100-person guns have been armed, it is impossible to guarantee such an efficient killing speed. If it is a bow, I am afraid that it is hard to wind now. In the protracted war, the advantage of the musket's relatively low physical exertion will become more apparent. Of course, the surge in the consumption of gunpowder is enough to make Roland a headache. He is already considering removing all the more than 20 packs of explosives in the warehouse and getting the gunpowder to be used by the guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, lightning has already flown to the top of the mixed species. She took a stone from her pocket and threw it at the evil beast. The stone fell accurately on the other's head, and this sudden blow made it slammed back, only to find that the attack was from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning provocatively lowering the height, passing in front of it and flying to the center of the town. Although the mixed species of evil beasts have certain thinking ability, the little girl in front of them is obviously judged as not threatening. It immediately swooped up, the wings opened, and several glides glided out nearly a hundred meters. Lightning immediately pulled himself up, turned around in the air, bypassed several bungalows and turned into another street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, she seduce the enemy to the central square of the town, which is the place where she and the nightingale agreed. Because the lion's head and the wings are very sensitive, even the nightingale in the fog will be discovered, so before the nightingale and Anna attack, they must be as close as possible to the attention of the evil beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lightning is perfect, the hybrid is now violently thundering, and the more arrogant animality covers up the little reason, it is wide-mouthed, Jumping into the air several times, but the lightning without any weight on the body is far more flexible than the evil beast. She teased each other up and down, letting her jump back without success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
