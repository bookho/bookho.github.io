			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinforcement? Did he understand what he was talking about? Dunn took a slap in the mouth, even if he came to the reinforcements, it would be useless to go through it! Or is it that the reinforcements he refers to are the main forces that can directly level Hermes and pass over the ruins of the Holy City? In that case, it’s impossible to prepare for the siege in ten days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seeing the other side obviously does not want to continue talking about this topic, Dunn also closed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrance to the side of the cloud ladder is on the mountain wall not far from the cold wind ridge, drilling through an inconspicuous cave, seeing again The moment of the sky is already in the air. When the air is wet, the road will be covered with clouds, and it will travel like a sky, and its name will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as long as the weather is good, this road is still very reliable. In order to discourage the First Army, he deliberately exaggerated the danger level of the ladder in the cloud. In fact, because individual businessmen value its tax avoidance function, the wood and wedges are used to strengthen the collapsed part. The risk of passing people is not high. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent half a day walking back and forth three times with nails and others - walking through the walls of the mountains to avoid the rugged mountain roads and layers of the Holy City The card is set at the same time, and the distance is shortened. Therefore, as long as it is lightly loaded, the efficiency is higher than that of the avenue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don noticed that the nail had been painted with a small book, as if it was recording, except that the above content was in addition to the mainland’s usual text. It is also mixed with many characters he has never seen before. This surprised him. A warrior would read and write without knowing it. He also had knowledge that he could not understand at all. If he didn't see it, he would never believe it. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that in order to learn to calculate and record the entry and exit of goods, he specifically sought a home business association to grasp the basic operation of buying and selling at the price of a golden dragon. If the nail will know the words and break the word, why bother to kill and kill? Although Roland Wimbledon’s army is so powerful that war can always be dead, no one can guarantee that he is not the next one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he found from the conversation between the two that literacy and hand-drawn maps do not seem to be "higher skills", as if everyone in the First Army can do it. This is like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think in these people’s heads? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang En feels incomprehensible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the camp, the sky is near dusk, but the big accounts are full of excitement. The soldiers gathered in a group, excitedly discussing what, and their eyes were concentrated in the campfire in the center of the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the reinforcements are here," the nail opened his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I guess too," Sang Shu smiled. "I don't know which acquaintances will come over this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Lightning and Miss Mai Mai are definitely inside," the squad leader stepped up a bit. "Let's go over it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What, what... Miss? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reinforcements they are waiting for - are women? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don was unable to keep up with the two, finding an open space and looking out to the crowd - and the next moment, he suddenly had the feeling of fainting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, what is this reinforcement! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s clearly a few devils! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially the guy whose hair is dragging to the ground, watching her round cheeks and the big eyes of the water, saying that he is only ten years old and he believes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other few are not so good, the arms and legs are not as big as a punch, and on the battlefield, I am afraid that even the sword can’t move, what can it play? effect? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s ridiculously extreme – what? He suddenly groaned and his mind was uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One reason is that the appearance of these girls is far more than the average woman. One or two did not think, but a group of people stood together and immediately reminded him of the special group of witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
