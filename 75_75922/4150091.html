			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cage Mountain, outside the town of Thorns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A, Auntie--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking into the Treasury, Goode I sneezed. He placed the heavy bullet box in his hand next to the plane and sat up. "I hate winter... It always reminds me of the days of exile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No one likes the evil moon, but I have to say that this temperature is not even on the side of the cold winter." Finkin licked his mouth and opened the wooden box he was carrying. "You should be glad that we are away from the sea." Not far away, the effect of the evil moon is not so obvious - before you become the lord of the Western Front, everyone does not know whether they can live to tomorrow until they fall asleep. Not to mention exile, even if they are hiding in the house, they may be snowed. He was crushed and eventually suffocated in the snow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey...the evil moon without winter is so terrible?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, and this situation will not be completely solved until the undergrowth brings the cement house. Otherwise, why do you think that Roland will name the new king "No Winter City"? Finkin shrugged and took out the drums wrapped in the box and placed them one by one.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Skyfire installed a total of two machine guns, one It is located in the nose of the machine, and it is in the middle of the fuselage. Although it is the latest general-purpose machine gun, the method of feeding is very different. The body of the nose is half buried in the aircraft, and the bullet is used for bombing, so the bullet box It is also made of metal and needs to be disassembled when refilling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machine gun used by the rear seat shooter is fixed on a rotatable gun frame, operating mode It is exactly the same as the Mark One of the Firearms Battalion. The only one is a saddle-shaped drum with a capacity of one hundred shots. After the shot, it can be manually replaced in the air.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in order to ensure that every time the task is full of bombs, no matter how many guns are opened after the plane falls, the ammunition needs to be reorganized. Although this step can be given to the ground staff, Goode prefers Do it yourself - as long as you can touch the plane, even if it is only a moment, he I don't want to miss such an opportunity.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a warm cry outside the storeroom.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Undoubtedly, there must be another student who passed the assessment and landed the plane safely on the runway.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it was snowing, Princess Her Royal Highness There is no suspension training.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even she is more busy than before.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to teaching new students In addition to flying, His Royal Highness will take them to the northwestern part of the wolf to patrol twice a day, and at night he will discuss theoretical classes and problems, and he has not stopped for almost a moment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp By her influence, everyone seems to have a sigh of relief, the training effect is better than in the absence of winter, at least this week, there is no situation in which a trainer has crashed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the partner loading the new magazine into the machine room, Goode went to the window and sighed softly <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp "how, homesick? Finkin followed up and asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head. "I just have some concerns..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Worried about the war or worried about the distant sister? "Finkin showed a smirk. "I remember her name is Rachel, right? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was worried that I was replaced! Goode gave the other person a sigh of relief.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are only four aircraft currently capable of combat, one of which is the unicorn of His Royal Highness, that is, we must be at all qualified The top three in the middle row are qualified to drive the Skyfire. "Goode went back and looked at the lively training ground and whispered. "Our advantage is our actual experience. But now the shadows of the devil are not seen, so if there is one or two talents among the newcomers." We are afraid we will have to lean back. ‚Äù<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
