			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By listening to the seal, Roland received the results of the last sacred duel and everything that happened in the burning place that afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called McCoy, Lightning and Nana Va to the office for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a witch in Tieshacheng who is seriously injured and needs your treatment," Roland looked at the three young girls who stood tall and raised their heads. The little girl and a legal girl said, "Let's prepare for tonight, start tomorrow, don't fly too fast, just rush to the Dragon Ridge before dark, and arrive at Tiesha City the next day, the ashes will be I will meet you there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do we both have to go?" Lightning pointed to himself and McMug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am relieved when you two together," he nodded. "And it’s not alone, but there’s no way to put Nana Tied to your back? Remember to wear more clothes. This kind of weather flight is not a relaxing activity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa looked out the snow drifting out of the window I couldn't help but take a nap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand, be sure to send it on time!" Mai Hao raised his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s okay to fly over..." Lightning grinned. "But if you explore the snowy mountains, you must wait for me to come back and start! If you missed it." I am crying for such a great adventure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, what is the greatest explorer crying... It’s a moment worth recording. Looking at the girl's serious eyes, Roland couldn't help but smile. He knew that there might be a relic in the snowy mountains. After the news spread, lightning has been waiting for a long time. "Of course, you are an indispensable member of the expedition. I can guarantee this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then settled," she assured, patting her chest, "The injured sister will be handed over to us!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can take other sand people to treat them, but don't stay too long," Roland finally told, "Nanawa used up the magic, the day Going back, the route is the same as when you went, do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relocation of the Takula survivors is now nearing completion, and the snow mountain exploration tour is about to begin, but Na If Nava is not without the winter city, he really dare not let many witches rush to the unknown land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people answered in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they left, he grew a sigh of relief in his chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a successful way to lead the extreme south?" The nightingale came out from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can only say that you have taken the first step," Roland smiled. "There are a lot of things to do later."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, after more than a month of fighting, the desert action finally came to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next migration is the highlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spread the map of the corner of the mahogany long table, and set his sights on the southern part of the gray fortification - giving the surrender of the Shamin to the new oasis as early as before the departure Already accounted for the iron axe, and the preferred location is the land of the border of the lord and a large population. After the continuous civil war between Tefco and Garcia, major cities such as Bishuigang and Xiongying City were turned into ruins, and many surrounding towns and farmlands were destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the steady flow of refugees into the winter city, there is an increasing amount of abandoned land in the south. Instead of staying there and letting it grow grass, it is better to let the sand people enter the southern border to open up, along the junction of the desert and the green space, and rebuild the clear water port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, workers who extract black water can start from the clear water port and take the sea to the southern end of the desert. According to the report of the iron axe, most underground rivers They are all located south of the Burning Land, and the endless Cape is the most common. There, there is a tributary of black water that is close to the surface and close to the coast. Compared with dangerous land routes, it is obviously much safer to sail along the coast. For the current technical strength of No Winter City, it is undoubtedly the most suitable collection place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
