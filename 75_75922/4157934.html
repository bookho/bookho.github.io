Roland’s mind calculated the rising speed observed by lightning and found that the result was completely beyond the scope of the "weapon". "Wait, Are you going to razed the entire fertile plains?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is enough to make the god of God become a natural disaster, don't say it The entire plain will be destroyed, and I am afraid that the light and blackrock fields will be seriously affected. The floating land with a diameter of tens of kilometers descends from the height of tens of thousands of meters, and the shock wave is enough to surround the planet. The dramatic changes in the landscape will cause earthquakes and tsunamis. In the face of such a disaster, even the devil can’t escape. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fertile plains were turned into basins, the seawater was poured, and the life of the light was extinct. Where can they go? As the seas are pressing harder today, the original plan of the devil is to seize the human domain to delay the time, which has formed a fundamental conflict with their strategic goals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod slightly looked at him unexpectedly. "You can clearly understand the effect of the second program... so it can save I have a lot of effort. Of course, God of God will not rise all the time. It will turn to hovering in about two days, and then move to the east of the Grey Fort. If the mask is not lying when making plans, it will eventually It will land on the sea - this will destroy your kingdom and preserve the next two stone veins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's really fine Program. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is calm on the surface, but his heart is dignified to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he learned that the two monarchs appeared together, he realized that something must have happened, so that he could not wait for this time to receive the letter. This is why he risked returning to the slopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I didn’t expect the news to be so bad! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Heckzod and Cerroshhi are willing to cooperate, it is not difficult to destroy the core of God-made God. The problem is that the detonation device of nuclear weapons is not a factory. In the case of mass production of mass production, it takes several weeks to assemble and fit even if the raw materials are abundant. The principle bomb that was detonated in the morning sun was the product of the Ministry of Industry, and the new combat warhead was still in the manufacture of the Winter High Energy Test Institute. Even if it was to work, it would not be possible to get the morning sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one step, even if he did not experiment in the morning, it would take at least one day to bring the detonating device to God and install it. It has been able to let the floating continents accumulate the potential to destroy most of the morning kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you do this in the first place? If you only need to spend a stone to beat humans, you shouldn't wait until today."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think is the god of God, the cabbage in the farmer's field?" Heikzod did not have a good air. "Do not mention the combination of the magic core and the birth tower." The difficulty is that the large-scale Shenshi vein is rare enough. It only rises for two days because the stone will wither after two days--in terms of the reserves of Hermes's veins, even the implementation of the second program. There are no qualifications."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a reason for limited magic consumption...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mask can control it, and the others should be able to." Roland’s thoughts turned sharply. "Don't you have tried this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Human beings, you are wasting your time!" Hecksod’s tone is obviously impatient, "even the creators of core instruments." The bottom civilization has not been able to popularize such complicated things. Although my family has accepted the inheritance, it does not mean that everyone has such talents, let alone those who have not accepted the inheritance! Time, hurry to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't go anywhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You- —!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland picked up the drink and blocked the wrath of the Scorpio Lord. After he took a sip, he solemnly said, "There are millions of people in the gray fort and the morning sun. It is too short to move them to the fjord. And without the winter city, human beings cannot stop the sea and sea from the sea." Enemy, I have a meaning to live alone, but it is the difference between morning and evening." He paused, "and don't forget - as long as the battle of divineity is not stopped, and finally you can't escape the end of the ruin, this is you What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
