			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the full flame of the Three Princesses, the Ashes took the initiative to launch an attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia did not retreat, lifted his body and rushed toward his opponent, but this time she found that her pursuit could not be coherent, with a wide range of sweeps. It is difficult to force the other party to return to the block, as if she has been slowing down at all times, and the attack that can be seen before the ashes can only tear off a floating dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And more often, nothing can be touched. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment of fighting, the wolf woman had to re-apply, and after the right-handed paw was unsuccessful, she used the spare force to sway and slap the thick tail to each other. - This kind of trick allows her to instantly include half of the high platform in the attack range. Even if the footsteps are fast, it is impossible to retreat completely, unless the other party does not intend to be close at first. The tail like an iron whip can easily scrape the flesh and blood, and most of the wounds on the ashes are left behind by this trick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the impact of the impact did not come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an exclamation on the watchtower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia’s heart suddenly raised a bad premonition, at the same time, her eyes caught a figure falling from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She--flying up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the onlookers widened their eyes and saw the ashes jump in place, and they crossed the wolf woman who was half a head taller than her. The position is exactly the head that the other side turned back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tail attack range is large, and it can only be smothered, and there is no threat to the target in midair. However, it is very difficult for most people to skip such a high distance. It is easy for the opponent to judge the drop point after the body is off the ground, so that the next attack is inevitable, so few people will take off in the duel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, after the wolf woman swung her body, the tail part became her blind spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash didn’t choose to be merciful, but a punch into Luo Jia’s eyes. The big eyes of the bowl suddenly shattered, and a group of blood splashed her. Half-length, severe and unbearable pain also caused the latter to make a hoarse scream - even if the body is resistant, the organ such as the eye is still a fragile part. After losing one eye, the balance of the duel has quickly turned to the superb side. Tilted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when the ashes planned to pull back and give the other party a chance to surrender, they found that Luo Jia had to close his eyes, and the upper and lower eyes were even with his face. The muscles of the department gripped her right hand tightly. At the same time, a giant claw fanned towards her - no doubt, even if this claw was photographed, it would aggravate the wounds of the wolf female eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party unmistakably revealed his will to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is normal, this level of imprisonment obviously cannot trap the extraordinary witch, and at most her movements are slightly slower, but at such a critical moment, even at such a critical moment. The moment of rest is extremely deadly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash knows that he can’t escape, he does not hesitate to lift the other arm and succumbs to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge impact force made her feel as if she had broken her bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A breath of blood spit out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the first time she was actually hit after the duel began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two separated, the ashes noticed that their left arm had been folded into a strange shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“吼————!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia screamed and opened his mouth to bite at her Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash does not advance and retreat, roll forward, escape the other party's bite and drill into the dead corner below the wolf's neck, and then support the ground with one hand. Both feet kicked to each other's forelimbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
