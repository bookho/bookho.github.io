			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the winter, the center of the square in Bianbu Town has set up a wooden platform for the first time, but this time it is not for theatrical performance, but for the town. The first public trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notice was issued two days ago. On the day of the trial, the wooden platform was crowded with the people. The square after the expansion was much larger. Still can't accommodate so many people. There are sporadic snowflakes in the sky, but everyone is so high that they ignore this snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Roland came on stage, the atmosphere suddenly reached a climax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the people who waved his arms to the audience, and couldn’t help but feel that when he was involved in Anna’s decision here a year ago, he was almost a nobleman. In the eyes of the laughing stock, the influence on the people is closer to zero. In just one year, the situation has become completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bursts of voices, Campas’s priests were also pressed up, and in the face of the dense crowd, he looked a little changed – probably this array It’s not uncommon to see the high-level church members. They have long been accustomed to the worship of believers. They can influence the life of the believers in words and deeds. Roland thinks that this time, he may not be able to experience the glory of the past. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step on the wooden platform is the federation witch, whose eyes have unstoppable excitement - often filthy, hunted and unjust For the trial, the role they played this time was completely reversed. The witch is the victim, the accuser, and the jury, and the object of the trial is replaced by the church. They did not imagine such a scenario, but did not expect that day to come so fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pressed down and pressed, and people suddenly quieted down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My people, hello."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To bring everyone together today, It is to show you a shameless crime. The church concealed the truth from the beginning. If you did not find the priest from the Holy City in a joint case, I could not know such amazing news." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was reconsidering two days ago, how to preach the crimes of the church is more effective - the fall of the Longling rebellion obviously can not be the focus, the people will not I care about what happens in a distant small city; the war of gods and the kingdom of witches cannot be mentioned, because things are too embarrassing hundreds of years ago, and revealing the existence of the devil is also likely to cause panic. If you want to arouse the indignation of the masses, you have to start from the things that are of concern to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, it must be grounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the closest thing to their daily lives is the witch who lives here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church declares the witch as the devil's minions, unclean and unclear, but in fact, both the pope and the archbishop, they are raising witches, And the scale is amazing! This is what the official said," Roland turned to look at each other. "I didn't say anything wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." After a long silence, Campas answered, "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd suddenly sounded a discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, is he really a priest in the Holy City?" someone asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Roland cast a praised look at Echo, "and he was sent to the Grey Fort in the name of the Church Messenger. Prove his identity!" He pointed to the small table next to the wooden platform. "God robes, micro-chapters, and notices can be used as evidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This It is also the most likely question for the onlookers. Instead of letting them ponder afterwards, it is better to let the echoes come up first, and then answer them by themselves - not to mention that these things are genuine and not necessary for him to forge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Back to what I said before, my people," the prince continued, "pay attention to the words I use - support! Yes. They sent the baby girls and female orphans collected throughout the kingdom to the Holy City Monastery, where the women were fed like animals. Given the odds of witches, only a small number of people could become witches, and then further Training, and those who fail to become witches have become playthings of church believers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
