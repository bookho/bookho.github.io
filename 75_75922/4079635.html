			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, the whole "skin" is also curled up, a reptile drills a stone wall, dragging the skin with constant mucus and quickly to the top of the cave Climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the action of the nightingale is faster than it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She emerged from the fog, hanging upside down on the top of the cave, standing in front of the reptile - when the figure has not yet fallen, a flash The silver dagger has pierced its head and put it on the stone wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the worm struggled for a moment, the six slender feet fell down and there was no more life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the lightning noticed that the so-called "egg" was just the tortoise's torso, except that its head and feet were buried in the stone, and even Covered by a huge abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of this bug is completely disproportionate. The first half is somewhat like an enlarged ant, but only half a meter in length; but the latter half is mad. The "skin" part of the magic wrap can almost fill the three big barrels. Even if the mucus has been spilled more than half, the whole stomach is smashed, but the area that is spread is still amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The devil is produced from the belly of this thing?" the little girl asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never heard of similar things," Aegusa squatted down and looked at the devil with the help of the magic stone. "This madman ...is already a fully mature individual. Look at its arm, not only the scars inlaid with the magic stone, but also the thickness of the other one, which means that it has used the magic to throw the spear more than once." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about magic stone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, probably who took it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So is this bug done?" Elena was slightly impatient. "It swallowed the devil into the belly and hung it." Digesting food on the wall, and then accidentally met us - the magic stone was lost in the battle, or was directly digested, can it make sense? Don't care about this disgusting bug, it is important to find Fulan. What happened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swallowing in the belly? Lightning heart bottom abdomen, its mouth is swallowed by an adult, not to mention the height of nearly three meters, the burly madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Somewhat strange..." The voice of the nightingale suddenly came from the sky. "It is clearly dead, why is the magic now dissipating?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Ai Gesha said, "You mean this devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes It's magical, it's like a fog, I noticed it when I got out of the worm's belly. But it really didn't have life at the time - at least one or two days from the degree of skin rot. "The nightingale wonders, "Is it impossible for magic to gather on the dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are not mistaken, it is really strange..." Yi nodded and forced the sword in his hand into the stone wall. "Maybe we should take the two bodies back and study it. Let's leave a mark, wait until the camp is back and pick them up."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the pedestrian did not go far, and found several "eggs" one after another, they are not all buried On the wall, some directly standing on the river bank, or a pair of mushrooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time everyone has experience, every hit is on top of the key, and the insects buried in the soil are squatted. Cut the belly of the insect, in addition to the madman, but also found the heart of fear and human body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the faces of the witches very bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no human settlements outside the border area. How do they capture these prey? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, under the ignorance of God, the enemy has already reached the tentacles into the territory without the winter city? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the nightingale suddenly issued a warning, "There is a magic reaction in front! Wait, no... that is, Fran?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
