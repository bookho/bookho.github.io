			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland subconsciously remembered the description of the magic of the nightingale, but in his opinion, this rotating cyclone is more like a galaxy - the brightest star in the middle There are several spiral arms that rotate around the star nucleus. Although it is only the size of the palm, it looks like it can feel the endless details and power of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the martial arts family?" The other party suddenly opened his mouth, his mouth was one by one, his voice was hoarse like a scorpion leaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have mistaken people." Roland's alertness mentioned the highest point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also," the body of the Jiaozuo man also turned over, and his head did not move. "Your taste is sweeter."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are a woman, I might be a bit interested in these words." He looked at the place where the other person might become a weakness. "You are being magical... No, "People who are countered by the power of nature?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of nature?" The man with a squeaky squeak from the almost ruined nose, "They are fundamentally I don't understand where this power comes from, and I don't know anything about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you know the same." Hell, this is still him. Dream? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't say it, but I can feel it - it doesn't belong to the world, it's a gift from the gods," the other side is full of blood bubbles. "I thought the robbery incident could attract one or two martial artists. I didn't expect the guy to surrender too quickly. Fortunately, it was not in vain. It was also brought to you -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔嚓! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for the focal face man to finish, Roland has already started. The so-called first to be strong, and then start to suffer, regardless of the tone of the other party or give him the feeling, is a dangerous molecule, waiting for the enemy to finish playing is not a wise move, according to childhood experience, the first to win the most important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved a straight punch on the other’s head, and the speed was like a lightning bolt – considering that the strength has grown tremendously now, this punch is not With all his strength, even so, he can feel the touch of the cheek bone bursting under the fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focal face man was directly beaten out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heat in the body boils, as if to cheer for this blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man rolled two turns after landing, hit the wall and stopped, waiting to climb hard, Roland did not hesitate to pursue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the world of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opponent is not a human being - at least not an ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No ordinary person can continue fighting in the case of broken cheekbones. He neither complains nor asks for mercy. From this point, he is equal to kicking himself. Out of the human sphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland feels that his consciousness is sober. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbulent heat flow, though full of body, did not give him any feeling of being overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second move after the first one is to beat the dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he is not keeping his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no skill, just like beating sandbags. The face-faced man obviously didn't expect this situation and could only be tired. However, as Roland's strength improved, the defense quickly lost its effect. The hands used for the block were broken into several pieces, and the sternum and ribs were all crushed. Every punch was like playing on the tofu. The hard muscles of the other side gradually became a muddy mud. Can't live anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let you install, let you install!" Roland groaned as he groaned. "Can you turn your head very much? You think you are taking a ghost film!" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...no...probably..." The voice of the other party has completely changed, and it is almost impossible to hear what is being said. "Why am I... I can't use it..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the use?" Roland noticed that the gas rotation speed on his forehead was getting slower and slower, trying to reach out and discovering that it had become an entity at the moment. "Do you use this magic?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, don't touch it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy said that it is natural to do, He held the other's head with one hand and pulled the cyclone with one hand. When the heat flowed to the top of the body, the cyclone was pulled down by him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male face is silent and silent, as if he has lost all the vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After falling into Roland’s palm, the cyclone turned from deep red to brilliant white in the inner white and blue, so it looked more like a galaxy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it didn’t stay in the hand for a long time. After regaining the rotation, the cyclone shot a dazzling brilliance and went straight into the sky, as if left between the heavens and the earth. A silver wire disappeared after a few seconds. At this time, Roland noticed that the warmth in the body also calmed down, and it seemed to have been greatly satisfied, so that there was a saying in the whole body. Out of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is completely confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This world may be much deeper than he imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgetting a look at the ground-faced man who was no different from the dead, Roland smoked his mouth and turned away from the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the gables like the gables standing on the side of the long street, the sky has already darkened, the lights in the corridors have attracted a group of flying insects, making annoying embarrassment Humming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He figured out the key, inserted it into the keyhole by dim light, and had not had time to twist it, and there was a rush of footsteps at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was opened, and the cleansing was close to the brow, and there was still a trace of anxiety in the dissatisfied eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where have you been?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where have you been?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two asked almost at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The tuition class is temporarily added, because there is a teacher to check tomorrow, the school is on holiday for a day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I am going to find you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for me?" Little girl will be suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, who told you not to come back on time," Roland laughed, and he licked the other's head and walked into the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three dishes and one soup on the table, but the tableware is still clean, obviously Jielu has been waiting for him to come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she will run for the first time when she hears the lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dinner," Roland sat at the table. "I am starving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Don't you worry that I was cheated by a stranger?" She blinked. "I am not a child anymore. I will wait for me to come back next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Roland can't help but turn a blind eye, now junior high school students have become so sensible? I remember that at this age, it was crazy than a dog. When there was change, I ran the game hall. If I didn’t have any change, I went to the mountain to catch the chafer. I didn’t go home until dark, and it was a gap between heaven and earth. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An inexplicable confession comes to mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, are you going to have a holiday tomorrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm," It seems a bit angry, but the look has been alleviated a lot. "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
