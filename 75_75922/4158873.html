			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North of the Fertile Plain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the day of leaving the Winter City, lightning and wheat have been flying almost for nearly ten days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They patrol the plains at a speed of 100 kilometers, which is also the "economic speed" of the flight, and the magic of recovery at night can fully support the day. Only when camping or hunting is required will the two land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expedition has now entered a region that has never been involved in the past, and although it holds the map of the Federation era, the changes of hundreds of years are enough to make the road ruined. The canal is dry, and most of the towns are engulfed by weeds and shrubs, which can no longer serve as a signpost. Only the stars in the sky and the mainland spine in the distance can guide them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this distance, listening to the seal has long been impossible to subpoena, and there seems to be only one person and one bird on the vast land. This kind of smallness and loneliness is a major obstacle to adventure. Without the companionship of a partner, lightning does not know whether one can persist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of their trip is very clear, that is to determine the location and route of the devil's new god, and by the way, "light up" outside of Takira Plain wasteland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, it is not an easy task to find floating land on such a vast land. In order to reduce the loss of the veins, the enemy's king city will not fly too high, and may even fly to the ground. In this way, the god of God made from a distance is not much different from a small hill. If you get close to 100 kilometers, you can confirm the target according to the red fog. This must also be in good weather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in order to avoid passing the god of God, Lightning chose a polygonal flight path, and the edge of this line is the continental spine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕噜..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the gray eagle’s belly made a muffled sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you hungry?" Lightning slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗷." Mai Hao nodded again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's clear that you haven't moved, why are you hungry faster than me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Because I have been staring at the ground!" She leaned over the cheeks of lightning. "The eyes are connected to the brain, and the book says that the people who use the brain are the hardest!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc., in the "Natural Science" is not written like this at all... That paragraph is to say that even if it is not moving, the brain is also the organ with the highest energy consumption, this is not The person who represents the movement does not need to use his brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the itching on the cheeks made it impossible for the lightning to fly. She had to drop the speed and fall to the ground. From the sky, they can fly for up to half an hour, and it is not a big problem to take a break early. What's more, there is not much left in the bag. It is also a good choice to use this time to replenish the grain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the most important thing is that she really can’t help but refuse to sell the wheat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So old rules, you go hunting, I come to make a fire, any situation is the first time to use the listener to print contact, understand?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Completely understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has not fallen, Mai Hao has vacated and turned into a The beast flies to the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning helplessly find a shelter and start preparing for dinner. With Roland's technical support, risk-taking essentials such as flint, velvet and torches have been replaced by smaller and more sophisticated industrial products, such as a half-slap-sized windproof match, a flashlight with a disposable dry battery, and a large number of Parts, a multi-function knife that every explorer can't put down...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things can all be put in a pocket, because of this, she will be in her backpack More than half of the space has been replaced with a wide variety of spices, and as long as there is plenty of time, it is possible to make a table of dishes that are not repeated. Sometimes lightning is not clear to her. She is more adept at taking risks, or is more talented for food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
