			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, I will come back again in the evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu’s eyes stunned at two People always feel that they have made a mistake. He is the ash ambassador! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Otto left, he had not had time to ask questions. Hill blocked all his dissatisfaction in one sentence. "This is what Mr. hopes." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the support, "Are you sure? I represent the gray castle. If the Lord of the Morning knows about it, the relationship between the two countries will return." What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say that Ampein. Moya has no time to pay attention to such a small matter, even if he is now, the witch is more than a covenant. More important,” Hill said solemnly. “In fact, when I was picking slaves, my people were already secretly concerned about whether there were witches in the refugee group.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"What is the result?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing," he shook his head. "Either there are no witches in the refugees, or they are well hidden. Completely integrated into the locals. In short, if you can bring back a witch to your majesty, he will definitely reward you - you know how much attention Roland has attached. They."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the request of an old friend, Joel’s face promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forget it, just go to open your eyes. He comforts himself in his heart. Even Denise is not qualified to go. He is also very curious to sell it. What are the slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, Otto appeared on the doorstep of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe followed him to board a luxury carriage without an emblem, which was actually suspended from the roof of the car, except for the thick fluffy carpet. The chain of chains, at a glance, knows what it is used for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think you have this hobby," Joel whistled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough...this is not my car," Otto’s face was slightly red. "If you want to cover your eyes and ears, you can hold each other, only this." It is more suitable for a carriage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to explain, I understand." He curiously touched the wrist button under the chain, "wait for this. After all, can the car borrow me for a few days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the rent of 50 silver wolves a day, together with the driver," Otto After telling the driver to the destination, I found a comfortable position and lay down. "The distance is a bit far, you can take a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About half an hour, on the outskirts of Huiguang City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is not today Can't you come back?" Joel was surprised. "When the sun is completely down, will the gate be closed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Black money" supplies shelter and food, In fact, you are in the Glow City Able to buy services, there are available. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds just like the market. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost, the only difference is that it is built underground. Otto said, "I have only been there once. I don't know if the bidding steps have changed, but as long as the guides say it, there should be no problem." After taking the witch, you don't have to wait until the end of the whole show, go directly to the backstage, and then there will be a waiter to arrange the room for you-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait... ..." looked at him strangely. "Don't you go in with me?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only one invitation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the money?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This black letter is money," Otto smiled. "With it, it is equivalent to the approval of the Chamber of Commerce. You only need to quote." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course there are... only far higher than the price of the witch. According to the information I collected, the price of the witch that was shot a few years ago is around a thousand dollars. Now Ampere’s order to clear the witch, the transaction price should be even more Lower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thousand gold dragons! Joel is secretly screaming, and this group of upper-class nobles are too much to take money seriously. You must know that even if you play all the famous Fengyue places, you can't spend so much money! Is it that the level is too low, and have never touched the really expensive gameplay? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Additionally... In order to gain her trust, you better not touch her," Otto coughed twice. "After all, she is not a real slave, or she ships. There may be trouble on the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I certainly understand this," he sighed, but he was the one who wanted to kill him. Dare to touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, remember to wear a hood when she comes out, we will meet again tomorrow morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the carriage drove out of the city gate, it ran westward until the faint yellow glow was completely swallowed by the night, and the driving speed slowed down. Similar to Otto's estimate, after half an hour, the two arrived at their destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exhibition venue at first sight is no different from ordinary dwellings. The slanting fence encloses an empty yard with a mud and straw piled up in the middle. In the earth house, behind the yard is a bare farmland – the wheat has been harvested, leaving only a cluster of bundled straw, like the dragonfly growing in the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only striking thing is that there are a lot of shaking torches in the farmland, and obviously someone is guarding nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, there will be no checkpoints in front of the courtyard of the general residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After checking the invitation, Otto and the accompanying guards all stayed outside the yard. Joel followed the guides into the earthen house and followed the wooden ladder in the center of the hall. All the way down, through a narrow tunnel that was manually excavated, he walked into a natural cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cave is almost half the size of the Wangdu Square. With the swaying torches, he can still see many dark holes on both sides. Where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floor at the bottom of the hole has been re-polished and paved with flat tiles. Only the stalactites hanging from the top of the head can see the original appearance of the place. A lot of people have gathered here and seem to be waiting for the start of the show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu’s finally knows what it means to be “not so formal” in Otto’s mouth. From this scene, it’s really not much different from the mouse meeting. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, please here." The guide took him to the seat marked on the black letter and sat down beside him. "This exhibition I am at your service for the whole process. If you have any doubts about the goods, you can ask me." During the conversation, the other party put the soft chest on the arm of Joel. Under the dim light, he can see her under the mask. Sharp chin and rosy lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this also a kind of service?" He stretched his elbow unceremoniously. "What is your name?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, adults, you can call me on the 76th," the other party breathed like a blue, but the answer was not messy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, he retracted the foreword, and the mouse absolutely couldn’t train such a waiter. If every bidder has a guide, it is enough to be amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But is it always so dark here?" Joel enjoyed the soft touch from his arm and asked an eyebrow. "This way I can’t see the stage." "Commodity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will know soon," she chuckled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As proof of the words on the seventy-sixth, the sound of metal friction suddenly sounded at the top of the cave, and then several chains fell down, each wire end They all hung a strange stone, and their light was even brighter than the torch. In an instant, the booth in front of it was clearly seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation in the cave suddenly subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
