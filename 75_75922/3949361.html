			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland drank a cup of tea and said, "In addition, I plan to carry out basic education at the Long Song Fortress. This is also how you can continue to host the Long Song Fortress. Assessment project."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the word assessment, Pei’s ear immediately erected, “Basic education?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," he nodded with a smile. Now that the church has been destroyed, the high priest has been killed, and the power of the church in this place has been weakened. It is a good time to compete for ideas. He does not expect to transform all believers into potential qualified workers, as long as the influence of the church is further eliminated. If the Holy City wants to catch the long song fortress again, Roland has many ways to keep them out, and I don’t even think about building a new church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Basic education for all residents under the age of 40, regardless of gender, content includes reading and writing of words, simple calculations, popularization of natural knowledge and ideological education. Roland waved his hand and pressed the other party's question. "Reassure, this fee will be deducted from the tax paid to Bianbu Town. From this month, you only need to pay 20% of the tax, and the remaining 10% will be used as The use of special education fees - you can recruit a few scholars from Wang Du, or hire local knights to succumb to the aristocrats, but these people can not spend much money. 10% of the tax has at least a thousand gold dragons, so you have to do Far more than that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer thought for a moment and said: "Your Highness, do you mean to use this money to motivate residents to receive education?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy’s reaction is really sharp, Roland laughs. “Yes, except for children, most people have a life to do during the day, so their education. It should be launched at night. It’s busy all day, no. When it's easy to rest, no one wants to listen to others, let alone learn literacy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you can use Some means to entice them to learn, such as offering a dinner with meat, such as fast progress, you can get monetary rewards, etc. Of course, bright and spacious classrooms are also essential." He paused, "In short, you must I want to do everything I can to spread this work to all the residents of the fortress. As I said, this is also an assessment of you: one year later, I asked for more than 50% of the literacy of the fortress."<br /><br />&nbsp "And nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Your Highness..." Pei Luo hesitated and said, "No matter scholars or nobles, they have no experience in literacy, let alone the popularization of natural knowledge and ideological education." Out of the few nouns, "In fact, I don't even understand myself. With these people, I am afraid I can't achieve the effect you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I have also considered this," Roland said. “Don’t worry, I will send a group of officials from the City Hall to assist you in this matter, and the books needed for education are all provided by Bianbu Town. They are experienced and can train the personnel you recruit first, then to the residents. Carry out education. When you talk to them in detail, you will understand that the specific matters can be handled by them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, as long as he still wants to continue to take charge of the fortress This will inevitably enable this group of people, the prince thinks, and through the Ministry of Education officials to insert cronies, the news of the long song fortress can also be passed back to Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Pero did not express an objection, Roland began to explain the last order: "The third thing, I plan to build between the Long Song Fortress and Bianbu Town. A road to shorten the time between pedestrians and caravans to and from the two places."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, there is already a road between the two places?" Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mud path that is stepped on by people can also count? Less than two meters wide, the rain is full of mud, and the road is full of potholes, not suitable for high-speed carriages. Roland shook his head. "The road I want to build can accommodate at least two carriages side by side. The road is flat and straight, and there is no water accumulation when it rains, just like the streets of Bianbu Town."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean gravel road?" The acting city owner looked a little surprised. "The cost of this road is not low. It needs to be excavated by stonemasons to select the right size stone." It can only be used together. It takes at least 5,000 gold dragons to build a gravel road from the fortress to Bianbu Town. Your Highness, I am blunt, if the song is not taxed, I am afraid I can’t get so much money. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fortress can only be used to provide manpower." The prince bluntly said, "You post recruitment notices to various Western Territories, not just long song fortresses, but also The major family territory, the salary is six silver wolves per month, the construction period is one year, I believe that there should be many people applying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
