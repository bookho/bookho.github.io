			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa sees it more clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original carrier does not depend on the eyes. For her and Elsie and Celine, any tentacles can be used as an eye, so they can’t be worn. Any shade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Roland reminded that it is best to avoid direct vision within five to ten seconds after the detonation, it did not turn its attention until the last second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only her, but also the other two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody wants to miss this long-awaited scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can humans defeat the devil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Takila survivors have been hiding in the ground for hundreds of years, no one dared to ask this question. At that time, their teeth insisted on more responsibility, and in order to sacrifice the sisters, as for the final result, I would like to think about the feeling of resistance in my heart, for fear of destroying my unremitting efforts and willingness to fight. The darkest caves that you see on your head every day are the most profound feelings in their memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this darkness was broken by a sly blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not pure blue, it’s different from paint, paint, gems, or lake water. It’s hard to describe Pasha specifically – it’s more It seems to be too white to produce a "blue illusion". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light spreads rapidly along the horizon and illuminates the earth in an instant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but stunned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time she has seen that things other than the sun and the moon can make the whole earth shine - that is not an illusion, she is clear The ground sees the original dark snowfield returning to the white scorpion. A tree casts a heavy tree shadow on the snow. The closer to the center of the white light, the clearer the outline of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, Pasha felt a sharp tingling in front of her, the skin seemed to be burned, and that was exposed to the midday sun. Experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she didn’t feel the slightest fear in her heart, and even opened her body to meet the dark light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it can bring new hope to humanity, what is the pain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only for more fun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light only lasted for less than a second, then turned from blue to white, then white to red, then the ground trembled fiercely, and the airflow from the face The snow flakes hit the outer wall of the bunker building and made a loud noise. The last is a deafening roar, which lasts for a long time, as if the whole earth is roaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world regained its silence after the explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange cloud appears on the horizon in the distance. It is large and small, like a mushroom that stretches upwards. The top of the mushroom still sees a dark red flame rolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighting the sky with one's own strength, this is definitely an effect that no firearm can match! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fifteen kilometers, you can feel this power, what if you are close at hand? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa has been able to imagine the new weapon when it exploded in the devil group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought that the bombardment of hundreds of artillery pieces was already the most shocking picture, but compared to this scene, it seems to be worthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the gunfire exercise two years ago refreshed the worldview of each Takira witch, then the test can be said to make it difficult to shape in their minds. The concept has been reshaped again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哗"——————————!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The masters of the three high-level witches are also entwined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this really what we can make?" Rarely, Elsie did not use servants or ordinary people to distinguish each other for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course! I am responsible for processing a part of the shell." Celine's tone was full of excitement, "but to be honest, I didn't think it was really true." What is said by his Majesty--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...because of leadership I always like to draw cakes to entice everyone to move forward. At that time, did the three seats encourage us so much... Wait, I am not saying that this is wrong, don’t tell Roland!”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay," Pasha interrupted. "What do you think is the result of the battle of God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Can win, definitely win!” Serin replied without thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And maybe you don't have to drag on to the next red moon." Aer's also expressed his approval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a year ago, the standard of victory still resisted the devil's offense, insisted on the end of the war of divineity, and found opportunities after four hundred years of development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, this standard has improved a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough..." Pasha finally laughed. "We all thought of a piece."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Humans can defeat the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and maybe it’s more likely than they expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that darkness is gone, it no longer exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the jubilant people, only Roland and Anna remain normal Calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the result?" Anna asked as she took off her sunglasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least the first step is to cross the past." Roland's handcuffs, the principle device triggered is undoubtedly fission reaction, the dazzling flash is proof, Otherwise, it is impossible to pick up such a big wave by relying on thousands of kilograms of explosives in the device alone. However, from the point of view of the subsequent shock wave and the smoke column, it is clear that there is a big gap between his expected effects - they should be more violent. "As for the specific results, it is necessary to wait for the command post to collect all the on-site data to make a judgment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the test teams continued Bring back the "detection device" set around the field - floating paper. Since there is no technical means available in Winter City, it is impossible to accurately determine the equivalent of explosives. Therefore, Roland naturally thinks of the method of "measuring power with paper." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the air waves blow to this place, these pieces of paper will be thrown up by the wind, and by the impact of the blast, they will fall farther than before. Some, and through the difference, can estimate the approximate equivalent of the explosion - Roland does not need to calculate by himself, he has copied from the dream world to a complete parameter list, just compare the statistical results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are certain errors in this method, it is sufficient to guide the test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comparison after the comparison is expected to be similar to the expected one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of this principle device explosion is only about 3,000 tons of TNT equivalent, while the input of uranium 235 is as much as forty kilograms. If only the first atomic bomb used in the actual atomic bomb "Little Boy" participates in the fission reaction and the explosive equivalent is 13,000 tons of TNT, then the nuclear material utilization rate of this test is not even 2%. It can be said that it is a "dirty bomb". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it’s hard to say how much Roland’s mood is disappointing. After all, there is no such thing as a strict standard of dirty bombs in the history of weapons. Compared with the small-scale nuclear weapons that have been used up to a large number of dozens, these old-fashioned predecessors have all been classified as dirty bombs. A 152mm grenade with only a few kilograms of charge can cause amazing damage, not to mention the 3,000-ton TNT. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
