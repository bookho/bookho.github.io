			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, Roland got a positive answer from the eldest son of honeysuckle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am willing to continue to work for you, the honeysuckle family will be like this." He snarled, "I will convince my father, he and a few others... ...not much the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Roland felt happy, "so best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;" These days, I have witnessed the amazing changes in your territory... Probably, this is the city I expect," Pelos said bluntly. "If you can make honeysuckle so prosperous, My father wouldn’t mind if the family and the new city would be one.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence makes the prince feel a little touched, the original call is only from two points. First, it is more sincere in the face-to-face incident of such a major event. Another point is to observe his attitude towards the order. I did not expect to have this effect. He nodded. "Of course, as long as it takes time, every piece of land in the Grey Fort can become a comfortable place for people to live in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I will leave as soon as possible The fortress told the father about the news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are four other people, as well as all the nobles in the West," Roland added. "All families willing to accept this condition." The new city will accept them without any prejudice. You can banquets at the fortress castle and spread my words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean, let me To inform them?" Pei Luo stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," the prince laughed. "This time... you will be my ambassador."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following, Your Highness," the eldest son of honeysuckle, bowed his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was about to leave, Roland stopped him. "Right, you have done a good job with the witch. Now you don't need to cover it again." Cover up. Education for all is now, people who still have expectations and obsessed with the church can completely remove the Western environment. You can decide what to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Peer Hermon retired, Roland stretched out and continued to look at the various project statistics from the City Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the influence of heavy snow, Wang Guo Avenue has been suspended, and the construction of residential buildings has been slowed down. Basically, only some indoor decoration work is carried out. Fortunately, a large number of earthen caves built before the lotus walk basically meet the needs of the follow-up refugees. Even if the number of refugees continues to increase, it is only necessary to add more people to each cave. This is the advantage of the fire. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Ministry of Construction, at least 60% of workers are currently in a state of no work, which makes some temporary recruitments issued by the City Hall become popular. For example, cleaning up snow on the street, transporting mines in the blast furnace area, and so on. If in other cities, there are so many people who are enthusiastic about work in the evil month, it is an incredible phenomenon. It is necessary to know that winter is the most difficult day for civilians. Most people are at home, and it is normal to rely on the food saved in autumn. However, in the eyes of Roland, when I saw so many labor idle, I felt that I was unwilling, and I thought that I might do something and use them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the Margaret Chamber of Commerce has tossed away the last batch of steam engines this year. The city hall has plenty of money and food. He has a lot of plans to implement. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Roland asked the guard to call the construction minister Carl Vabert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After explaining his ideas, Karl couldn’t help but widen his eyes. "Do you want stonemasons and mud craftsmen to build ships for you?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said in a serious way, "Yes, the location is located near the pier, the temporary factory building is set up with wood, and the fire is heated inside the room to ensure the temperature. Push directly into the water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Your Highness, how could they know how to make this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Of course, just like building a witch building," Roland pulled out a piece of paper and drew a picture, "supporting the formwork, laying steel bars, pouring concrete... I will guide you on how to build the first ship, to the back. It is up to you to supervise the vessel so that all workers can be used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
