			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you go deep into the mine, the more humid the environment inside the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilvey carefully avoided the dripping drops of water at the top, holding the torch slowly in the hole - even without light, the real eye It won't be blocked by the dark, it's just to save the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To the fork," stopped at the front of the night, "Is this the first few caves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first fork of the 23rd and the second door," Lightning took out a look at the record book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope this is the end," Hilly muttered and opened the eyes that were completely shaped by magic. "Left... out of the mine, no mine. Right Side...the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning writes down the result, "Then, the last door in this cave needs to be checked."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go," the nightingale went from the front of the team to the end, and returned with everyone. Her abilities don't seem to be just invisible. Sylvie can only faintly see the magic of nightingale changes, but she can't capture her figure and movement. According to the introduction of lightning, she is the strongest fighting witch of the Communist Youth League. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the reason why Roland let her follow herself - there are rumors that the mine was once the nest of an ancient monster, and several miners have happened before. The missing event. Before the departure, His Royal Highness must be careful again. If you encounter an undetermined situation, you should first withdraw from the mine and report to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi does not agree with this, no monster can escape the detection of the magic eye, even the animal corpses and twisted soft worms in the stone wall, she Can be seen clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Expedition" has a total of four people, in addition to her, nightingale, lightning, there is a little girl named Lucia. Every time she discovers the ore, she transforms it into various crumbs, and then carefully sorts it into her pocket, saying it is to be given to her highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning is responsible for mapping the topographic map of the mine. Of course, according to her own opinion, no adventure can be missed for any adventure - this proud tone makes Xi Ervi couldn't help but think of the captain who was stationed on the sleeping island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 23rd cave belongs to a huge deep hole near the bottom of the mining area. After several hundred steps, it is divided into three winding roads, continuing along these winding roads. In-depth, we will find more support, but it will almost extend the scope of the mining area, and there are very few possibilities for possessing the veins, so they will only go deep into this step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the original fork, the "gate" of the lightning record, Sylvester showed his ability to observe the 23rd cave and three more Happening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wider the scope of the real eye, the greater the magic consumption, and the heavy burden on the body, so she chose to observe once at each fork, once a probe One channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three more... um, no mine, there is at the end..." She groaned. "There are five martyrdoms, and one of them seems to be down." Wrapped around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Down?" Lightning repeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is indeed the case," Sylvie looked at again, and the slender passage did not take long to turn a corner, straight to the mining area. Come, when she wanted to continue watching along this ramp, a strong sense of dizziness poured into her mind, interrupting her connection with the magic eye. "I think it might lead to a deposit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this explanation is very far-fetched. The intricate caves in the North Slope mine are obviously not artificially excavated, and they are not specifically looking for ore - an unknown vein previously discovered. It is sandwiched between the two ramps. If it is not the real eye that can penetrate the obstacle, it is impossible to find the pile of metal stones hidden under the stone wall and the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whatever it is, just look at it," said the night sherbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrians entered the third door of the cave and arrived at the end of the passage about a quarter of an hour later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
