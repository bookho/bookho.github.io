			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, everyone packed up the campsite and set off again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also found a detail: even if sleeping in the wilderness, the appearance of the witches will not be eclipsed, and he obviously can't do this. You can guess without looking in the mirror. Your hair is definitely a mess. The face is lack of blood color due to insomnia. There is a semi-dry sweat on the skin. It feels slightly sticky. In your eyes, there is nothing like a listless look. . He relieved this discomfort until he washed it slightly with the drinking water in the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland began to miss the tap water system in the castle and the spacious shower room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the lookout arrived at the scheduled location - the side of the snowy mountain in accordance with the instructions of the lightning. Hovering over the vast sea, a group of people can already see the scene behind the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As lightning has said, the rear of the snow-capped mountains is covered with a red mist, the fog is very low, and the closer to the ground, the more intense the color. In order to see further, Roland let the hot air balloon continue to rise, and the land at the end of the field of vision is spread out a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did you find?" He looked at Sylvie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter shook his head. "No, the distance is too far, and it is beyond the scope of the real eye."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When we have drawn the scene here, we will be closer," Roland said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While taking photos with Soroya, he also used the lookout to observe the coastal line. In addition to the cliffs, there are rocky beaches on the coast. There are no man-made buildings such as docks and docks. It seems that even if there are devils, they have never thought of building ships and attacking the gray castle from the sea. This observation made him a little relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the hot air balloon slowly approached the land, Sylvie finally began to report what she saw - probably about ten miles from the beach, she found A pile of black stone buildings, triangular, resembles a spire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just like the mirage seen in the wild," Wendy couldn’t help but exclaimed. "It’s really the territory of the devil!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the height is obviously wrong," Soloya frowned. "The spires in the mirage are as high as a hundred feet, and it is impossible to be covered by red fog. They should be more than the rolling hills. Higher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you see the city of the devil, and here is just the village of the devil?" Anna guessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the devil has a complete and unique urban system that belongs to a higher evolutionary group and is keen on expansion and killing? Roland thought, please, don't be like this. "What are there in the spires?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... most of the spires are empty, some inside It seems to be full of liquids...etc." Sylvia groaned and then dared not set the channel. "Come on, the devil found us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Found?" Roland lifted the lookout and swept his eyes, still a dark red, and could not see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are in action," Hilly said nervously. "It turned out that they were all buried in the ground, only showing the pipes on their backs, over there... ...the devil is flying!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wenty, retreat at full speed!" Roland ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blew quickly, and the sudden movement of the hot air balloon caused the basket to tilt, and the tight rope made a creaking sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Sylvie’s warning made everyone feel cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two devils are coming to us, they can ride on the mount!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hell, this group of guys actually have flying mounts? Roland's eyes widened, which is unreasonable. I want to be able to bear a big man. How big is the mount? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not long after, he captured two black spots from his vision. Looking through the lookout mirror, I saw that the mounts on their knees were sharp and fangs, and they were hairless, and the birds could not be hooked. If you don't read it wrong... this is actually a mixture of two evil beasts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
