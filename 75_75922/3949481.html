			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large early morning, Roland was awakened by the cold. He climbed out of the cold bed, put on a wool coat, and dipped his feet in a warm bucket. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the privilege he can enjoy as a prince of the prince - every morning, the maid will put the hot water on his bed. In addition to this, there is a clean towel and hot milk, which will make his body instantly warm. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, compared to the practice of warming the bed by the big aristocrats, he felt that he was enough to converge. The original four princes brought the maid, Tyre, to fight this idea, but unfortunately they did not enjoy it. Roland didn't like this practice, so he gave the vacant position to the old and experienced old maid. In fact, this choice is quite correct. At present, there are many witches in the castle, but she still plays inside and outside the castle. Well organized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame in the fireplace has long since been extinguished, leaving only the white fly ash. There was a cold wind blowing in the window behind, and it was hard to believe that it is still Zhongqiu. Roland wiped his feet and washed it with another pot of hot water. He went to the window and closed the window that opened for a night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the open flame fireplace is very common in this era, he is still worried about carbon monoxide poisoning, leaving a gap every night when sleeping. In the first half of the night, the indoor temperature can still be kept warm. As the firewood burns out, it is no different from the outdoor in the early hours of the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to think of a way to solve this problem, Roland thought, otherwise I would not sleep if I want to sleep late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast, he took the nightingale, the chief knight and a group of guards to the city wall for a routine tour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new city wall is separated from the old city wall by a large piece of grassland. Now it has become a piece of white, walking on the thick snow, the sole will be embarrassed. The sound of squeaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up, the sky was a touch of gray, and occasionally a bunch of snowflakes floated into his neck, bringing a trace of cold. He knows that such weather is likely to continue into the spring of ... even longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the line of defense?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Itâ€™s much better than the last one," Carter Lan Nice looks relaxed. "The first soldiers of the First Army have all been on the battlefield, and they have a revolver rifle. A wall of about 100 meters can be used to guard the evil beasts underneath." The wall is half a meter higher than the previous stone wall, and it is difficult for the wolf to jump directly to the city. It is completely for the soldiers to practice shooting. As long as there is no mixed kind of evil beast, this group of monsters will not want to cross the line of defense." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland climbed the wall, and the soldiers stood tall on the way. They salute him. As far as this spirit is concerned, it has already been judged by the original militia fighters. At that time, although everyone stood on the wall, it seemed to puncture the wooden gun neatly, but it was just a conditional reflection formed by repeated training of one action. Their eyes were full of numbness and the movements were stiff. If you look closely, you can still find that most of the people's legs are shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the soldiers have a confident look in their eyes, and after the ceremony, they will re-focus their attention and continue to monitor the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going along the wall to the side of the fascinating forest, it seems to be a lot of fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temporary shelters built for serfs and fugitives are located in this area, looking down from the wall, only to see the long strips of soil along one another Arranged, like undulating wavy lines. There are more than ten rooms in each raised slope, and the structure is exactly the same as that of the cave. The thick soil wall can maintain the indoor temperature, plus the heating artifacts, the linen can be kept away from the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole residence is divided into two large blocks. The block near the city wall is called the West District, which is used to house the fugitives; the east area far from the city wall is divided into serfs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Hall sends people to distribute food and charcoal every day, and the fugitives need to provide logistics for the first army to protect the walls; as for serfs, they Most of them have saved enough of the wheat they need. Except for some people who are thinking about their activities, they are looking for a miscellaneous job and earning extra money for themselves. Others rarely leave the warm house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
