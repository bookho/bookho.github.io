			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The No. 6 Fortress Gun was the squad of the squadron before the attack. Due to the position close to the edge of the position, there was almost no other attack except the two waves of spears. It can be resumed by simply replenishing the manpower compared to the artillery that was hit by the fearful beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less than a minute after receiving the parameters, the fortress gun spurted out the anger at the target position! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance of two kilometers makes the arc of the shells extremely low. On the battlefield, both human soldiers and devils have heard the special kind of warheads whizzing past. The whistle--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the difference is that the latter immediately ushered in a thunderous roar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the heart of war has once again returned to its field! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accuracy of the large-caliber artillery in this distance is no longer erratic, and the first flowering bomb falls exactly on the edge of a crawling monster - a violent explosion Directly flipped over half of its body, the open outer shell was missing, leaving its internal flesh completely exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the kill, there is a team of madmen beside the crawling monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at their posture, apparently watching out for the witch’s raid, but under the pressure of mortars, they have to shrink in the squatting “big spider” Next, I hope to rely on the outer limbs of the stone to block the shrapnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the face of the difference in caliber, the move became meaningless, and the energy generated by the explosion was easily passed to them through crawling monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock wave smashed the visceral viscera and bones in the blink of an eye, making them look like a solid body like water ripples, waiting for the dust to land, only around the heart There is a dead body in the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hit hit!" Hillvi couldn’t help but wave his fist. "The next goal is... 12 degrees and 6 points, 2,480 meters away!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, support will be available soon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, being tortured The devil who had been bombarded by the shells finally entered the area one kilometer before the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone thinks that the war is about to usher in a victory, the enemy’s offensive has come to an abrupt end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire process lasted less than ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madman who rushed to the front once approached the 500 meters in the north slope, which was the first barbed wire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that's it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the threat of fearful beasts, all the machine guns on the front line, including the high-altitude machine guns, aimed the guns at the engulfing enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire battlefield can be described as boiling almost at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The firepower of the First Army was no longer the same as that of the Cold Wind Ridge. At that time, a limited number of heavy machine guns were carefully placed. In the bunker, and only used to deal with the most threatening targets, now you can finally tilt the ammunition to any enemies that are in the process of shooting - even if such "squandering" can only insist on one battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the 500-meter range became the first killing field for the precision shooting team in the trench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the devil, usually do not put obstacles such as barbed wire in their eyes, their strong body is enough to jump over, or the stakes Uprooted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the eyes of snipers, this is no different from finding a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the devil found that he couldn’t get close to the spear distance anyway, the crash could no longer be controlled - it’s not related to discipline and morale, Like the desperation of the beast's intuition. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They dropped a thousand bodies before the line of defense and turned back like a tide, and in the process, the machine gun always kept on fire until the gun The tube was baked red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
