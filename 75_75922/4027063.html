			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Roland told Tilly and others about the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She actually gave the witches to those shameless nobles as compensation?" Not waiting for the five kings to open their mouths, the ashes rushed up, if not With Andrea holding it, it is estimated that she has already gone straight to the dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Yelts has already confirmed?" Tilly asked calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just a simple test of two sentences, she has recruited everything," Roland told me in detail about what happened in the prison. "I thought it would not be like this." I can get the results soon, she is more fragile than I thought." According to his assumption, yesterday’s inquiry was only routine intimidation, and did not want to ask something. If the other party refused to let go, the subsequent interrogation It is a dinner. Because of this, he did not unlock the lock of God's punishment on Herti, and Hetty did not know that the ability to lie in the nightingale was not judged by the sound, but by the observation of the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out," Tilly nodded. "Thank you for doing this for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I am your brother, don't be so polite," Roland said. "And then, Herti Morgan is also a witch on the island, and it should be handed over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand..." Tilly was silent for a while. "If this happened in Wintertown, what would you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at her jewel-like eyes, and saw a little sadness and regret in the gray pupil, but more of a silent anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be like you." Roland comforted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is equivalent to the death sentence of Herti Morgan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly no longer hesitated, she whispered to the ashes and whispered a few words, nodded, and turned away from the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will leave, brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that Tilly’s mood Very low, this time Roland couldn't say anything. When he was about to get up and send her back to the Witch Building, there was an exclamation of excitement behind him. It was from the listening of the magic stone in the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here is lightning, repeat, here is lightning, Axia has found the time of the change!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The little girl’s words made the people in the room feel awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, what did she see?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The huge mouth, the tentacles, the two monsters, I don't know how to describe it," the lightning sounds excited to the extreme. "This is an unprecedented discovery." , my God... Your Majesty, you'd better come see it yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Tilly wondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are exploring the devil camp behind the snow-capped mountains, where the red fog disappeared before a week ago," Roland explained briefly. These things are going to tell you today, just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I almost forgot the devil's business," Tilly took a deep breath. But in more detail, you can tell me on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the road?" Roland made a slight glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't I go with you?" She blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the five-year-old woman who was very strong from an early age. When she encounters a key incident, she can immediately adjust her mentality and throw her personal emotions behind her head. The essential qualities of a ruler. Roland secretly feels that at this point, her talent is far better than herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bringing Tilly’s words means that Ashes and Andrea will also accompany them, and the safety factor will increase greatly. There is absolutely no reason for not agreeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hetty leaned against the cage and waited for Roland to take her out of the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody teeth will be completely finished, and Tilly will not allow herself to return to the sleeping island, but as the Morgan royal family, she has found a new restoration. the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to rely on the secular power of the Grey Fort Kingdom to help them regain their throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hetty is more convinced of the rewards he has made than the other’s promises - perhaps he just has a relationship with Tilly, and he is not allowed to agree directly. Asking the whereabouts of the witches is also to give an account of the sleeping island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is convinced that no aristocrat can turn a blind eye to such a big temptation - half a wolfful, fertile land will bring him unimaginable wealth and prestige And his name will be engraved in the history books, and will continue to be passed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for yourself? Perhaps it will be embarrassed by the aristocrats of the later generations, but she does not care, as long as she can become the king of the wolf heart, everything can be abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she can formally revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who have forsaken her and abandoned their father's revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She vowed to hang those traitors one by one, hanging at the gates of the city to announce to everyone, this is the end of the people who framed Morgan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the iron door of the basement was pushed open, and the creaking friction was particularly loud in the silent dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hetty immediately climbed up and looked at the end of the passage with the railing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is not Roland Wimbledon who appears in her view, but the ashes of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly felt a chill rising from the soles of her feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, what are you doing here, what is Roland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am here You should be aware of the purpose, "the ashes step by step to the cage - the other side takes a step, and Heti will step back, but soon, she has no way to retreat," when you put innocent When the witch is handed over to the nobility, she should have expected such a day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Herti screamed. "Roland promised not to After considering this matter, he has forgiven me. You are in violation of the king's order! Where is he? I want to see him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The iron railings, which were hard to open, bent down into the prison. "Those witches came with sorrow, hoping to find the forerunner's shelter in the blood, hope to sleep without the church arrest." A sense of security, I hope that I will not worry about what I eat every day, but you have failed them. Not only that, but they also sent them to hell. The witches escaped teaching. The containment is harmed by his own kind, even if Roland will forgive you, I can't think that nothing has happened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy... Did you overhear the conversation with Roland? Or did he tell them about these things? Herti horrifiedly locked the lock of the gods between the necks, but it was completely wrapped in a hoop and could not be removed by fingers alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will help you," Ashes approached the wall, reached for her neck and lifted her up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the huge grip, the hoop began to tighten inward, and Hetty quickly felt difficulty breathing - her body twisted like a dehydrated fish, double The ankles are trying to find a fulcrum, but all attempts are useless; the line of sight is gradually blurred, and the gray figure becomes erratic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t want to die here, she is the only successor to the throne It is the king of the wolf in the future...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne of the fangs seems to be away from her, and the laughter of the aristocrats sneaked back to the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
