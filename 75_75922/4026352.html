"Why are you asking this - I never thought about leaving you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't mean that," Tilly knew she misunderstood. "Just just from the point of preference...this is not a bad place, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes hesitated for a moment, and finally nodded, "The Aid is willing to stay and work for Roland, there is no reason. But we are different, we have our own homes-"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is only three endings in this war," Tilly interrupted her. "The first type, we can't stop the offensive of God's penalty, and die in the north, so no matter Whether it is a sleeping island or a winter city, it has nothing to do with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will never sleep in that place, I swear by my life," Ashes Quickly reached out and grabbed the mouth of the five kings, and used the honorific words in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly looked at her with a smile, until she let go of her hand and said softly, "I don't think I will die in the church." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then don't say it," Ashes worried. "You always say what comes..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a word," Tilly walked into the small window of the kitchen and looked at the vibrant castle back garden. "So I put it in the front. The second case is Roland." It has failed, but we have all survived. As a result, the entire Grey Fortress will be unable to block the church, and no winter city will fall into the sea of ​​fire. He has only one place to go."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sleeping Island?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, we will continue to oppose the oppression of the church until the war of divineity comes. Complete destruction It is very likely that after a few hundred years, that is not what we can manage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third one..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The third is that we defeated the church and uprooted the holy city of Hermes," Tilly smiled. "All witches can get out of insults and persecution and get real liberation. When the day comes, the mission of Sleeping Island is over.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“结...束?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was originally used as a savior home for witches. After the church collapsed, we naturally did not need to bind everyone to the fjord island. In terms of living environment, the fjord is not a good place, lack of materials, The weather is changeable... Of course, the sleeping island will not be abandoned, and the sleeping charm will continue to operate, but you can choose your favorite city life, isn't it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Even if it is the devil's abyss of the devil, I will be by your side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same is true for the world of salted fish and fish soup? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃-"The ash is not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tili couldn’t help but laugh out loud. "Reassured, I will be tired of it. Maybe I will come to the Winter City for a while." "Change the taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are here to say?" Andrea asked the door probe and saw her head in the tub, even The bathrobes have been changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do?" Ashes frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bath," she said, "I have been on the boat for more than ten days, and the salty taste of the body is overflowing. Of course, some people are aware. Not too late, Tilly, do you want to go with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay," Tilly said. "Wait for me to change." Clothes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough... Then I will go down," Ashes pretended to be inadvertently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please, I didn't invite you." Andrea gave her a blank look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
