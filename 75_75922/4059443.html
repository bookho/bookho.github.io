			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time to bury black powder and detonators is much longer than Roland expected, mainly because it is very troublesome to transport a bucket of gunpowder to a preset location outside the city wall. The snow that has not passed the knees has caused the carriage to be quite inconvenient. Whenever there is a beast infested, it has to interrupt the transportation. Even if there is a lotus to assist in digging and filling the landfill, it took nearly a week to arrange it properly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure the best detonation effect, all the gunpowder in the buried area is detonated by the electric detonator - the latter principle is very simple, because it does not consider carrying and storage, basic It is composed of a small sealed copper tube and two wires. The copper tube is filled with fire cotton, and the thin copper wire is placed between the wires to form a short circuit. When the current passes, the copper wire will melt and ignite, and at the same time detonate the surrounding fire cotton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drawn wire is completely submerged through the lotus, and the depth of nearly five meters ensures that the line will not be subjected to ground artillery or evil animals even without casing protection. influences. In the end, all the wires are merged into the console on the wall. To detonate which area of ​​gunpowder, just shake the corresponding hand-cranked generator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the exercise only left the last preparatory work - the live target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, this hunting and evil beast action, friendship first, competition second, protection of safety is the highest priority, can not leave the leaf surveillance area, understand "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing on the wall, Roland looked into the front row of "entrants." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to be fair, and to reduce the burden on the leaves, the participating witches have a total of three groups of six, namely the Ashes and Andrea of ​​the Sleeping Island team, There is no lightning and wheat squad of the Wintertown team, as well as Felice and Ai Gesha of the Takira team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, he wanted to make Effie and Annie come together as a team of wolves, but why the latter are not willing to participate in hunting, other wolves and witches Without fighting ability, he had to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand!" The people replied in unison, especially Andrea Quinn, who was very motivated. Since the taste of chaotic drinks, the aristocratic witch from the head of the three great families in the morning sun has completely indulged in the unique taste of the fire dragon wine, and even hopes to use a month of chaotic drink share in exchange for the only half of the only fire dragon wine. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Roland’s reply is that if you can win the first, it is not impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rules are very simple, one day is limited, who can catch more evil beasts who is the first, but must be locked into the cage to count. He pointed to the iron cage below the wall. "In addition, if someone leaves the surveillance area of ​​the leaf, the team is directly disqualified. Then the hunting operation is now starting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "喔!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, lightning and Mai Hao took the lead to fly to the lost forest, the remaining two teams can only rely on Legs trek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who do you think can win?" After all three teams entered the wall, Tilly smiled and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her smile, Roland always felt a little different meaning, "Oh... I guess it should be lightning and wheat. Their ability is indeed It is not the strongest, but it is necessary to put the evil beast into the cage to count the scores. The quickness of action is undoubtedly more dominant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is better to make a bet "Brother," she said, raising her mouth. "I guess it is the first to sleep in the island group."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia and Ashes? Luo Lansi said, these two people are full-time remote combat witches, one is more extraordinary, and there is no doubt about the strength. However, it is very easy for them to annihilate the enemy. It is more difficult to arrest. If you want to get back smoothly, you must fight every evil beast to death. The energy spent is far greater than killing the target directly. I am afraid that there will be some difficulties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be a business that makes a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I win, um...sell in the future The income from chaotic drinks, I hope to spend half of the reward for those witches who have made outstanding contributions to urban development."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
