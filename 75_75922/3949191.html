			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as the beginning of the construction of the cement section, Roland set a plan for the subsequent trials of several projects, most of which were built around the northern slope mining area. It can be effectively concentrated and guarded – the construction of such a brick-and-wooden wooden ceiling is extremely fast and does not affect the construction progress of the city wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saltpeter purchased from Liuye Town was transported to a nearby warehouse for storage. When it is needed, it will be weighed by the helper and sent in batches. bungalow. The same is true for charcoal and sulphur. The handling and mixing of the three raw materials is done by different groups of people, thus minimizing the risk of leaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland weighed twenty pounds from the prepared black powder and slowly fell on a cut sheepskin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These gunpowders have been soaked, compacted, aired, mashed, sieved, etc., have been uniformly granulated, and have excellent combustion performance. In order to prevent static accidents, a metal vessel was not used throughout the production process, mostly ceramic or log products. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing the gunpowder, Roland layered the sheepskin layer, wrapped it to three layers, and tied it with a rope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you do this?" Carter asked. Can this thing be called a weapon in front of you? Although it is a modified product of snow powder, who can hold it by sound alone? Dealing with a farmer who has never been to the battlefield may have a role, and no trained warriors and mercenaries will look at it. However, the Chief Cavalier carefully considered it. The things that His Royal Highness has done recently seem to be unreasonable, but most of the effects are amazing. If the evil beast IQ is similar to the beast, maybe this stuff will be unexpectedly effective? For example, a violent scream made them frightened and sneaked away, thus reducing the pressure on the defending team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland put the wrapped gunpowder into Carter’s arms and took the bag for the fine powder of the gunpowder. “Almost, we went outside the city wall.” The iron axe should be ready."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About two miles west of the wall, an empty space between the lost forest and the desolate mountains is his The test area that was drawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axe and several other hunters have been waiting here for a long time, except for the iron axe, everyone is a local, and the best one of the archery . I heard that the prince had a task assigned to them, and immediately could not wait to follow the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now everyone knows that the new lords of Bentham Town never pay for employment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Roland, they set up long wooden poles around them, tied the ropes, and surrounded the warning ring in nearly half a mile. Knight patrols were arranged in the direction of the wall to prevent accidental proximity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland checked around the warning circle and nodded. "Is the prey brought?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Your Highness, all here," the iron axe dragged a cage and came forward, Carter noticed that there were a few pheasants and rabbits inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, put them on the distance of five steps, ten steps, fifteen steps, thirty steps from the center point, each piece is tied to one Only."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter shook his head and shook his head. He suggested, "His Royal Highness, these animals you choose may not be tested, and they are timid. If you can scare them, you won't be able to scare away the evil beasts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Scared the evil beast?" Roland Pico Oh, then I reacted. "I didn't intend to scare them away, even though the sound of this stuff exploded is amazing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked to the circle with the chief knight In the center, put down the gunpowder bag and draw a small mouth with the dagger to let the gunpowder leak out. Then take out the leather bag containing the powder of gunpowder, sprinkle it from the break, and then change back to the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is a windless weather, perfect for this original detonation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always exiting nearly a hundred meters, Roland only picked up the leather bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, just ignite here," he repeatedly estimated the distance, and after confirming it, he said to Carter, "Go and call the hunters." Come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment Roland is also a little excited, he has done a small amount of flash test before, he is not worried about the test results. What he cares is that this will be a great moment. From today, the hot weapon will be officially on the stage, and he will be a leader in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
