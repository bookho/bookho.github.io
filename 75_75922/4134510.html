			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fort, no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The situation at the time was almost like this..." Ashes told the battle process in detail, "When the fire goes out, the lightning searches north for about a hundred kilometers and finds According to the on-site analysis, it should be caused by the spiders passing through the forest. The number is small, about three or four."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Due to the interruption of the forest communication, Roland did not know the news of the attack of the leaves until the next evening. The next morning, he immediately asked Tilly and Wendy to drive the seagull to the terminal and took the party back without winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash is okay, it seems that there is almost no harm, but the leaves are the planes that have been carried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately fortunately, the sundial has planted a symbiotic species in her body, even though the leaves have been unconscious, from the perspective of the symbiotic It does not show too much pain, which means that the leaves consume much more spiritually than the actual damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pressed the distraction and moved his gaze to the big map on his desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire attack has a clear picture in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil commander did notice the strangeness of the lost forest - after all, the railway line turned from here, all the way toward the direction of Takira. But it did not choose to attack the trenches and barbed wire at the terminal, but instead placed the target on the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small group of people moved nearly 500 kilometers away from the ruins of Takula to the northern end of the forest - such a long march is bound to be impossible to support large forces The battle, presumably those spiders in addition to bear the arson task, but also carrying a lot of red fog cans. In a sense, this is also a motorized battle of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting the fire is only a scorpion that attracts the attention of the witch. Now, if you want to arrange an emergency strategy for the fire attack, the forest controllers are likely to stay. In situ, pay attention to the further development of the situation, and the enemy seized this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably in the eyes of the devil, it is the leaves that support the logistics of the First Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the forest controller is killed, the crisis on the front line can be lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the intention is somewhat biased, it can be counted as this step, which explains the extent to which the devil understands the magic - accurately guessing the ability of the leaf, and Sexual dagger attacks, relying on individual strength to attack long distances, taking into account the required advance and retreat time, can be said that each step is interlocking. If you don't have a deep understanding of the use of magic, it is impossible to achieve this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even suspected that the devil had seen similar abilities to the leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the enemy’s squad returned by the original route, it will take at least a week or so, and it’s not hard to catch up with the trailing spiders, but that It doesn't make much sense. The demon who can fly autonomously can drop the team to flee at any time. The chaser is less likely to be bitten by the anti-bite. If you send more, you can only kill a few spiders and some lower devils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, there is no good counter-measure in the secret operations of this elite team, and most important witches are protected by witches. And like leaves, wheat, lightning, and so on, how to arrange protection is impossible to drip. Fortunately, there are not many high-level devils with such abilities, and there will be obvious magical signs when attacking at full speed. As long as the retreat is placed first, the enemy is not so easy to succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that people care about is the conversation between the demon and the ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devil... Was it a human speaker? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same as a high-level devil, Kabradabi, who is caught alive, does not have this ability. If you do not connect through Carmela, you will even have basic Communication can't be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Learning is the foundation of evolution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the rumors that the first battle of the gods had not been opened, some people had come into contact with the devil... It was a human being who imparted knowledge to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words and the rumors mentioned by Pasha alternated in Roland's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, he always feels that this sorcerer reveals a sense of pride when he mentions it for hundreds of years, as if it’s really There are countless changes in general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a problem, is it the devil from the time of the federation...and even earlier? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did it learn the human language? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But... this is incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Roland meditated, Wendy’s voice suddenly came from outside the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty," she pushed the door open, "the leaves woke up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Come," Roland stood up and looked at the ashes. "Would you like to go together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary person nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," he stopped when he walked past the other side. "Before forgetting, thank you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that it is unharmed, it does not mean that it is not hurt. Only when it is close will it be noticed that there are several shallow scars on the face and finger joints of the ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whirlwind that can blow the leaves naturally will not be as soft as the spring breeze. Such a small injury will not stay in the extraordinary for more than one day. But it still does not heal now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, in the event of a mistake, it can be fatally wounded and difficult to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intensity of this battle is obviously not as simple as she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash calmly accepted this thanks, she just lowered her eyes and looked at Roland with a golden eye. "Take good to Tilly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, even if you don't say it -" Roland grinned and understood what the other person meant. This is in itself a matter of reason, just like she saved the leaves. The extraordinary person who looked like a rectum would have such a mind. He couldn't help but smile. "Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the leaves of the bedroom, the room is full of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna, Nightingale, Tilly, Book, Mystery... Almost all the first witches who joined the Alliance gathered here to see the arrival of Roland, everyone Have given up an aisle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the crowd, he saw the leaves that had been sitting up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her emerald green hair is a little messy, her face is slightly pale, but there is not much feeling of embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes are still bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty," the leaves whispered, "Let you worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You are fine..." Roland sighed, and the previous coma was caused by mental exhaustion. But he also knows that the phrase "nothing is fine" is a bit reluctant. The leaves are also subjected to a "curse" similar to lightning. The internal trauma caused by the forced interruption of the heart of the jungle still exists. At most, it can only be said that it will not endanger. Life is gone. "I have already heard the ashes in the specific situation. You should take a rest. You don't have to take care of the forest for the time being. As for your injuries, I will definitely find a way-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head. "No, kneel, please let me go back to the front."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leaves!" The nightingale couldn't help but come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
