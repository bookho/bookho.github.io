			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina has a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whip of the whip, the curse of the enemy, and the pain of the heart gradually drifted away from her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one piece left white, and the ground is so smooth that it can reflect her appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world seems to have no boundaries, the only sign is a tall stone gate in the distance. There is a faint music coming from behind the door, sacred and pleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the scene that people saw before they died, she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing this last distance, you will be able to reach the eternal peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fahina is not too reconciled, and in the end has not been able to hand traitors, to avenge everyone who followed her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, she still has a lot of embarrassment, and the things that Tok Taal’s trust is finally put into the water... she really is not a single-handed material, even Not a qualified leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Own talent is just that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that makes people feel at ease is that she didn’t say a word for mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially when the red iron needle pierced the fingertips, she almost thought that she would completely collapse in the next moment, now in retrospect, it can still last until the end I feel a little incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise she wouldn’t be able to face the same robes that took the first step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these emotions did not last long, just like dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, she will soon enter sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how you think about it, there is no way to change it, isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina went step by step to Shimen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no more pain and sorrow in the legend, time will solidify, and everything will remain at the most glamorous moment, as the cornerstone of the kingdom of God. presence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be a happy thing, but somehow she is not happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly... Why? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farina..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she was, there was a bang around her the sound of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s Joe’s voice-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s not involved in the attack, it’s impossible Lorenzo captured, so this is just her illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, Farina suddenly felt relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out to be the case, she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just doesn't want a person to go through this last journey alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is entrusted with the responsibility of being far beyond her ability, even if it is shirking, it does not matter, she is eager to be felt by people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t want to go alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't go away, let me go with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will... "The voice replied intermittently. "Wherever I go, I will be with you... even if I die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to have returned to the winter a few years ago, alone to climb Hermes. Wandering in the snow, when the eyes are about to fall, a carriage stops in front of her...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina is on the steps of the stone gate, Reach out and push the door open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light behind the door burst forth and instantly enveloped her . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the light is gone, Farina opens her eyes and finds the ceiling above her head. It is slowly shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kingdom of the gods, is this the way? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn’t look as glamorous as you think...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and time doesn’t seem to stop flow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried to turn her head and saw a familiar face in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina hesitated for a moment, tentatively asked, "Joe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter Kneeling around her, like falling asleep. After shouting a few times, he opened his eyes in confusion and looked at her - then Joe's face showed a ecstasy look, "You... are you awake?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake up?" Farina frowned. "I shouldn’t have been...hey--" Just halfway through, she realized that the burning pain was back on her body, even if she moved. Drilling the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are just too tired and fainted," Joe grabbed her head. "Don't worry, everything will be fine."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina couldn’t help but stayed for a long while before she came back – she not only died, but also escaped from the dungeon, does that mean...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lorenzo--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting this unexpected answer, Farina’s spirit was suddenly revived. “Really? How did you do it?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not me who killed him," Joe shook his head. "It’s the king of the Grey Fort, Roland Wimbledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Roland Wimbledon... a name she most didn't want to hear. "What are you talking about? How could he help us to take back Dagong Island?" She said, she slammed into the surroundings. "Wait... Where is this? We are not on the island of Dagong?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are now in the sea, the destination is the no-winter city of the Grey Fort, and you have been in a coma for three days, relying on the drugs of the First Army to save your life." "Don't worry, I will tell you everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After half an hour, Farina understood what happened behind this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About the next trial, I also asked the guard, Sean," Joe said, "as long as there is no witch blood in his hand, no Those who have participated in persecution and have not slaughtered the people of the Grey Fort will not be sentenced to death. You are a warrior of the Pioneer Camp. They are stationed in the New Holy City and fight with the evil beasts. I used to be an assistant to the gods. Not the witches - that is, both of us are likely to survive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is more excited, "Although you are very hurt, But there is a witch in the winter city called Nana Va, no matter what kind of injury can be completely cured, just need to spend money! I will find a solution to the cost problem, even if she wants more, I will definitely let you re Stand up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo cut her hamstrings and tendons to prevent her from running away, and broke her knees with a hammer. Now she can be said to be a waste person. But this is not the focus of Farina's attention -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
