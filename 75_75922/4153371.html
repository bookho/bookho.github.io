			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the radish climbed out of the smashed glass window, the body was already scarred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the new car, itâ€™s no different from a bunch of rags at the moment - the twisted steel frame is almost twisted, and the body is almost half-shrinked, yellow The black oil oozes from the ground and gives off a pungent smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be a car accident that could not be survived. Without the protection of natural forces, she estimates that the body that had been deformed for a long time is confusing. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo endured the pain and tried to stand up. The bridge was already in a mess, the parts of the vehicle that were hit by flying were everywhere, and the truck was not far away, and the road was completely sealed. She turned her head and found that the rear was blocked by several cement mixers. Even if the car escaped the impact, it was impossible to leave the high-speed bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the accident is purely accidental, the driver behind should have already saved the person, but until now, she has not seen a figure, the entire bridge The silence is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is normal, she is afraid that she has already cried, but even though tears are spinning in her eyes, her body is shaking and she is clenching her teeth. Did not let the tears drip down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo often listens to his uncle and says that the demon will regard the person who awakens the power of nature as a target, and this may be an early premeditated ambush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the enemy, never show a weak posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not only help, but will also worsen its situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is no longer a child, but an awakened martial artist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sour rubbing sound broke the silence on the bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roof of the truck that fell over the ground was torn from the inside, and a masked figure came out of the cab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a terrible car accident, it is unharmed and can tear the car body by hand. This is obviously not something that ordinary people can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo could not help but close the car behind the scrap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the mask, she felt like a very bitter chill rising from the soles of her feet. Obviously, she could not see the other's eyes, but she could feel that all the attention of the other party was concentrated on her, just like a poisonous snake staring at the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the goal you have to deal with? She looks like a little ghost with no hair." Then there are two "monsters" from above the car. Appearing, one can barely see the human form, but the hands and feet are somewhat deformed, the other is with wings and fangs, and the legendary gargoyle is no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the sorcerer may have changed, so it is not surprising to evolve into what it looks like. From the red cyclone that shines on their chests, it can be concluded that the two are undoubtedly the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of little girl, there is no need to mobilize the crowd, just to find a chance to bite, she will not even have a chance to call for help. Better, let me Let God take away her life for God--" Like a singer-like demon, a smirk gives a smirk, and when he opens his wings, he prepares to rush toward Jieluo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is the mask person who blocks it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw that the latter raised his finger and turned slightly to the next finger. The enemy who just leaped was like an invisible palm falling to the ground, hitting There is a crack in the strength of the Dalian bridge deck! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Idiot, who allows you to act without permission?" The mask man whispered. "You don't know what kind of opponent you are facing." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, she is not... the martial arts family who just awakened?" The long-handed singer was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but not the general martial arts. You can only see her faint cyclone, but I can see her shining light." Mask The man bowed to the little girl. "Is it right? The world's founder, Miss Jieluo?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
