			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa turned up a hill, from which you can already see the outline of the castle of Bianzhu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally came back, he thought, it took nearly a month and a half to go, and it only took seven days to come back. The main time was spent in Silver City to Chishui City. On the way. Although the ashes did not care, he still chose a path that was sparsely populated, reducing the possibility of being targeted by the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes are the witches who are called guides. Tassa is also not sure whether this name is true or not. She always wore a black robe when she was on the road, carrying a big sword wrapped in cloth. The long black hair is simply tied into a ponytail, dangling from the waist. Whether riding or taking a boat, she rarely pays attention to herself, but walks alone in front and looks around at the scenery. Perhaps for her, this trip to Bianbu Town is just a relaxing sightseeing tour. journey of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes Tassa will also doubt her own judgment, is she really a warrior? The robes are not close to the body and are easy to cripple. The long hair is equal to the flaws, and the ash seems to be completely afraid of starting from behind her. The one he sees the most is the back of the other. He does not think that witches are born to believe in others. They can only guess that she has the ability to protect herself. Even the stone of punishment can not threaten her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa took a circle around the hillside and quickly found the target - a flagpole with red strips hanging. He digs a bag from the mud on the edge of the flagpole, replaces the red flag with the folded blue strip, then clap his hands and sit on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is fine?" asked Ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They said so," Tasha wiped the sweat from his forehead. "Go to the foothills of the northeast of the town, follow a stone path." On the other hand, we found the flagpole at the top of the mountain and replaced the blue flag. Our people will notice it." The co-help club will only act at night, so let's wait here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash nodded, and found a clean place to sit down and reach out, "eat." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...and so on," he untied his backpack and took out a piece of dried meat from it, first peeling off half of the piece and stuffing it into his mouth. Throw the rest to the other party.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the witch’s mouth chewing on the dried meat, Tassa sighed. In addition to a big sword, actually There isn't even a copper eagle. If you don't have a penny, you dare to rush to the border town with your own money. The accommodation and food on the way are paid by yourself. The room must be a single-person bedroom, and the food must be meat. And portable foods such as dry foods have to be eaten half by him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably in areas where capacity is not enough, she is still very cautious. Is it prudent not to prepare food yourself?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The place we are going, across the strait. "The ashes swallowed the dried meat and suddenly opened the door. "I don't know if you have heard the rumors of the fjord. There are countless islands, some of which are very harsh and inaccessible. We are going to build a home belonging to the witch there. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Tassa was stunned. No matter how he inquired before, the other party closed his mouth and did not answer. How do you suddenly take the initiative to mention this?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you feel weird, why haven’t I disclosed anything to you before? She explained it earnestly. "Because if you are a liar, if you sleep at night and rush to report to the church, the girls are likely to be cut off halfway, and they are poisoned." But now, they should have been on the merchant ship to the fjord, even the church could not stop it. In addition, I am here to take away the witches of the Communist Youth League. These news, they will know sooner or later, it is of little significance to continue to conceal. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if you bring you here, you can't rule out the possibility that I am a liar." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, that's true." "The ashes said in a word, "If the end is not a witch, then you will die here, with those who are trying to get started with the witch." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Tassa sighed. "Can I ask other questions?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought for a moment, "If I can answer." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
