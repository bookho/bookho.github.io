			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The enemy found us! Fast, pack things up and board the car, everyone evacuated by the way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it is not clear why the First Army knew the action of the Devil, but after listening to the order, Farina flew to the truck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She skillfully closes the exhaust valve and pushes the two handles of the control cube switch back to the starting position, the front cylinder trembles violently, the pressure gauge The pointer is also moving to the right at a speed visible to the naked eye, and in a short time it reaches the standard point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that as long as the brakes are released, the car can move at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She poked her head and looked in the direction of the hillside, only to see the misty mountain top just now, it is now much clearer. The red mist that is like a suffocating air is dissipating at a speed visible to the naked eye. At the same time, many sesame-sized black spots appear on the white slope. They rush down the ramp and rush toward the direction of the team, just like a nest. Ant colony. In the sky, there are dozens of flying monsters, and they will never let them go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene caused Farina to think of the walls of the Hermes Plateau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, tens of thousands of evil beasts are like this against the line of defense of the trial army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Departure!" A godly witch patted her door, which is a signal that all players have completed the evacuation preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina took a deep breath and pulled up the brake lever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steam truck slowly moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other groups also started their trucks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From turning to U-turn to driving away from the shooting area, everyone is doing impeccably, even more perfect than the assessment, but even so, the enemy and the enemy The distance has not been pulled apart. When the team was upgraded to the highest speed, the chasers from the air were closer to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...not good, they are too fast, so we will be caught up!" Joe anxiously shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina is holding the steering wheel unmoved, and the wings are always faster than the ground. This can be counted as common sense. Since the enemy has even flying troops, it is only a matter of time before they are caught up. Considering that the Grey Fortress and the Devil have been fighting for a long time, they should not know this. The only hope now is that they have already prepared for this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how the first army should respond, it will be a battle she can't intervene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So her most important task at the moment is to take control of the truck and not to drag the other people’s hind legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t go after the chase, help me stare at the road ahead, and remind me if there is a pit!” She didn’t change her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy swallowed, then nodded hard, "I know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For more than an hour, the only thing Gode can see is the tailgate of the Seagull and the track lights that flicker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being in the clouds for a long time, he lost his sense of direction and height. The flight in this state is a huge loss to his physical strength and spirit. All attention must be gathered to maintain the position of the aircraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the change of the compass, the Air Knights, except for the beginning, flew north, and the rest of the time was hovering in an airspace, apparently Wait for the enemy to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for where other companions are, what is the current situation, there is no clue in Goode’s heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this lingering feeling of sorrow and depression, the bad environment in the clouds is also a big problem, the moist water vapor is on the windshield and the cabin. A layer of fine cream was condensed. Although the cold wind was blocked by the rubber lining of the flight suit, the moisture still took away some of the body temperature, making his hands and feet as dull as a piece of wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Royal Highness Terry has revealed that His Majesty is studying a communication device that allows people from two different places to communicate. The biggest thought in his heart at the moment is to expect this kind of thing to become a reality as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look, the lights have changed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fingin suddenly shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode looked at the Seagull, and saw that the yellow light hanging from the tail did not know when it turned into a bright red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but feel great! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red represents the attack signal. Once the track lights are red, they should immediately fly down the clouds and attack the enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the enemy, who is in charge of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s better to continue to circle in this labyrinth of clouds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode did not hesitate to press the joystick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white clouds suddenly enveloped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the vision was restored, Goode felt that the whole body was light, and the black and white earth and the gray sky seemed to be a great view. At the same time, there is also a horrible flying beast that does not notice the empty knights suddenly drilled from the clouds. They are less than three hundred meters from the ground. The target is obviously in the snow. The steam truck squad that dragged the long rim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their nose just in the direction of the enemy’s forward, this is an excellent angle of engagement, as long as the aircraft’s pitch is slightly controlled, the machine gun is fired. Bullets can run longitudinally through enemy formations. Moreover, the empty knights occupy an absolute advantage in height. After a round of sweeping, no matter how the fearful beast reacts, it is difficult to get rid of the follow-up pursuit of the biplane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just as perfect as a textbook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suffocation that was hidden in the clouds was swept away, and Goode controlled the plane to dive down and pressed the firing trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finkin sitting in the back seat gave a strange scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, there are more than a dozen silver streams in the sky, which are injected into the fearful herd at different angles and spread from the beginning to the tail. In the face of this sudden blow, the devil did not react at all. Several blood flowers bloomed from the air, and the madness and the beast that was hit fell to the ground like a stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment they realized that they were not the only hunters on this battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The herd exploded, some continued to move toward the team, and some turned around, seemingly planning to fight with the empty knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-six, Goode quickly pointed out the number of each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a sense, the number of the two sides is almost equal, except for the few patrolling beasts that were previously sporadic, this is the first large-scale air battle. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give Heinz an banner and let him follow us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled Shouted at the blind man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just 20 seconds, the Air Knights have passed the top of the fearful beast, and the first round ends with their victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the speed of the dive, Gude’s driving fire quickly completed the turnback, cutting from the side to a hard climb with a perfect arc. Behind the beast, the distance between the two sides is less than two hundred meters. He can even see that the madman is trying to turn around and try to find the most suitable angle for the spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he obviously won’t give this opportunity to the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squirting of the fire tongue - the bright and shining tracer flares like a meteor penetrates the back of the fearful beast. The sudden fall of the mount made its attempt to be a bubble. Even if it was not hit by a machine gun on the spot, it fell from this height and the result was no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
