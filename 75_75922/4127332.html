			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Curse?" Roland couldn't help but repeat it. The word is unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please come with me." Pasha turned and walked into a cave next to the main hall, where the stone walls were cut into even grooves. It is full of books and scrolls, and the number is even more than the collection in the temple. "Cyline, I’m down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know it," I haven't seen anyone yet, and Celine's voice has surfaced in everyone's mind. Then a tentacles fell from the bottom of the hole, and a pile of books smashed and smashed back into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that, the tentacles were also symbolic toward Roland’s bend, presumably indicating salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough--Sorry, she will forget me when she meets a new research subject." Pasha was a little embarrassed. "After all, very little A witch can be as lucky as lightning, with a curse but without fatal wounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She won't do anything about lightning?" The object, Roland will involuntarily think of the mice that have been manipulated into various poses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please rest assured that the main means of magic research is still observation and record, but with the help of the core, she can see each one more clearly. The flow of magic." Pasha said as she rolled up the books on the ground and spread them out to everyone. "Look here...and here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Roland noticed that most of these pages were yellowed, apparently from the ancient books of the Takira era, and in the position pointed out by the other party, in addition to the book recorded in the witch script, a translated note was attached. Undoubtedly for the purpose of reading and temporarily extracting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked carefully and found that it was a description of the two wars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a besieged city war, eight wounded witches were rescued by the reinforcements, and they should be able to save their lives, but eventually die one by one. Death The reason is that all treatments are ineffective, the wounds are unable to heal, leading to excessive blood loss and infection by evils. Before they died, they suffered terrible torture, so that the last two chose suicide." Slowly, "Because time is too long, the details of the battle have not been known, and the writer has only recorded this incredible scene. The devil's curse was first mentioned here."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Another time is close to the era we live in, a high-level demon called the Soul of the Confederation, in the Thousand Lakes and the Witches at the edge of the Fertile Plains. The fierce battle. This cruel monster can attach the magic to the black stone rifle. Once it is hit, it will make the body continue to decline until it turns into a dryness." Pasha paused, "before and after Three extraordinary witches die in it On the hand, the Quest found a strange magic in the wounded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has already concluded that "that magic comes from the enemy?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Pasha clicked on the tentacles. "So we speculate that these abilities may belong to the same type, and they will remain in the target and continue to Sexual destruction. It is not effective for conventional healing methods, and it is difficult to eliminate it by external force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is just like the curse," Wendy could not help but feel a little sad. "This is too horrible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale noticed the other party’s wording, "it is difficult to eliminate by external force, that is to say... there is still a way to Eliminate it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa then turned down one page, “provided we didn’t infer the wrong words.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland quickly swept through the last paragraph: Just as Thousand Lakes was in danger, a witch named Semanga stood up In the above extraordinary awakening a desperate stroke, and the cut in the sword Prodigy strange. As the high-level devil was split into two, she thought that she would survive on the footsteps of her companions, as if the curse had never existed. Because it was too close to the red fog area, Qianhu City still declared a fall after a year, but she has already won enough time for people to evacuate. After that, Semanga passed the extremely strong will, and the Federation passed the three-seat system and became one of the first three seats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
