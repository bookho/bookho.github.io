			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a slamming sound, the bolt bounces upwards, and the five-night scorpion glides out of the bracket by gravity, flying by the inertia toward the crowd. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the "Dongfeng", the bomb immediately recovered its weight, but the speed did not decrease at all. This change instantly gave it great kinetic energy. The friction between the body and the air caused a strange whistling sound, like a whistle, and the mountain wind passed through the cave. The people on the ground looked up and watched this incredible scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, most of the morning nobles breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two bombs are worthless compared to the huge body of the horror of the wheat scorpion - although it is thrown from that height, it will inevitably be bones on the head. There is no deposit, but the death is the three or four bad luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to get a piece of the church from the brink of collapse, the expedition responded to countless people. Large to the Duke guardian, small to the new knight, all actively prepared horses, recruiting followers, all the way to the morning of the Lord of the Hao Hao to advance to the west, so the team is also unprecedented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of more than 10,000 people, let alone die three or four, even if you die for thirty or forty? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a frightening beast that is even more fearful. Once you throw it into the crowd and bite it, you’ll have hundreds of casualties, not to mention those ignorance. The serfs were stunned and escaped by the madness. As long as the behemoths don't land, they are not too worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it is also possible that the other party is jealous and does not dare to openly confront the morning army. After all, this thing is probably the ghost of the witch, and in addition to the stone of the gods, they also prepared a lot of tools to deal with the witch - since the goal of looting is the church, this means must not be less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many knights have put down their longbows, put away the stone arrows, and laughed at the family of the two black stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without evacuation, no lying down, just in full view, the two bombs are like arrows from the strings, hitting a head in a nearly straight trajectory. Slowly moving in the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "stream" center suddenly set off two groups of scarlet flames! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humans and animals at the landing point of the projectile are directly turned into ashes, and the airflow that is heated and expanded forms an explosive wind, which blooms like a ripple in all directions. The hot air that accelerated to this extent was no different from the steel wall. The people who hit it almost immediately broke the bones, and the broken limbs and internal organs were thrown everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock wave decays very quickly, and there is no longer the ability to tear the body after a hundred steps, but for a bomb, its lethality is far more than in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the Battle of Wangdu, the area bordering the old holy city is a spacious plain, no matter whether it is a shock wave or a fragment, there will be no cover. The high-density people who are unprepared and stand up are the best targets for the fragmentation. The thousands of iron balls in the body, together with the broken shell, run through the crowd at several times the speed of the sound. Iron beads can often penetrate ten talents to stop, not to mention the huge steel shell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the bomb is released almost unreservedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sky, the black smoke is like a high wall, which will stop the surging "stream". <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the morning princes have not recovered from the thunderous blows, lightning has climbed to the highest point, and the second round of dive began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dongfeng, and then attack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜 followed, gathered wings, Along the path of lightning, all the way down, and screaming screams -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗷嗷嗷嗷嗷嗷"————!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight bombs are respectively loaded in the left and right brackets, and are sequentially dropped according to the slide rails. They can be bombed four times in succession or can be thrown into the same target in one breath. In order to achieve the best shock, Lightning intends to dive four times, as far as possible to keep the bomb in the back of the stream that has not yet been spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
