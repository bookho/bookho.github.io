			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know...this name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;岚 calmly said, "I Although born here, it does not mean that you know nothing about your world. I wonder if you have heard of the "consciousness"... or "the source of magic"? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland immediately thought of the news that Cabradaby had revealed. He couldn’t attend to clean up the pieces of porcelain on the ground and rushed to the table and looked at it. Asked, "She is in the consciousness world? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, but the conscious world remembers her - anyone who has gained enough power will leave traces there." "I paused." I know what you are thinking, you want to ask a specific method, and then try to solve the problem yourself. Even the attitude towards ending the war of divineness is no exception. But I must tell you that time is running out. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The conscious world is not a container for a long-lasting stay. The longer the time drags, the weaker her consciousness will be until it is completely dissipated." This process is irreversible, so even if you know the method, it is likely that it will not be implemented. And this is not the worst case. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the worst?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The existence of a dream world has seriously hampered the will of the gods, and it will not let this momentum develop." In other words, when the gods believe that all measures can't bring the status quo back on track, the two worlds will also be destroyed - this deadline is far more urgent than you think, which is why I am determined to convince you. "I said in a word, "Child, help me, is also helping you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds like this is the case," Roland said. "But you just said that only what I personally realized is that The real answer. In other words, what you told me may be a lie... including the resurrection of the ashes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;岚He took a sigh of relief and leaned back on the back of the chair. "You understand this, because I don't want you to think that I am until the end." Deceive you - putting it in front is also proof of my sincerity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is silent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, this is a dilemma.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the known information, he can’t find too many vulnerabilities in the other’s words—such as the threat of the dream world, he has heard from the magical creature more than once I have been there. Although I don’t know how to provoke them, the hostility shown by those monsters is real. If combined with the news, it means that the magic creature is the “man” of the gods.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but just thinking that the other party is telling the truth is too rash. After all, what kind of information will endanger the gods, and if you follow the mistakes The clues infer that the conclusion he got will undoubtedly be wrong and wrong. The safest method is to confirm it a little bit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem lies in time.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to judge the condition of "not much time", the choice is also the same Adventure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as I close my eyes, Tilly’s crying in his arms will reappear in her mind, even though she has now sorrowed all her heart to her heart. The pair of scorpions are missing a little more than the original appearance, just like the jewels are covered with shallow dust. It is often said that this is proof of maturity, only to experience the loss, only to know how to cherish. Roland This kind of soul chicken soup is scornful, never lose is the choice of mature people, as for the pain who loves to experience the experience.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now there is such a possibility, how can he do it? Not to be indifferent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland tried to suppress the violent volatility in his heart, pretending to be a slap in the face, and sat down again.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I can't promise you so easily. Let me talk about the method, what can I do to get her back to the world? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing does not conflict with the help I need, or the two are the same thing."岚 Slowly replied, “First you must find the conscious world and then enter it – and this step must be carried out simultaneously in both worlds, otherwise it is impossible to succeed. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
