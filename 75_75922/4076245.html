			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job," Roland waved his hand at the rippling shadows that entered the curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dark smile looms a smile, as if responding to his encouragement, if you don’t know that there is a witch hidden inside, see this The scene must be scared out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your enemy, the enemy is in the hall, the reaction is very strong, the magic level is close to the large mixed species of evil beasts," Falcon reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't worry, as long as it is not an enemy like a high-level devil, I and the spirit are enough to deal with," Felice said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So act as planned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the long porch, Roland found the villa The surrounding windows were covered with foam boards and tape, and the lights only lit up a few times, and the entire hall looked quite dim. The air-conditioning was very low, as if it had entered the winter from the early autumn when the heat was not scattered, and the air was filled with an old smell of corruption, which was disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man in a suit standing in the middle of the hall is motionless, apparently the goal of their trip. As soon as he entered the hall, Roland felt that the warmth of the body quickly expanded, and the feeling of pulsation was several times stronger than when he encountered a masked man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Farr caught a big fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he cares that the man’s face is facing a two-story wall with a huge monster statue hanging. The statue material looks like wood, and it looks like a dry leather. It has a human face, but it has a pair of wings. The thick hind legs and the slender front paws are curled up in front of each other. The shape of the monster is close to four meters, and the texture of the feathers and skin is vividly vivid, and its value is obviously high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bad taste of the rich, Roland secretly snorted, just to see the craft, this thing has at least more than a million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do it." He regained his gaze and focused his attention on the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a matte curtain to approach the distance of two meters behind the enemy, Felice took the lead in launching the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone claws sticking out from behind her back to the suit man with lightning speed, the interference of the magic made the curtain ripple, the other side is like What's up, I'm going back! But within this distance, even the extraordinary person could not escape. At the same time, the bone claws were cut from the neck of the man, the waist was cut out, and he was slanted into two sections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy's eyes widened and his face fell to the ground in disbelief. The dark red blood splashed on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that even if the natural core is not stripped, as long as the ontology is hit hard, the demon can't survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is over?" The spirit peeped out of the shadow of the sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next search is the focus," Roland snorted, not knowing if it was an illusion, and the rancid smell in the air was strong, " Remember how I taught you before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold jewellery, red pieces of paper, and iron boxes with discs!" Spiritual martial arts, "Coins are not worth the money, gems don't care!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, especially red paper, the more the better." According to him, he searched for Hermes According to the experience of the city, the price of gemstones is too large to float, and it is difficult to sell suitable second-hand prices, which is far less stable than gold. Of course, the best is still cash... He thought, I hope this guy is not an online shopping enthusiast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Roland squatted down and planned to transform the natural force embedded in the suit’s man’s belly, Farn suddenly frowned. “Wait... ...why does the magic reaction still exist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The other three were slightly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the voice fell, the statue suddenly opened its mouth and spit out a frog-like long tongue, stabbing straight toward Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Beware, Your Majesty!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice did not hesitate to stop in front of him, The two bone claws grabbed in the direction of the tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Roland has long been a thing of the past, he clearly captured the trajectory of the monster attack, grabbed Feili’s waist and rolled it to the side. , avoiding the long tongue shot like a sharp arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tongue of the monster directly penetrates the half of the body on the ground, then entangles the natural core, and slams it hard - the reddish core suddenly faces the big mouth of the statue Fly away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland noticed that the natural force that was already in a state of solidification was rotated again under the touch of a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the action of the monsters, a large group of insects flew out from behind them and fled in panic--obviously they were all attracted by the magic of the other side. But because of the inability to share vision, Falcon did not tell that the magical reaction in the hall came from two different goals! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha...what did I see, a group of martial arts homes sent to the door?" The statue swallowed the core and spoke, "You guys." This group of thieves who steal power should not exist in this sacred domain. Let me die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It raises its neck, like Taking a deep breath, and then squirting a scarlet breath to everyone in the hall -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the magic of the mortal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the furniture in the hall was torn to the ground, and the matte curtain was also broken up by this wave of attacks, hiding the gracious and Farn There were a few blood marks on his body, and he fell heavily on the ground. Fortunately, in the midst of a thousand miles, the two escaped from the most violent central area of ​​the magic, and they were not as fragmented as furniture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s state is much better. When the magic hits, the warmth of his body spreads to the whole body and protects him like an armor. Key parts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what is the attack method? His heart is full of horror, and the witch's ability is completely different, directly turning the magic into the energy of the damage. This kind of attack is almost unprecedented - since he has the strange power, he is more familiar with the magical atmosphere. This attack is by no means what the demon can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the look of the witches is also particularly surprising, which means that the monsters have a higher level of understanding of the magic than they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's the magic reaction...close to the high-level devil!" Farr gnawed his teeth. "How is this possible?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil? Do you call my generation like this?" The monster sneered at it, it easily pulled off the rivets that held the wings, leaped from the wall, and squatted like a gargoyle. In front of everyone, "Without permission, you steal power from the domain of God. You now call the pursuer a devil? It's just stupid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God? Chaser? Roland couldn't help but frown. What exactly is it referring to? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a black light jumped out of the shadow behind the monster and flew over its cheek - that is the figure of the spirit! With a bang, a short knife was inserted from the eye of the monster, sticking out from the other side, and piercing its head. After the spirit succeeded, there was no pause, and the moment of landing fell into the shadow again. The whole sneak attack process was like a flowing stream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job!" Felice clenched her fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful?" However, the monster did not fall like a demon, its woody face cracked, and the dry voice seemed cold and ruthless. "On the basis of this little iron and the attached magic, I also want to hurt me? You don't know what the gods mean! Now let you see the real power of the master."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After speaking, a series of cracking sounds one after another, the crack quickly expanded from its face to the whole body, and then the dull outer shell turned into pieces of debris, peeling off from it. Under the wooden shell, a dark red glow blooms, like a bloody scarlet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
