From now on - point 515 fans festival to enjoy double monthly tickets, other activities have to send red envelopes can also see a look! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The firewood is burning, but Gordon Wimbledon doesn’t feel much heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is already a large tent made of cowhide stitching, the bottom of the circle is also pressed with soil, and there is no place for air leakage, but he still feels Cold, especially the toes, are freezing and losing consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This damn place, can urinate with ice," he vomited, stood up, clasped both sides of the table with both hands, and lifted it hard. On the back of the hand, the blue veins suddenly burst, and a six-foot square solid wood table left the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden a lot of comfort when putting the table to the side of the fire pit. He took off his shoes, baked his feet on the fire, and spread the paper in his hand, continuing to write unfinished letters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To dear Lifia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already arrived in Hermes For more than a month, of course, the church guys prefer to call this a new holy city. If it weren’t for the evil moon convention, I wouldn’t want to stay here for a moment, just want to go back to your hut and share the warm bed with you. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The blessing of the Convention, the army that monitors the church's every move has become an ally to support them. This is a kind of irony, isn't it? Speaking of the church I have to admit that everything they did is really amazing. I remember when I first came here, or twenty years ago, Hermes had nothing but mountains and stones. At the foot of the mountain. But now, they not only open up the road for the carriage to go up the mountain, but also build a large fortress city on the top of the mountain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the summer, you should really come and see with me, the new holy city in their mouth is more majestic than the gray castle. Remember the gray fort. Do you have a theater? I have seen the Prince Revenge with you. You lamented how ingenious the theater is, and the interior is so spacious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you see the performance of the new holy city, you will find that the Grey Fort Theatre is nothing. It is a building, I think it is more like a wonderful piece of art. The large space, but not supported by a stone pillar. The outer wall protrudes from the bones of the giant beast. There are many branches and hemp ropes between the curved animal bones. The whole roof is suspended in the air, just like a boom. The same. How did they come up with it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And those bones, if they are stripped from the evil beast, I bet that the guy must have exceeded One hundred feet. Probably only in Hermes can you encounter such a monster. But dear, please don't worry, even if the evil beast is huge, it is just the minion's minions. In front of the stone of the gods, any Evil can't escape God's sanctions, be it evil beasts, women , Or the devil itself, are only the fate of wiped out. "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;. Wrote here, Gaulon Wimbledon put down his pen, shook some hands tingling. Strange to say, holding a fifteen-pound two-handed sword can be used for a whole day, and when I grab the pen to write such a word, I feel tired. He laughs at himself, and I am still suitable for doing some rough work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking of the evil beast, I suddenly remembered that my fourth brother was assigned to the poor place in Bianbu Town, I was afraid that I had escaped with a tail." The song fortress is there - although the evil beast there can't be compared with the Hermes defense. This can't blame him, even if I go to that place, I only have refuge. So I can see how my father is. Unfair, just because the younger brother was extraordinarily clever, he decided to let him inherit the throne. The father forgot that he did not win the gray castle throne by cleverness. Since my mother died, I have become more and more difficult to find out. Thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next content made Goron hesitate. He didn’t know if he should tell Livya what he was going to do. After a pause, he still Decided to write it down. If the plan goes well, he should have arrived at the Grey Castle Palace when the letter was delivered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear, Aung, is right. If I don't do anything, the throne will definitely not belong to me. He has observed this from the astrology." One point. "Apocalypse stars are far away from the blazing sun. At most four months, they will completely leave the track of the sun." "The bachelor told me this, obviously, there is not much time left, I can't wait any longer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
