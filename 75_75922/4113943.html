"If it is for today’s recruitment order, then you don’t have to persuade us. It won't change your mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Achima..." Doris couldn't help but whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She raised her hand and stopped the other’s words. "In the past two months, you have taken care of us, I remember it, but the two are not one. Things - as the first time there was no winter city, since the church has been destroyed, I will leave the West sooner or later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compared with this, I am more I want to say a good news first," Wendy's soft look did not change. "The City Hall received reports, and a large number of people from the East will arrive in the Winter City after a week, with a population of 12,000. And this time they are likely to have your loved ones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living room suddenly boils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... are you telling the truth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, in order to pick up When they came back, the shipping department was full of strength," Wendy said with a smile. "The Chishui River is full of cement boats heading east, not only filled with dry materials, but also prepared for cold materials. After all, It’s already autumn.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I used to live in the town of Arch Bridge, and there are people in the town in the immigrants?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to Jinsuicheng?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Affirmation is a mess."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I hope that my family is not inside...I was the father who drove me out of the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was also The church is tempted, maybe you can't regret it now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, there are 12,000 people," Wendy clap, "almost covering most towns from Jinsuicheng to Haifeng County, wanting It’s hard to find a fellow countryman. When the book is finished, you can immediately screen out the people who are related to your identity. Even if this batch doesn’t, it doesn’t matter. The migration is just the beginning, and there will be more and more. People come to no winter, as long as they stay here, there will always be a day to meet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she looked at the witch who looked tangled, "if It’s fine to be unwilling to recognize, but I think there is always better news than no news, isn’t it, white pear? At least when they regret it, they can give them a chance to remedy.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking...also," the girl, known as the white pear, bowed her head a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really want to move the entire east to no winter?" Akima surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than the East," Wendy laughed. "The North, South, and Central Kingdoms are also within the migration plan. These territories will only be retained. There are several big cities, and the residents of the towns and villages will gather in the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why... is it necessary for King Majesty to do so?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This explanation is very complicated. It seems to be called...the process of urbanization is coming. It is said that because of food problems, it is necessary to provide a large area of ​​cultivated land to support a city. Therefore, the population is very scattered. But now food is no longer a problem, and those who occupy the vast majority of the villages and towns are in an administrative gap and cannot be effectively organized and utilized. Therefore, they are closer to the city and are more conducive to the city hall. Power.” Wendy patiently replied, “Because of this, the West is no longer the Western Region in the past. If you leave, what should your partner do? Let them leave their loved ones. With you, go to the deserted hometown stream ? It "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" ...... "A Qima frowned, and sometimes did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just plain, but it’s weak." Just then, another cold voice rang from behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
