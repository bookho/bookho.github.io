			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland gave himself a cup of tea and then looked at the nightingale, "You either ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leans on the lounge chair and holds the fish in one hand Dry, holding a copy of Mei's new script in one hand, I can see it with gusto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Anna talked to her, the nightingale disappeared for two days, and when she appeared again in front of Roland, she seemed to have unloaded the burden and changed back to Previously free to look like. There is always a smile that can't be concealed on his face, and occasionally he will sneak a few eyes on him, his eyes full of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like she is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unscrupulously put your feet on the coffee table, the robes smashed to the side, revealing the slender legs wrapped in black stockings, only when someone came in Will temporarily hide the figure. This tempting posture made Roland's eyes often involuntarily sideways, causing half a morning to pass, and even a pair of drawings have not been drawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew that I wouldn’t call Soroya to draw this kind of warm socks that are close to nylon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will bring another cup of tea that is pleasantly fragrant to the nightingale, "The tea you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put down the script, took it with both hands, sniffed hard, "Ah... good fragrance, can you help me add a piece of sugar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the afterlife, the nightingale is undoubtedly a middle-sex person of the salty and sweet parties, and how can they not eat fat. During the time when Roland was awake, she lost weight very seriously, and she lost weight in her body, but when she woke up, she quickly returned to normal level, and the weight seemed to have an upper limit. After the standard, it will never grow again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Roland would have to eat too many sentences to get too fat, now the other party does not need to worry about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put a piece of sugar into her cup, he went back to the table and drew a few more, and finally couldn’t help but curiosity, said, "Night... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anna she...what did you say to you?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." She flashed and appeared on the desk steadily. "It’s a secret."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't I even tell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was Anna’s request," the nightingale hesitated, and finally shook his head, "if It’s about me, you want to know what I will say, but this... she keeps me secret.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey, okay,” Roland After drinking a cup of tea, I didn't continue to ask. Although he can go directly to Anna, but people with normal emotional intelligence will not repeatedly mention this matter at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least he can see that Anna is not angry at this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when he mentioned the quill again, the nightingale suddenly said, "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Roland groaned and looked up, just in time with her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qiuyang dyed her golden length, and left a bright spot on her face. The moving face is as beautiful as the picture in the warm sun. Time seems to stop as a result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for telling her my wish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the afternoon, the Ministry of Construction sent good news. According to Roland’s new drawings of steelmaking facilities, the first converter steel plant fell at the foot of the North Slope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s a factory that looks more like a simple iron shed, with a new piece of equipment on a large scale – and before The difference between all the kiln is that the smelting equipment is cast from steel, the angular rack and the large converter have been coated with a heat-resistant coating. The matt surface of the gray-black is given in the sun. People have a heavy feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
