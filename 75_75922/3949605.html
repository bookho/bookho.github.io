			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the butler has not left the boundaries of the Celtic family, Roland has received a bird biography from the Second Army of the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, Pei’s letter of assistance also arrived at the town’s castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the limited information carried by the flight messenger, he linked the contents of the two notes to confirm a surprising news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four homes in the West are reversed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who gives them confidence and dares to rebel under their own eyes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland immediately recruited Carter and the Iron Axe and took the note in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, this is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"News from the fortress," he Quite annoyed. The winter is nearing the end, and after three days, it is the New Year. There are many things to do in the city. The three-way equipment in the town also needs his guidance to complete. At this time, I will find trouble for myself. This group of nobles really don’t know how to write the dead words. What! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the secret letter report, first the city’s nobility led a group of gangs from the assault on the defending city soldiers, and when the members patrolling the wall found something wrong, the Beichengmen Suspension Bridge The landing and landing organs have fallen into the control of the nobility. They had to ignite the campfire and rely on the wall to stay in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other members of the Second Army who observed the bonfire signal, according to the emergency response charter, divided the ten groups in the camp, about 50 people into two teams, one The team headed for the North Gate and a team rushed to the Fortress Castle. Pei's secret letter was issued after the second team exchanged fire with the enemy in the castle area. It was only then that they realized that the enemy they encountered was a local aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Peer Hermon mentioned that the attackers who besieged the castle held the flags of the four major families, and they were definitely premeditated about the rebellion." Carter frowned after reading the note. "And it can make this bunch of sands clumped together, and the nobles should have a new backbone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, The four major families...or the five people under the Duke of Ryan are all equal grand aristocrats, allowing them to lay down their stereotypes and cooperate with each other. Ten ** is a greater force that has stirred into this drowning, otherwise It depends on the strength of several counts who do not accept anyone. It will not necessarily have a result for more than a decade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, there is still a leisurely intervention in the West, and only one or two may be left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean...the king of Tifoco?" The iron axe looked to the chief knight, as the Mojin sandman, he was against the gray fort The political situation is far less sensitive than Carter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are a church, I am not surprised," Roland pouted. "From what they did in the Dragon Ridge, it can be seen that the West is not enough. It’s a matter of time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The problem is... The second letter mentions that there appears to be a firearm in the enemy’s ranks,” Carter frowned. “They Already know the formula of gunpowder?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Snow powder is no secret to the church and Tefco, but it is still very long to be flexible. There is a long way to go," the prince tapped on the table. "I am just surprised. Even if they have the support of the forces behind them, they can't save the near fire. The nearest one to the fortress is Bentham Town. Where are they confident? Can you fight against the First Army fighters?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably because of the demon moon," Iron Axe thought for a moment and replied, "Last time you used The Thunder defeated the Duke’s Knights, but did not show extraordinary ability to attack the city. Now the road is closed by heavy snow. There is also a beast attack on the upper border. For them, it is the best guarantee for the success of the rebellion - you must have at least two months to attack the long song fortress."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then was blocked by towering walls and muskets?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," the iron axe couldn’t help but scream, "You own The weapons they possess, plus the unattainable walls, and even the reinforcements behind the forces, can't beat you to the foot of the wall – I think they think so.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
