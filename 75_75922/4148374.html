			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first explosion was heard, the team in which Trent was located followed the instructions and sneaked out of the hiding place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I haven’t ran a few steps, and there’s another loud noise from the north! The sound of the sound even provoked the dust on the ruins, and the violent shaking of the ground caused everyone to fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;裘 稳 稳 稳 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Constantly rising, like a fist to the sky. Around the flame, the red mist was illuminated, as if the sky was burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand people showed a frightened look in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound... I’m afraid I can describe it with the wrath of the Three Gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be afraid!" Minda bit his teeth and shouted his arms. "That is the means by which the great chiefs came out to deal with the enemy! It’s those devils!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words made everyone come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this is the skyfire that the Great Chiefs have lowered!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not stop, Keep moving forward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stagnation of the squad is running again, the walls are cracked, the windows are open, the corners of the collapsed houses are constantly coming out, and they are coming in again. In the offensive team. Soon, this inconspicuous flow of people quickly became a wave that could not be ignored, rushing straight toward the city of Tooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;裘达 ran in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has long been convinced by the Grand Chief, he always believes that the Shamin is more suitable for fighting than the North, especially as he is born in a barren oasis, from urinating and dying. The small clan of the struggle. Not only the bow and arrow scimitar, but also the same as a musket. After accepting Brian's training, he even developed a unique skill, not only fixed target shooting, but also a good shooting rate in running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now is no doubt the moment to prove yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He not only has to rush into the city for the first time, but also to get the first result of the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to let this Mo Jin name ring the whole army! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the troops followed the gentle slope all the way up and just saw the walls of the city of fangs, a daunting heat wave swept across – there was For a moment, Minda almost thought that he had returned to the extreme south, and it was still the top of the sand dunes in the midsummer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot air roasts the skin, making it difficult for him to open his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people behind are not much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole team seems to have collided on an invisible wall, and the speed of advancement has slowed down. Even some of the rushing Northers ran back. Squatting down the ramp, it seems that doing so can avoid this sudden burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;裘达强走走了十十步, and more and more feel that something is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball that has risen into the air has been extinguished, leaving only one circle of smoke that is still spreading. The original red fog is missing here, as if it were Only the giant beast squatted down. The surrounding fog did not fill up immediately, but formed a large curved blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the open gate, he saw the ground in the city as if the heat waves were tumbling, and the outlines of the buildings were distorted, especially the wooden houses that were blasted The seven-eighth black-and-white column is like a claw that protrudes from the ground. The enemy did not rush to stop them, nor did they panic and escape - in fact, he did not find any traces of the devil. At the same time, Tatsu felt that her chest was out of breath, and the heat flow around him made him afraid to open his mouth and breathe, and his body continued to move forward. Every step is as heavy as a mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
