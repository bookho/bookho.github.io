			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...a dream? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland blinked and walked step by step to the fence, overlooking the panoramic view of the school under the setting sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one on the empty playground, the solitary goal frame drags long shadows in the orange red afterglow, and the familiar library and dormitory in the distance On the floor, a row of brightly lit windows was sunk by the sun that fell into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has studied and lived here for nearly seven years, and he is familiar with everything, and the place where he is now is undoubtedly the top floor of the teaching building - - It is also the place where he often goes when he is free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has too many memories here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the iron gate behind the warm air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This iron gate is a unique landscape on the top of the building, and its appearance is as old as an archaeological excavation from the ground. When he came to this school, the iron gate was already ruined. As soon as he pushed it, he would scream intermittently, as if he couldn’t breathe, so the time after opening and closing the iron gate always seemed particularly quiet. Roland always thought that it would soon fall completely, but until the day he graduated, the iron gate was still quietly on the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since it’s a dream, why are you still looking like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down at the slender hands and touched the gray of his shoulders. Obviously, this height and shape are inconsistent with the self-indulgence of learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about it... What happened before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland frowned for a moment, only to remember that the last shot was the nightingale pushing him away, then a flash of light, then her panicked and desperate face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A female voice that turned to ethereal suddenly sounded on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was shocked and turned his head too hard to see a white fluttering woman coming out of the staircase, she had a pair of ruby ​​eyes The red and white robes fall straight to the ground, and the horns show a delicate golden pattern, which obviously does not belong to this era, and the gold crown on her head has revealed her identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the church's...pure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also Hermes The fifteenth pope of the city," she paused. "My name is Jieluo, and you definitely don't call Roland Wimbledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Roland couldn't help but frown. "So this place was created by you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything makes sense, and the light should be the ability of this guy, so Nightingale will take away with yourself, and the scene in front of you should be the effect of fantasy or virtual space. When he opened his eyes, he thought he was going back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although knowing that the predecessor of the church is likely to be the federation, but the Pope is also a pure person - the same witch, these people actually change their own kind It’s hard to understand a monster that is inhuman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it was what you created," Jielu stepped over and the tone was full of interest. "It is the most influential place in your memory. Most of the time it will appear in the land of everyday life... but I am very curious, where is it here? The four princes of the Grey Fortress are absolutely impossible to live in such a place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should I tell you?" Roland carefully moved toward the railing and kept her distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you going to do now to get rid of the illusion? His mind turned sharply and jumped from the top of the building? According to his experience of nightmares, just looking for a high point to jump down, you can wake up from your dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter if you don't tell me," she smiled, her voice very sweet. "With a little effort, I can understand it sooner or later, including you." Who, where did you come from, why did you become the four princes of the Grey Fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
