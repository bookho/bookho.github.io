			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, he felt that both hands had caught himself at the same time, and the sound of vigilant nightingale rang again. "What happened?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The illusion generated by this imprint directly affects the eyes," the person who explained is Ai Gesha. "On the surface, everyone seems to have disappeared, actually It will not affect the reality, we are still in the original position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't want to watch it, you can directly exit the scope of the mark. "Isabella added a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn’t take long for the black screen to fade away, revealing a transparent glass dome, marble floors and a spacious conference round table. Then there was the witch wearing the robes of the federation, and the star-studded queen with a long red hair was in it. It was clearly four hundred years apart, and everyone’s image was vivid, even the cups on the table were hot. As if the moment in history has already been fixed, it is now again in general. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there were such things in the past life, those historians who stared at the soil and turned over and searched for only one or two pieces with written fragments would be moved to cry. Come on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that there is no danger, one hand let go of him, and the other not only did not loosen, but fell down, and his five fingers tightly Buckle together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland immediately understood who the other party was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his mouth, pinched his soft hands and moved his eyes to the center of the illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The activation order of Isabella is obviously near and far, and the location shown in the illusion has also changed from the escape road to Takira, and then from the tower Pull to the falling star city. In addition to the age of Akalis getting smaller and smaller, the witches who appeared in the game changed one after another, and even a few familiar faces were hard to see – no doubt in this long-lasting brutal war, the federation suffered There are very few high-level losses that can survive to the eve of the flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a flaw in the witch empire’s own system. The higher the status of the powerful abilities, the sounds seem to be fine, but when the war broke out, these tops were personally On the battlefield to meet the enemy, instead of sitting behind the town to command the overall situation. Roland once heard that Ai Gesha said that Akaris was advanced in an extremely dangerous battle, and such a battle has experienced many times in her life. In other words, as long as you are not careful, the history of the federation...and even the entire human race has to be rewritten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital of the three seats is so, let alone other top management? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is very unfavorable for cultivating leaders - a new soldier can become a battle, a few mouthfuls of blood can be turned into Veterans, a general who needs several battles and thousands of deaths can really mature. Leading the charge is indeed the best way to boost morale, but that is also the choice to consider when you have to. If all goes well, even if you don't have to boost morale, the soldiers will still fight with high morale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals and the soldiers are not equivalent - in the face of a full-scale war that needs to treat people as consumables, this is not desirable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland does not expect to find any secrets from the seal, the pope should refer to the contents of these illusions repeatedly, if there is a record of the origin of the gods, or The essence of the relics of the gods, the church will not fall to the present. The purpose of his trip is to satisfy the curiosity. The rest is based on history and see if you can give yourself a little experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual situation is similar to his thoughts. Most of the pictures recorded in the picture are the scenes of major conferences, ceremonies, and mobilization of war. Only in this case It is worthwhile to use the magic stone seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Ai Gesha, the signatures that can maintain the effect for a long time are worth a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusion quickly played to the last one - whether it was Akaris or the other two seats, they lost their traces from the image, instead they were dressed in a variety of dresses. The older witch in costume, and the picture is not as clear as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha snorted softly, "These people are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
