			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the dream process Roland has become familiar with it, as long as you think about the dream world before closing your eyes Unique things can “trigger” the light column that goes straight to the sky, and then he will naturally wake up and welcome another morning in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time there was a small accident, he didn’t wake up naturally, but was awakened by a string of phone rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this kind of sleep is not really falling asleep, and there is no feeling of being stuck. Roland climbs up and picks up the phone from the bedside table and finds it. Actually it is Garcia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you know what time it is now-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"6:30, and It’s not too early,” the phone interrupted. “And how do I know if you will have relatives suddenly coming to visit?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but pump The corner of the mouth, it seems that the last time she put her pigeons still let the other person remember, "Hey... something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't always want to know what is going on. The association has set a time for the new beginners to visit, just this afternoon. After breakfast, you will come to 0827."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it not afternoon? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Newcomers are not just one of you, it takes time to rush to meet other people in the district," Garcia's voice raised a point, "Why, you Today, I want to take my relatives out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is more than one. Of course, he knows that if he answers this question, the other party will definitely block the door. In addition, he is indeed curious about the "erosion" in the mouth of Garcia. "Okay, but I slept a bit late yesterday, so... you know I may have a bit of a taste. Let me take a shower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." She was silent, even though the microphone was across, Roland could feel the opposite The sigh of excitement came, and finally Garcia slammed the phone after "please hurry". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the next step is to hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland puts on clothes and walks into the living room, Jielu is busy in the kitchen--she concentrates on the eggs and the shovel in her hand is very different. Looking at this action, it is almost impossible to ignore that she is just a junior high school student. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning," he said hello. "I will go out first and come back soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo reveals a suspicious expression, "Uncle, are you going to morning exercise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh it is..." He said casually, "right Yes, the company has a staff meeting in the afternoon, I may have to come back later, you don't have to wait for me to eat together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know it," the little girl whispered . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the building, the community has been buzzing, the rice noodle shop on the side of the street is fluttering with white air, and the breakfast stall is with a pot The fritters sizzle. Even though they have entered the late autumn season, people are dressed a lot thicker, but there are still many older morning runners around the building. They are wearing short sleeves and sports trousers, and are making rapid progress in the rumors of broadcasts and vendors. The hands and feet are not much slower than the young guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland turned into an alley not far from the building and parked in front of a shop that had not yet opened. The rental notice posted on the pavement was quite eye-catching, but before the word was rented, it was artificially painted with a big "已". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the key and opened the side door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the house, the more than 20 witches standing in the same place kneel down to him at the same time, sing in unison, "See your Majesty!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, he seems to have returned to the Winter City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a wall apart, but it’s like a world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
