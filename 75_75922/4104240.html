			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it really okay?" Wendy pointed to the ordinary people on the dock and lowered his voice. "I mean, spend money to hire people." Come to the line to welcome, instead of really welcoming the sleeping island witches... If they are known by them, I am afraid that they will be uncomfortable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you can Find out a group of residents who consciously welcome witches?" The book also whispers back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...no." Wendy hesitated, and finally shook her head. In fact, don't talk about a group, even finding one or two is difficult. It is true that under the rule of Roland, the acceptance of witches by the people of the Winter City has been greatly improved. Individual witches have even received special attention and love, but the migrants of the Sleeping Island are no different to strangers. It is almost impossible to get the people to let go of their work and take the initiative to meet a group of people they have never seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the people in the West can do this, except for the squatting of Roland, only the first army of relatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So there’s nothing wrong with this arrangement," the book shrugged. "The big red flower, the welcome banner, the family welcome team - these expenses are pre-calculated. In the funds for the event, do you have to let other departments take it? If you follow the first idea, the scale is much larger than this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, this is not wrong..." Wendy touched the sweat that didn't exist on her forehead. After hearing from the audience of Sir Tiley, the news that the sleeping island witch was about to leave, her majesty was excited for many days. In addition to those mentioned in the book, what honor guards, song and dance troupes, fireworks shows... It sounds very good to welcome the project to be listed on the memo. If it is not Hill Fox’s intelligence plan, the plan will be implemented in advance. The welcoming ceremony hosted by you will be very spectacular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, recruiting with money is the most appropriate approach," the book smiled. "The average person still can’t take them, they can come. You can rest assured that the town hall records a good family." She gave her a little bit, "The witches came over and went to see them, my league manager."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Books!" Wendy smacked the other side, then nodded to the side of the house of Terry, and walked away with the guests coming from afar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello!" As the two groups met, she opened her arms and smiled with the softest voice. "I am the head of the Witch Alliance."蒂, welcome to the winter city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the agreement, sleeping on the island Witches are only counted as Westerners and are not managed by the Alliance. Therefore, Wendy is ready to bring them to the residential community and make a simple demographic so that the City Hall can allocate food. As for the subsequent visit arrangements and work plans, she plans to wait for everyone to settle down and discuss the decision with Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community built for the Sleeping Island has been built two months ago. The name follows the name of the bounty guild, which is called the Sleeping Curse. The location is right next to the Miracle Building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this magnificent building that has been built up to the sixth floor, there are a series of exclamations in the witch team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the unique cleanness of the concrete building surface makes it easy to feel its extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would it really be a stone? Why does it look so flat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't Will you live here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't think about it, this is the castle of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can live to the top, the scenery will be beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing everyone's curiosity, Wendy took the opportunity to introduce, "Now the building has just been built in half. When it is all completed, it will eventually reach 55 meters - that is, the height of sixteen feet is still five feet. But Roland can not live here, his castle is only The third floor is located in the center of no winter city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So high... are you afraid of collapse?" Someone was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
