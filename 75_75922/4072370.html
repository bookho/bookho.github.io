			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a long dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Luojia knows the dream of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment when the four-winged eagle fell to the ground, the body has deeply remembered the reaction and pain of that moment, the legs were broken, and the bone head was a stone grinding turntable. The grain underneath - although she has not planted wheat, she has seen how the tribes deal with this kind of food purchased from the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, don’t say it’s a fight, she can’t do it in the second half of her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, she is still standing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only in a dream can you reverse reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia took a deep breath and looked forward. At the foot is a sand road that can't be seen at the end. Every time I walk, I can meet an opponent. Yes, the opponent she has defeated in her life is now coming to her. No ridicule, no sarcasm, they passed by her one by one, and then disappeared into the yellow sand with no end behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is a sand worm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the result of her first hunting at the age of twelve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it sneaks in the sand, it will leave a clear trajectory, and this time is the easiest time to kill it and kill it once it is quiet. When it comes down, it is difficult to find its location. However, in fact, the sand people are the most cunning hunters in the desert. She disguised herself as a bush. When the sand worm approached, she pierced the hot sand with a spear and directly pierced her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This record is more than her brother and sister, even in the Tieshan City clan, it is extremely excellent. It was this hunting that made her like the joy of confrontation and fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the sandworm did not sneak into the ground, but carried his head, like a snake, slowly slipping over the sand. For a moment, Luo Jia even thought that it would spray a bite of acid to herself, and she would be corrupted beyond recognition. But nothing happened in the end, it just passed her quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next is the drug lord and the desert wolf... her second and third opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former left her, but the latter stopped. The Desert Wolf hesitated for a moment and then walked to her side, sniffing her bare feet, then turned and walked side by side with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia remembered it, it was a cruel challenge - Mo Jin women wanted to be a qualified duelist, and they worked harder than Men are much bigger. After hunting a lot of sand worms and poisonous cockroaches, she put her gaze on the wolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the group of wolves is far more terrible than she expected. A sandstorm rushed the team, and when the storm subsided, the dense wolves appeared on the horizon. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounded sand people fought back, but they still couldn’t stand the claws and fangs that came from all directions. The tribes fell one by one. She thought she would be buried here, but did not expect that at the last moment, a tearful pain occupied her, and then she became a goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge incomparable wolf king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stands in the yellow sand stained with blood, overlooking the wolves, wherever the sights go, the wolves are all lodging, just like to dominate their fate The gods bowed to the general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the awakening, this road suddenly became a lot more spacious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same age of the leader, the clan martial arts, the warriors who have fought in battle...They came face by face, disappeared one by one, and Luo Jia’s heart gradually Tightening up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps when the last opponent passes by her, the dream is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much time left to walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for the earth to become dark, and it seemed that something was going over her head. Luo Jia looked up and saw the figure of the four-winged eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last moment is here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the desert wolf around him made a roar, his body shape swelled and rushed toward the sky overlord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two giant beasts slammed together, and the blood and feathers splattered. It seemed that they wanted to finish the duel that had not yet been won on the burning platform. general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia held his breath and stared at his own battle of the end of the battle - every time she fights, her body will faithfully record all feelings, this is her The growth rate is much faster than the average person. If she plays with this monster again, she firmly believes that she can persist for a long time, even if she does not wait for the ashes to intervene, she can bite the other's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, she can't wait for this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle quickly entered the heat, and Luo Jia wanted to rush to fight alongside the giant wolf, but found that the body was completely unable to move, and even his feet began to lose consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She realized that the dream was to wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fear caught her heart and made her tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, she doesn’t want to spend the rest of her life in bed like a waste! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to stand up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; want to continue fighting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the feeling of imprisonment is getting stronger and stronger, and it has spread from the legs to the neck, and it is impossible to move even the lower neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the belly of the Desert Wolf was opened by the olecranon, and suddenly a sigh was heard - it dragged the intestines two steps, unable to stand toward Luojia The direction of the fall, even if she lost the ability to fight back, she still used her broad back to cover her all the next attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sniper is like tapping in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No----! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia suddenly opened his eyes and sat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the sand road and the behemoth disappeared without a trace, and the maid’s exclamation sounded. “Princess adults...you wake up "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes... she snorted for a while and woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time she finally stood up...and so on, Luo Jia couldn’t help but see her, the maid saw the panic rushing to the bed and wiping The cold sweat that popped up on her body. The top of the old tent, the swordsmen hanging on the wall, and the burning brazier are all unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can one do this with one eye alone? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She subconsciously reached out and touched her left eye, and the touch was intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it’s not just the eyes, the two arms are the same, there is no soreness on the body, even the feet...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia slammed the quilt, turned over from the bed, and stood firmly on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." She looked at the maid who was scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The group of northerners brought a new goddess and cured all your wounds," the maid stuttered, "she even The herbs are useless, and your wounds will heal again with your hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no witch in the Grey Fort, there is a witch called Nana She has the ability to heal any injury, even if she has only one breath, or her hands and feet are broken, she can also restore the injury to the original."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
