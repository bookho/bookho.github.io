			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Da’s words are not false words, and this is by no means a human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Weien can’t imagine how the Grey Fortress will deal with these miracles - except for looking up, what they can do, I’m afraid Prayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil will surely win this war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no doubts now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous loss and fear have been swept away, replaced by indescribable excitement, since the devil can win the war, then the reward for him is no longer The illusory thing, this contrast is far from being able to save the people who are drowning, but to ushered in the peak from the road! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for those knights who have escaped, I am afraid that I will regret my life for the rest of my life - no, no, they will not have the qualification to live to the end, and wait for themselves to become the winter. The queen will surely make the betrayers look good! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Weien stunned half-heartedly and bowed his head to Heckzod. "Yes, we have seen it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other nobles have also done it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the god of God's creation, and the most direct way to express "power." "The Lord of Scorpio carries both hands," "Take you here not only to dispel doubts, but I have tasks to give you to complete." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please tell me! "Everyone is busy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It takes a while for the god of God to reach the desolate mountains, but the territory you manage is already out of control, every fugitive They may turn into enemies of the ethnic group in turn, and I do not want to let this situation continue to deteriorate. "It scans the crowd. "From today on, you must organize people and transfer everyone in the city." At the same time, I will also draw an area on the god of God for you to live until the end of the battle of God. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... want those people to be on the miracle?" "Nanos was surprised.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who do you think this is wrong?" Heckzod glanced at him coldly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter immediately closed his mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The Cavaliers' escape message will not be long before it will reach the lower level, when the order of the winter will completely collapse. Instead of letting them use it for the Grey Fort, it is better to control them before the snowballs roll out. If there are opponents, use a knife and a sword to shut them up. This is not a difficult thing for you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When, of course. Ma Weien said the first way, "I will do it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other nobles have also promised in succession.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, your territory is not It will be abandoned because the war will not last that long. Heikzod seems to see their worries. "In addition, following the actions of the gods created by God also means that you participated in the war. This will greatly increase the weight of your merits. When the human kingdom is distributed, it will obviously not be ignored." Do you understand what I mean? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles suddenly fell in love with their hearts. The failure of the previous sneak attack on the Grey Fort squad has undoubtedly failed to satisfy the devil. Now there is an opportunity to make up for it, and maybe even Further, everyone's emotions are mobilized.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, yes! We will definitely do our best! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod opened a new portal, "just understand." I only have two requirements, the faster the transfer, the better, and the fact that the god of God is not revealed. Then, act now. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Yongdong nobles were sent away, it returned to the Great Rift Valley <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the "low-energy bugs" in the eyes of most of the tribes come into contact with the gods of God, Heckzod has suffered a lot of pressure, at least in the Majesty It’s not a piece of iron. The mask even thinks it’s a kind of embarrassment, but it’s still forced to be carried out as “West Line Commander”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the efficiency of the other party in transforming war soldiers far exceeds the past experience of the ethnic group – even the symbiosis that the mask is proud of can't achieve such an amazing speed of transformation. Therefore, the Grey Fortress will be crazy to search for the population from the winter and the wolf heart, because it is not a burden, nor is it intended for the long-term, but the real short-term benefits! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the order maintained by the nobility collapses, it will be given to the enemy a large number of fighters. This is something Heqzod definitely does not want to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, this group of people is no worse than the inferior in terms of work. It’s a pity to kill them all. It’s better to move to the god of God. For the ethnic group. Under this circumstance, this decision can be said to be the most reasonable choice at present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, other similar recognitions are not recognized, it is not something that can be considered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What God made, what holy place, no victory is important. It has already made a fortune for the Western Front war, not only made a vow on the king's side, but even God-made gods applied for it. This kind of criticism and accusation is nothing more than a new debt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the pressure on the upper level, the problem of Heckod’s headache is even worse in the city of Scorpio. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the stone steps slowly descended to the bottom of the birth tower, in the thick liquid pool like a liquid, there is a dark figure. It sits across the nightmare, holding the palm of the other hand in motion, like a stone sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven't given up yet?" Heckzod frowned in dissatisfaction. "If I can find its whereabouts through the clues of the conscious world, I have long been like this." Did it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't know what kind of mold it is, why every colleague is so unreliable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is the silence that has come to reinforce the Western Front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the name is, it is mostly wearing a set of impenetrable armor, rarely revealing the truth, and basically does not open, no one Know what it really thinks in his head. But unlike Maharaja and other Maharajas, its individual strength is the leader of the Maharaja, and the Lord of Scorpio is not too harsh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you switch to another guy, it’s just a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, I finally hoped to come to the reinforcements. As soon as I arrived in Tianzhu City, I did not ask about the situation and did not understand the enemy’s situation. Instead, I went straight to the Dianchi Lake and accompanied me. The nightmare's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that once lost in the conscious world, it is no longer possible to return to the original point. There are ocean currents and sun stars on the sea as instructions. There is nothing in the consciousness circle. There is always chaos and disorder. The torrent of the lower layer is like a storm. It is even difficult to maintain itself, and it will continue to be eroded by other consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightmare has been lost for a few months now, even if it can be recovered, it must not be the "it" before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It must have discovered any clues before taking this risk." The silent disaster replied in a rare way, "Where it is about Wakiris, I have to verify it myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously the other party does not trust it very much, Heckzod reluctantly licked his forehead, although the nightmare for other Maharaja It is a very special existence, but it is more special for some people - one of them is the silence. If it is not mistaken, the other party's promotion ceremony is passed under the auspices of the nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now are you confirmed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost, but the conclusion is not the same as you. "It is concise and succinct," I think that the nightmare is not completely lost, but is trapped somewhere by the consciousness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Intuition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, intuition. Heckzod's abdomen, if there is anything more unreliable than the promise of a false face, it is probably the instinct of silence. "Does this conclusion help the results? You can't find the trail of nightmares, and you can't wake it up. You can't change anything at the end. Instead of spending time here, think about how to deal with humans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
