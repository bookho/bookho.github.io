			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon moon has been in the past two weeks, and the snow has flowed into the Chishui River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the white tulle fades, the woods on both sides of the strait are again sprouting, and now it has become green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land outside the townâ€™s east end was baked by Anna and was temporarily designated as the driving range for the first army of Bianyan Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field, Carter Lannis holds the knife sleeve and twists twice to check if the bayonet is securely installed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another new thing invented by His Royal Highness, but it is a modified black powder that can be operated automatically and a modified snow powder that can be ignited by ignition. It can be too simple. As soon as he holds it in his hand, Carter knows that it is not a qualified weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Essentially, it is just a sharp triangular piece of iron, folded slightly against the centerline. Although it is edged, it is impossible to use it to slash the target - the sides of the blade after bending are extremely short, the front end is almost no, the back end is only the thumb nail width, even if there is no enemy of the armor, cross the past Maybe even the clothes can't be cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This weapon has only one purpose, that is, it is a sniper, and it must be connected to the musket before it can be used. It is held in the hand alone. It is even worse than a dagger. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wasting a large pile of pig iron, creating a weapon with only a single attack, in the eyes of the chief knight, is naturally an unqualified work. If a blacksmith in his territory dares to do this, he will bind the man and slap it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if it is such a poor weapon, he can also see the unique details of His Royal Highness, such as the card slot design of the casing. Two right angles, as long as the small iron bars on the barrel are inserted, and then turn a half turn, the bayonet can be fixed on the barrel. This shaped tongue makes the sleeve and the barrel do not need to fit very well. The too loose sleeve can be inserted into some pieces of paper and then rotated. If not, the leaves can be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Upper bayonet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear the password, the members of the firearms who are assigned to the bayonet have come from Pulling the blade in the bayonet bag across the waist and putting on the barrel - the new weapon and the matching knife pocket are currently producing more than forty. The unsold ones have to be replaced by short wooden poles like the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This set of exercises has been practiced for almost one morning, and now most people only need two to three time to fix the bayonet. According to His Highness, this is the hard work of the last minute. He does not want to see the subordinates enter the white-blade battle. Carter did not agree with this statement. He did not personally put the sword into the enemy, but he still only counted a young child. Only when they see the blood can they turn from miners and hunters to warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe is also in the ranks, although he claims to be a hunter, but Carter can see from the other hand, this person is absolutely specialized combat training, skills No worse than the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Highness asked Carter to teach the soldiers to practice the assassination, he had a dim sum, and the bayonet had never been heard, in case he would never use it. What should I do. But after seeing the prototype, he immediately became full of confidence. This is not the same as a short gun, and because of the particularity of the blade, it is much easier to use than a long gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only single benefit of the bayonet attack is that it is easy to train, without squatting, smashing, blocking, sweeping, only one action, stab. The chief knight lets all the players line up in a few lines, teaching them the most suitable spur action for the force--the legs stand back and forth, bend over and bend their knees, and the two arms do their best to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This repeated training is extremely boring, and what makes Carter amazed is that everyone finishes the spur action meticulously, and before they change to winter, they still A bunch of weak and lazy civilians are now acting like a decent. Shouting out the passwords will be carried out immediately, and they will even be more careful than training them. Of course, give them a sword, which is the "cold weapon" in the mouth of the temple. These people still can't walk three tricks under their own hands. But from the perspective of the will, their progress is worth a high look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After half an hour of practice, Carter let the firearms sit down and take a break. At this time, the prince of the prince also appeared on the driving range, and he was followed by a woman wearing a hood. It is no surprise to the Cavaliers that His Highness has already greeted him in advance, and today's practice will be carried out by witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
