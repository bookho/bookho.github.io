			<div id="content">At the same time, Goode also received a telegram from the second team captain. "Here is Manfred. Goode seniors, then I want to rush out." Clouds, I hope you can help me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Out of the clouds, you are crazy? Here is the enemy's base camp!" Waiting for Goode, communication The sound of Finkin has been heard in the device. "And you also heard that there is a barrier protection above the foggy sea. What can you do? Newcomers, the battlefield is not a place to joke you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the most advanced and improved biplane, the Sky Rage radio is standard, which is why the ten planes dare to travel through the clouds without Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode did not directly refuse, he was more curious than the other generation’s intentions, “I heard your request, Manfred But even if you can see the target, you should be aware that there is very little chance of hitting without the calibration of Sylvia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early training At that time, he noticed this talented student - it is said that the other is a lonely knight, because the wolf can not go to the gray castle. The empty knights of many civilians often lived in front of him in front of him, in order to vent their dissatisfaction that had been oppressed by the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Goode doesn’t have any affection for the Wolf Knights. They seem to be arrogant and can’t be alive, but when they encounter a real strong enemy, they often run. It’s faster than anyone else – he has seen countless times when the Hermes Church has misappropriated the wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And like Manfred, the knight who actively seeks war, Goode still sees it for the first time, so he wants to know if the other party is deliberately in Tilly. Show yourself in front of the temple, or really different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Predecessors, do you remember the way we used the fuselage to control the bullet trajectory when we fired?" Manfred replied, "I think it's against the bomb." It should work as well!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, the humming sound over there suddenly seemed to be a little empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy has already flown out of the clouds!" said Fingin, "What should we do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the fuselage to control the bombing... Goode quickly realized the commonalities. He coughed twice. "You can't leave the two groups, no matter what, Your Royal Highness can look at it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Ah, haha, no. Wrong!" Fingin paused for a moment, and soon changed to a sigh of sorrow. "Protect teammates, but what I am best at, you can go with confidence, the group of fearful beasts will be handed over to a group, Yeha- ———!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really easy to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode sighed and pushed the joystick forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two groups of formations jumped out of the clouds from different positions, swooping down, drawing two thin traces on the dome, and the beasts that climbed up Formed a countercurrent trend. Compared with the large number of the latter, although the number of the sky wrath is small, it has given rise to the momentum of the stock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of turns crossed an arc, colliding with the beasts, and the two groups went straight to the obelisk - within this distance, Even without the guidance of Hilley, they can directly confirm the target with the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the road, although some of the devils tried to intercept the five wrath, the speed gap was reflected at this moment, and the climbing beast had just turned into the plane. He was rubbed over the biplane and squatted behind him. As long as they do not take the initiative to enter the air battle, even the sky wrath with a hundred and fifty kilograms of bombs will not be able to catch up with the beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After adjusting the direction several times, Manfred dropped the bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teammates who followed were following suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hook-off bomb maintains a speed and path similar to the plane, crossing the dense tower and high wall, and plunging into the foggy lake area - compared to the high altitude In the case of bombs, the five rounds of the bombs were quite concentrated. Except for one blocked by the obelisk, the remaining four rounds were directly detonated over the foggy lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job, newcomer." Fingin whistled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gude turned to get rid of the fear of the beast and switched to all channels, "Reporting His Royal Highness, one or two groups have completed the bombing mission, request to return!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understanding, allowing returning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Phoenix quickly shot a red signal flare. The fleet that was fighting with the devil began to climb to the heights, and with the dazzling sunlight, they disappeared into the blue sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mask gave a sigh of satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These humans are more and more unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers are divided into two ways, the main force is attacking, one strike away, without delay... From the defense force to the interception to the end of the battle, but only two or three moments bell. Such a flexible operational plan undoubtedly maximizes the advantages of those war machines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that Ursuk was jealous of human beings, and it seems that he did blame it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even the genius of the ethnic group, only saw the threat, but did not find the essence of mystery - conversely, even clumsy and slow human Can all walk down the sky with the help of the Iron Bird. Isn't it even more amazing when using the words of the tribe? At that time, the Tianhai world will no longer be an enemy that is difficult to deal with, and the ethnic group will be invincible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Ursuk used to convince everyone for this reason, it might stand on the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to the tremor just now?" The door at the top of the tower was opened, and the silence of the armor was slowly coming out. "The god of God made Did you attack?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but you came late, didn't catch this wonderful battle." Nasopele smashed it At a glance, "Is it that you want to play like this? Or don't be too reluctant to be yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to." Silent whisper, " Where are the enemies?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasperelle pointed to the sky, "They probably have discovered that the gap between the Ironbird and the Bogle Wings has become The most obvious breakthrough between the two sides. It is ironic... In the second battle of the gods, this hard-won no-magic body is still the biggest capital for my family to win."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silently looking at the sky without a word, the face is quite ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry," Nasopelle put the mask back on his face. "After this observation, I have thought of the way to deal with it - compared to the wing Beasts, their action trajectory is too obvious. Right, since you are so eager to fight, it may be a good help for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so serious, I didn't laugh at you." The mask spread out a lot of arms. "There were several iron birds that fell to the southeast of the city. The bugs above are still alive, just grab them over - I think this little thing should not be difficult for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must be alive ?? Silently asked a cold voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Nasopelle laughed smugly. "The fresh head has the value of transplanting. Moreover, they have just experienced fierce battles. The flight impression is the most vivid, and it is my effective tool to verify the countermeasures - this is the first time I have a common worm's mind. I don't know which lucky one can win this honor?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silently disgusted to open your eyes and turned to the birth tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasopelle turned back unwillingly, knowing that the other party would not like this practice any more, for the ethnic group will do its best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mask looks at the human territory in the distance and slowly stretches out the palm of the hand - from this perspective, it can be used with only one hand The whole continent is in the palm of your hand. At most a few days, the god of God can enter the land of the Hermes Plateau. The tens of thousands of symbiosis in the test site are ready to go, and it is necessary for the king to see that he can pass by himself. An army, whether bloody or silent, is nothing but its set off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
