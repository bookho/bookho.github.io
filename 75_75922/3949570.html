			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are looking for the right person," hooded and grinned, his voice hoarse, making it difficult to tell the exact age of 21? Seeing that I lived in the outer city, I happened to be near the palace on the day of the incident. When the roar sounded, I ran outside the gate of the palace wall. You probably don’t know how amazing the loud noise is, if the thunder in the sky is on the ground. The blooms are no different. The windows of the surrounding houses—whether paper or glass—are destroyed by invisible forces, and others are scared by the noise...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every mouse claims to be in the vicinity, and witnessed the whole process of the matter, but one comparison will reveal that everyone's statement is different. "Well, stop licking these meaningless things. How did it happen?" Otto Rossi interrupted. "Is this incident really related to the Four Princes... Roland Wimbledon? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hood coughed twice and extended his right hand. "Of course I can tell you, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The need to measure everything," Otto untied his pocket, "How much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called measure of everything, but the Golden Dragon Don't call it, only the group of mice, like to set some simple secrets or passwords to show off mystery, there is no level at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party has a second gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out two golden dragons and put them in the hood. "This is not a low cost. I hope your news can be worthy of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, this is related to the credibility of the fingers," the other party showed a greedy smile, and Jin Long into his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The credibility of the mouse is probably as ridiculous as the benevolence of the king, and Otto’s heart snorted, “Let’s say.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will answer your first question first," probably the reward, and the hooded posture is also relaxed. He licked the ale, leaned back on the chair, and then pointed Refers to the ceiling, "Thunder comes from heaven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean," Otto frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not asking how the loud noise happened?" The other party lowered his voice. "All the thunder are from heaven, and this time is no exception. I am." I witnessed it, before the roar of the roar, a white stone floated into the palace, and then there was something happening next."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is absurd! Do you want to tell me that a huge stone fell in the sky and the palace was smashed in the majority?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what I said is true, otherwise my fingers are also I won't assign this to me. If you feel like I'm talking nonsense, you can leave now." The hood shrugged. "But the fee will not be refunded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "... continue to say." Otto was not pleased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The stone from the appearance to the fall into the palace, only counts the time, but I saw it very clearly, the thing is not big, the speed is not fast It’s probably not possible to want to see the temple, so I will call it "floating." In addition, while the loud noise and smoke appeared, I also saw the tumbling fire, the sound is compelling, definitely not caused by the impact. "The hood whispered. "In fact, the last search by Tiefko did not confirm this. - The closed inner city was cleaned up several times, and no suspects were caught, plus the Royal Palace area itself was on alert. Strict, if the attack is not from heaven, where can it come from? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drank the ale again. "As for the fire and the smoke, it is like the phenomenon of burning an alchemy item called snow powder. This is why I am convinced that it is an attack. By the way, I know something about the snow powder, but you have to pay for it, just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I don't want to know. Otto interrupted. This thing he heard from other sources, originally a celebration supplies, can be used as a weapon after improvement, and the mouse is unlikely to know its specific ingredients, he does not need to waste money here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, answer your second question now. "The hood does not care about the hand," "There is no doubt about this matter - there is a great relationship with the Four Princes." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
