			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is designing the medal pattern for the award ceremony tomorrow. It is reasonable to say that this work, which is not particularly important, should have been completed long ago, but from the afternoon he will I have been somewhat restless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly, after kissing him from the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there was some hunch in the past, but the other party did not clarify, he was not good to take the initiative, but now it is certain, how should he respond to the other’s feelings? it is good? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of the nightingale also made him understand that he did not hate the nightingale, and even was somewhat complacent. A woman who is beautiful, moving, and calm, and who is still with her, will she hate it? Roland was unable to respond positively to the inherent ideas that have been formed over the past 20 years, the real problems that will be faced in the future, and... Anna’s ideas. Especially at the last point, he can't ignore Anna and only act according to his own preferences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps these answers can only be given to the time to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the door knocked outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in, no lock." Roland shouted, and at the same time some accidents, who will come to the office at this time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is Anna, who saw her holding a two-disc plate in one hand and a crock in her hand. Roland has already smelled the seductive fragrance before she opened her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Anna smiled and placed the plate at the table. Then take off the bowl covered in the crock and pour out the milky white soup. "This is called honey-roasted mushrooms. One dish is made by me. One dish is made by nightingale, and the mushroom in the jar is used. It's a common seasoning of vanilla leaves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks delicious," Roland licked his lips. "You also sit down and eat together." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny nodded and sat down across the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Night, why didn't she come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She said...don't know What expression should I use when you are," she replied. "I don't quite understand why she cares about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." So, Roland I sighed softly in my heart. Although I said that I was righteous and unrepentant, I still said nothing, "This is not your fault, I just did what I want to do." Actually, it is better than courage to explore the hole. The squirrel is not much better. Really, is this daring or timid? "If that's the case, let's eat it first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick up a piece of mushroom and put it in your mouth, The sweetness of honey melts in his mouth, followed by the juice contained in the mushroom. In the age when there is no MSG, this rich and delicious feeling is enough to make people scream... and some salt grains enhance its freshness. Finally, it is the chewing taste of the mushroom itself, delicate and tough, and the taste is impeccable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These...not ordinary mushrooms?" Roland immediately discovered its distinctiveness after swallowing, and generally kept the mushroom cool after the barbecue. It’s not bad, how can you bring your own juice? It is not soup cooked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it’s a specialty of the fascinating forest. People in the town call it a bird and a mushroom.” Anna smiled and said the origin of the mushroom. "Because of this, I want you to try it too.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has tasted a mushroom for soup, which is also very delicious, contains the juice It is a lot richer, it feels like eating a soup bag, and it feels more crispy when chewed. This long-lost taste makes him think of a very common and suitable dish for any later generation. Seasoning - MSG. Before the discovery of sodium glutamate, the chefs can only use indirect ways to enhance the taste of the dish, such as whole chicken, bones, mushrooms and soybeans. Although the cooks of later generations I like to express my exquisite cooking with original flavor, but I have to say that even if it is a lame newbie, if you add MSG, you can make the taste of the food more than one level.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bird's mushroom is born to be plump and juicy, Jane MSG is the ideal material to squeeze grows on trees, it is difficult to pick, so it did not get people this is not a problem for Roland <br <br /> & nbsp />;.?. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
