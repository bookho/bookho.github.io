			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, in the castle garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An older sister..." Nana Walla took Laana's cuffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?" The latter turned his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you feel that the night sister... she is a little weird."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weird "Anse snorted. "Are you talking about her clothes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale stood beside Roland, she didn’t wear the set that she never saw. The weird pattern robes, but like myself, wearing the weird costume invented by His Royal Highness Prince. Although Anna does not want to admit it, but the tall figure of the other side reflects the advantages of this set of clothes - well-proportioned legs, slender waist, and long curly hair. With a cloak and a pointed hat, anyone will focus on her first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not clothes," Nanawa muttered. "You don't think that she talks with the prince's Highness, and looks at the prince's eyes. Have you become different from before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... "Nanawa snorted. "Okay, Anna, don't blame me for not reminding you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inexplicably, Anna shook her head, not going I will pay attention to her, but focus on the other two new witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name is lightning, looks like Nana Wa, the size is very different. Anna roughly counted, and she had at least twelve pockets on her rag-like coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the other witch Wendy, she did not wear the same pattern robes as the nightingale, but ordinary women’s casual wear. But a little bit makes Anna particularly concerned, that is the other's chest... it is too grand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you all agree to sign the contract, then we will come to the first training," Roland has the training experience of the first two witches, now it is More than enough, "Lightning, you come first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Lightning raised his hand and walked out of the shed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a little snow outside, no wind, the little girl floated easily to the air, waiting for Roland’s next order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try your fastest flight speed first!" Roland looked up and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, look at me," she gave a thumbs up, made a starting position, and then quickly turned around the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland visually measured the speed, about 60 to 80 kilometers per hour, which is based on his own experience of running back to his hometown every year. In terms of flying alone, this speed is not too fast, similar to ordinary pigeons. But it is more exaggerated to hear that she can fly with the nightingale and Wendy on her way home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the concept of taking off 100 kilograms? A piston machine with a hundred kilograms of bombs appeared in Roland's mind...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the next experiment broke his wonderful fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the load exceeds 50 kilograms (about 110 pounds), the flying height of the lightning drops sharply, from the previous hundred meters to a steep ten meters. After putting in a load of nearly one hundred pounds, she can only fly two meters to the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if you want to make the lightning avatar bomber, even if it is a few A kilogram of explosives, she will also enter the opponent's strong range because of height problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Roland soon thought of the new use of the little girl - whether it was a detective or a shelling, she was a great candidate. The encirclement plan that has been plaguing myself before now seems to have touched a glimmer of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the prince tested the ability to lightning, Wendy looked at him quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
