			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the recent days have been very pleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of the Morning has not recovered for a long time, and the prince of the Prince seems to have left him behind, but the nobles did not ignore his ambassador from a neighboring country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attending a lavish banquet, and playing with Denise, even under her introduction, enter and exit some high-end clubs and brothels that need to be introduced, and taste the kingdom of the kingdom. The richness and unique charm are all not available in the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the title of "Wambuton's royal ambassador" hanging on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the ambassador is equivalent to the count, in a sense it is better than the count - after all, the latter can only do what he wants in his own fief The former can enjoy the courtesy of the upper class in other kingdoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is deeply aware of the benefits of status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the guardian Hill Fox, who is hand-picked, is also a magical figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter who he is dealing with, the other party will sneak into the bedroom on the night after two or three days, and will marry him with his identity, status and interests. . If it is a big man, even the preferences can be explored. With the help of Hill, Joel was even more like a fish in the aristocratic circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under the arrangement of the other party, the purchase of slaves has also made great progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making Dennis comfortable and talking in the ear, the businesswoman immediately agreed with his suggestion - using the existing business The team opened up a road to redemption slaves: buy the refugees needed under the Wimbledon from other slave traders and then transport them to the Grey Fort. The precondition is that slaves must be given the status of free people, rather than treating them as goods and then reselling them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the businessman is not a businessman, even when he is full of emotions, he does not forget to talk about the price. She can not charge the purchase price difference, but the shipping fee cannot be saved. The manpower, food, horses and other expenses add up, and then count the profits, and finally get the price of one person to collect ten silver wolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting Hill’s natural sip, and slap his chest, saying that even if it’s expensive, you can’t let these talented people fall into the slave’s realm. . This statement undoubtedly deepened Dennis's goodwill, and the two returned to the bed and enthusiasm for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Joel sent Hill to discuss the matter in detail, he would no longer have to deal with these trivial businesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that the twenty-five slaves purchased in the first batch yesterday have already followed the caravan, so he can still get the 125 promised. Silver Wolf extra bonus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can collect money in bed, is there a better position than this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambassador is awesome! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was wondering where to go today, a servant knocked on the door and came in. "Hello, the eldest son of the Losi family, Otto, wants to I want to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto Locy? He is no stranger to this surname, and one of the three major families of the morning king, the power is second only to the royal family of Moya. Denise also warned him specifically, which woman is good to hook up, don't go to the three big families - especially the Quine family, or the ambassador's identity can't protect him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I don’t have to worry about this now. He has always been very cautious about this kind of problem. The purpose of the other party’s visit should be to invite himself to the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please ask him to come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man walks into the study, first looking around After some, I took the initiative to close the windows before I sat down on the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His look is a little anxious, his eyes are black, apparently late last night, almost no sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About this kind of leisurely behavior, Joel is not very agreeable. In his opinion, the temperate joy can make both men and women feel cheerful. Good health is a beneficial behavior. The energy spent all night, just in the potential of overdrafting the body, the Prince of Anpein is a typical example, even his face is pale, so I am afraid that by the age of 30 I will not be able to find happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
