			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in the next few days has changed so fast that it exceeds everyone’s expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Wangdu never thought that they would see such a scene: the Quin family who served the royal family of Moya for hundreds of years, openly stood in Ampein Mo The opposite of Asia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a conspiracy of secret planning, nor a cosmic force that civilians simply cannot reach. Everything is on the table – the former prime minister of Glow City Standing directly in front of everyone, publicly preaching his ideals and purposes, in simple terms is to overthrow the rule of the incompetent tyrant, but also a bright future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the speech, the count gave examples of the decline of the city and the stupid tyranny of the new king for more than a year, and used accurate data to describe the dawn of the dawn. result. Since no aristocrats had told the people about the operation principle and insider of the territory, and the speaker was the former prime minister who had been with the king for more than ten years, the act did not unexpectedly cause a sensation. From the auction house of the Chamber of Commerce to the Black Street Tavern, almost no one talked about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said how many hundred people died in the slums in the last winter, which was caused by the reduction of cultivated land in the outer city."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, there is more to die outside. It doesn't matter if you take the land to expand the palace, but what does the Earl said that the grain is gradually reduced?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder the recent food prices are indeed much higher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that the farmers in the suburbs have been forced to fight. Now it is good, The army has lost a mess, and few people who have been taken away can come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that food price going up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I hope that this month will not be hungry on our heads."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, you want to support Quinn Piaget? He promised that if the goal can be achieved, Huiguang City will no longer have to worry about food issues, and everyone can fill their stomachs in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hello, I didn’t say that. "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; imperial prime minister's speech will be by such a discussion, quickly spread throughout the city glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If quite a large number of people are skeptical about the content of the promotion and attract them to continue to pay attention to the matter, it is the conflict itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big aristocratic family is in a tit-for-tat with the Moya royal family. How many times can this kind of grand occasion be seen in life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the people, they can only hear from the pubs that they have been rumored or boasted about how many times they have been modified or exaggerated. The feelings in these days are simply Too exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a performance of drama, but a real rebellion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anpein was not indifferent, and the two sides had several positive battles, but they all ended up with the failure of the royal family. The power of Count Quinn is beyond the imagination of all, and a powerful and incredible guard has become his solid shield – not only in the case of a huge number of people, but also the team that has fallen into the army, the number of their own instead More and more, from the first dozen people to the current forty or fifty people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s even more exciting is that the count has unabashedly announced his plan: he will move the striker to the castle area five hundred steps a day until dawn. The Lord gave up the throne, handed over the crown, or was driven off the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, for up to five days or so, this confrontation will be a winner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呯!""砰!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anpein smashed everything on the desk to the carpet until the exquisite room became a mess. Even so, it can not alleviate the anger in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, damn! When did I cut down the cultivated land in the outer city? Isn't that the problem that the father asked him to investigate? Still dare to ruin the suburban villages and towns. The reason is strange to me, it is clearly a good thing for Roland Wimbledon!" He almost snarled and said, "It is his witch who killed those people, not me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really should have put them all in the prison at the beginning. Ampe thought because of hatefulness. "How many people are I still available?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the palace The knights, guards, and mercenaries still have 1,500 people. If the maids and servants are mobilized, they can add another two thousand.” The chief knight replied, “There is a stone wall outside the castle area. For the guards, you don't need much training to kill the enemy. Although the wall is not as thick as the main wall, there is no problem with the people standing there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Originally it was his playing cards against other lords - especially the Royal Palace Guards. Almost every one had the ability to fight the quasi-knight, and the equipment was exceptionally good. He began to train them before his father had passed away. Only now, he has to put them into the palace defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remove the boxes in the vault and tell the servants that as long as you kill a monster, you will receive a reward of one hundred golden dragons!" Grit your teeth, "If you can defeat the other party's rebellion, I will give him the title and the cover! There is a plus!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disciples of the church are not invulnerable. This has been confirmed by the pure people. Even if the monsters are infinite, it is impossible to remove the entire stone wall by hand. Right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the more and more, it is just the horror of Count Quinn, he must have arranged the thugs early, and then pretend to be the illusion of his growing momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No aristocrats would believe that such a fierce warrior could be found everywhere in the Glow City until today. The stupid civilians don’t even believe in it, and their ideas have little effect on the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hawford's old guy got support from other nobles?" Anpein looked at the minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter's face is a bit ugly, "Hey, this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was a rumor that "black money" began to contact the Earl of Quinn, but the specific situation is still unknown -"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This group of pervasive locusts! "Anpein clenched his fist. "My father also used their underground kennel as part of the market. I want to see it. It is really time to copy their homes!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also knows that this sentence is just a venting of anger. The organizers of "black money" are the giants of Huiguang City. Their status is not sub- In the great aristocracy; and a large part of the wealth accumulated in the Moya family treasury comes from the pockets of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, Tokat's family has been publicly and Quin's family has come together," the minister swallowed. "But please don't worry too much, I heard The Losey family rejected the invitation of Horford Quin on several occasions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the three families that the father is proud of...Anpein The bottom of my heart sneered, and now the two become anti-thieves, the action is faster than those who look at the little aristocracy, and the last reason why they dare not move, just because Otto Losey is still in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this may be a weapon for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Send someone to tell Earl Rossi that if he wants to prove his innocence, he will immediately come to support the palace with the knights and crickets in the territory." Cold voice, "otherwise... I will not be merciful to the heirs of the treason family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will do it!" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two hours, the Lord of the Morning Received the news that Earl Rossi was willing to be loyal, which made his anger a little calmer than the sky. The bad news, he finally pulled the situation back to his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anpein doesn’t care much about the Knights of the Losey family. The most important thing is that he knows that the younger generation of the three people are brothers and sisters. If you know that you will be ruined with the king. One of them will be the same, will they still be in line with the pace of the family's power? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is undoubtedly a stinger that is hard to remove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
