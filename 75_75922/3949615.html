			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, Roland gave a speech in the theater of the Long Song Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this propaganda, he told Pei in advance to inform the people of the city about the details of the rebellion, and also specifically asked Mai Hao to make a special trip from Bianbu Town. echo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day, the crowd gathered in the theater was less than he had imagined. Even though it was spring, the snow fluttering outside blocked the people’s thoughts of going out. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the Second Army and their families were all present in full, and it seems that they have made a contribution to the "death soldiers who have rich compensation" in the notice. As for other people, you can slowly fight for it in the future. Roland believes that the best publicity comes from people’s word of mouth. As long as seeds are buried in the hearts of these people, it will affect more people sooner or later. He insisted on building the cause of the people's army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are sharp edges, they are iron walls, and they are also role models for propaganda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My people, good morning. I am the Western Lord, Roland Wimbledon, I believe most of you have heard of my name," Roland Looking around the people, "First of all, I mourn the casualties caused by this turmoil. This is a conspiracy from the kingdom. In order to intervene in the Western Order, Tiefko provoked war three times and five times, and it is a pity that The four major families in the West have not only stood on the side of the people, but have acted as the opponents of the other side, which eventually led to this tragedy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince did not tell too much Regarding the content of the insurgency, people prefer to explore these "secrets" in the pub than they preached, so they simply opened their heads and he transferred the topic to the compensation that everyone cares more about. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the turmoil, out of the 112 soldiers of the Second Army of the Western Front, 56 people were killed, and the mobs arbitrarily looted in the residential areas. Twelve houses were burned and forty-eight civilians were killed." Roland said, "I apologize to the people who have been to the long-song fortress... As a guardian, I have not fulfilled my responsibilities. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince’s words caused a stir in the masses. Obviously no one has ever heard that the royal family will apologize to the people. Many people feel a bit shocked. Wrong, but in the eyes of Roland, this is only the attitude that should be the master of a place. He does not have the unreasonable pride and self-respect of the nobles. If the people are not in the eyes, the people will not really support the people who lead them. This has been repeatedly proved by history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promise that everyone's blood will not flow in vain! The fallen soldiers will not only get thick burial, but their families will also receive five Golden Dragon pensions. And every month, you can also get a grain and charcoal as an additional compensation to the City Hall! This standard is exactly the same as the First Army of the Western Front, and I hereby promise that the newcomers to the Second Army will also be able to obtain The same treatment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few cheers. Obviously, most of the fortress people are skeptical about these rich compensation. After all, the deduction and the greed have occurred from time to time. Even winter relief foods can be blended with sand and leaves, not to mention Golden Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Roland has already thought about how to deal with it. Since it is propaganda, it is natural to make "topicality" the best. He claps his hands, and Pei Luo, the iron axe and two first soldiers carrying the boxes have stepped onto the stage from behind the scenes. "At this moment, I have a list of dead people in my hands. Now I am trained by the governor of Changge Fortress. Luo Hermon personally put the pension in your hands!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the soldiers poured all the golden coins in the box on the table, people reacted Only became eager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second Army, Firearms Camp, Aya!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Second Army , the firearms camp, the iron column!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe slowly The names on the list, the family members went to the stage one by one, excitedly took over the Golden Dragon, and they were both squatting and bowing. The scene was a bit confusing. Roland even felt that the nightingale had put his hand on his waist. Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good to chaos, eventually nothing happened, when the pension was not easy to issue, the time is close to noon. Roland waved his arm and pressed the theater There is noisy discussion in the world. "And those who are homeless because of the war, can also get a shelter from the wind and full rations until the end of the demon moon, there will be someone to give you. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
