			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like the law, which is extremely repulsive and not like a pill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seeing that the spirit of the other party is really good, I don’t think about it any more – it’s hard to keep yourself on the battlefield, let alone worry. Other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is still on the eighth day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before eight days ago, their defense was still outside the Windsor Castle, and the cross-attack of machine guns and artillery made the devil difficult. But as time went by, there were enemies in all directions. The huge skeleton began to be inserted directly between Fengxuebao and Jinshiling, turning the weakened area into a red fog area. The empty knights tried to block them, but the effect was not great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the devil relied on these "fortress-type beasts" to unfold from the two wings, the artillery attack was dispersed. In order to avoid the army being surrounded, they slammed one side. Retreat to the subsequent positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is to repeat the process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy’s attack is as long as the tide, everyone feels tremendous pressure, and the rest time is reduced from normal rotation to four or five hours, even though There have been several reinforcements, but the gap in numbers has reached a level of clarity. The number of soldiers on the front line will not exceed 2,000, and the devils will basically charge more than 20,000. The fearful beast directly bypasses the line of defense and goes straight to the direction of the cage. Although it is impossible to understand the situation there, it is obvious that the rear is not a stable place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just three days ago, the frontline troops received all orders to withdraw into the city. At the same time, the Devil's offensive on the west side has suddenly increased a lot. This is undoubtedly a signal: Jinshiling, located in the west of the First Army, may have fallen. Now it is their turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day, the enemy broke through the line of fire for the first time and had a close combat with the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, this battle has completely become a contest between the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tingda turned its attention to the broken wall that was hundreds of meters away. Today, the outer wall of this whirlwind is already riddled with holes. Filled with the body of the devil, the blood that was thrown made the wall stained with a strange blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance from the low wall to the line of defense is more like purgatory. Soldiers and madmen are mixed together, half buried in snow, half in the cold wind, like a sculpture formed naturally. Because the enemy's attack is endless, they don't even have time to contain the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are bone spears and stone needles on both sides of the long street, like the barbs that grow out of the earth - because not everyone can hide in the fortifications In the meantime, every time the rain drops in the sky, it is a lucky draw for the soldiers hidden in the houses and the ditch. One of them penetrated the wall of the room and landed less than one meter away from him. If he is a little more biased, he has already served the Three Gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Minda shook his head and threw these unlucky thoughts out of his mind. When the clan was in crisis, he could not get any prayers to the Three Gods. In response, this time is naturally not from the blessing of the Three Gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe he will eventually die in this strange city, but before that, he must let the enemy pay a painful price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Chief promised that he would never be ill-treated to every clan that fought for the fate of mankind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the purpose of his coming here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are coming!" French reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no artillery sound...The artillery position was completely misfiring last night. Some people said that it was a sneak attack by a beast. Some people said that the artillery had already transferred in advance. But no matter what, they can only resist the enemy on their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil's figure finally appeared on the wall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first to fire is still the machine gun team - in addition to the fortress gun, the high-pitched and continuous sound of the machine gun is the most pleasant voice in the hearts of the soldiers. The flying bullets caused the snow beside the wall to splash, and the first devil that passed over the wall was instantly knocked down, and the same kind of person behind him was turned over by the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the first army has long had no fixed line of defense. The troops are grouped and scattered around the bunker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important task of them is to prevent the devil from sneaking close to the permanent fortifications, and the enemy far away from hundreds of meters, even if he wants to start, it is difficult to be accurate. Hit the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, five or six madmen appeared above the roof of a two-story earth building, and they seemed to be planning to use the house to bypass the most densely populated areas, and this One act made it completely exposed to the guns of Tida. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held his breath and pointed the trigger at the end of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal is down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falun and two other teammates also fired, the fragile wood roof couldn’t hold the big action of the madman, they crawled slowly and made themselves the most Eye-catching target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Four directions, four times to find a lot of devils!" Still haven't waited to solve the fish that slipped through the waves, a sandman behind him exclaimed, "They are facing Come here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take me here!" cried the law, "You go to the other side!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;裘达 immediately turned the gun head and ran to another window - to say that the most accurate shot in the teammates is undoubtedly the law, he said that the remaining devil can be solved Then there must be no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when I saw hundreds of devils rushing to their hiding places, Minda’s heart sank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, are those guys just tempted?" Someone was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm afraid it is." He immediately made a judgment, "Everyone should not save ammunition, kill this wave of enemies and move to the six o'clock direction!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window instantly sounded intensive gunshots, including the newly issued bursts of weapons - called the general machine guns compared to the Mark type The new weapon sounds crisper, but it is not weaker than the giants at the rate of fire. The only downside is that it has only 30 rounds of magazines and is not as good as the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the enemy apparently did not expect that a small bell tower could burst out with such amazing firepower, hitting the general machine gun and rockets, and Only the devil suddenly lost more than half, while the surviving enemies raised their bone spears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Attention to the spear!" At the same time as the loud warning, the slammed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty bone spears, like the arrow of the string, broke into the top of the bell tower in the blink of an eye! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"铛"————!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell ring was knocked out A burst of humming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is on the ground, this shot can be described as a big disaster, but the terrain difference forms a natural shaded area, the bone projected from the bottom up. Even if the spear is full of windows, it is difficult to hit the fallen soldiers. The gunshots only stopped for a while and then resumed, and the remaining demons were caught in a dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have eaten this enemy squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;裘达 could not help but feel relieved, and my heart was slightly regrettable. I heard that the general machine gun was expensive, and it had to be used by the Cavaliers first. If the frontline troops can have one, even if they don't rely on the bunker, the devil will not be their opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this moment, Faye suddenly shouted, "No, get out of here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He groaned, subconsciously turned his head--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a broken wall in the distance, a huge spider After squatting over the wall, the open carapace opened, and the dark stone pillars loomed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, is the other party aiming at them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
