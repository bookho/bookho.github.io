			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem is in some sense unsolvable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that the total amount of food is limited - after the evil moon, the food flowing by the kingdom will enter a state of shortage, and the price will soar, it may not be able to buy . Until the wheat field is harvested, the lack of food will be alleviated, and the autumn is the most frequent season for grain trade, and it will rise rapidly when it reaches the evil moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these transactions are generally for businessmen and nobles. As for the penniless and the penniless, even if there is more wheat, they can only Hungry into the cold winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the experience of Barov as assistant to the Finance Minister for many years, at this time, major cities are waiting for the wheat to mature, and it is unlikely to sell food in large quantities. The gap of a thousand people may still be able to make up, and tens of thousands of people can't satisfy it anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open source is not good, it can only be throttled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing food supply throughout the city, reducing the number of daily purchases, allowing the people to change from eating bread to drinking porridge, sticking to the harvest day - this It is also the opinion that Isis is most likely to put forward. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he can promise from the under-the-counter, the facts and propaganda are contrary, the lack of food panic and other aspects refuted the inappropriateness of this practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Iisi looked up and looked at the list, I realized that this trouble was not easy to solve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not take long for her to ask herself what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Barov couldn’t help but touch the beard, the so-called overall control, not only have to be familiar with the government, but also have to be clear about the characteristics of the city. Chu. For example, in Wangdu, he can unabashedly recite the special price of the Alchemy Association and the number of silver mines shipped by Silver City every month. These are not remembered in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no characteristic of Winter City is the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baloff knows that there is a green-haired woman named Ye in the Witch Alliance that can make the wheat field grow at an incredible speed, when she does not care about the maintenance of the land, she It can even make the wheat ripe for a day, and the wheat ears that are produced are not comparable to the gold one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, just ask her to manage a field of wheat and focus on fast grain production to make up the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he also knows that His Majesty is letting the leaves control the hidden forest in the west, to build an early warning line against the devil, but given the emergence of such an enemy There are still years of time, and I am not in a hurry to stop for two or three months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the part that Itis has absolutely no way of knowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if she is talented again, she has been involved in the management of the Northland affairs since she was an adult, and it is impossible to complete this completely after arriving in the winter city for half a month. Unfamiliar cities are well aware of them, not to mention the ability of every witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She won’t even understand why the Office of the Ministry of Education is linked to the archives, and the Minister of Education often appears and has a look at all the documents. that power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Itis put down the list and slightly tilted her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This trouble is not difficult to solve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm..." Barov first Nodded, followed by a glimpse, "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Before the development of Glentown, most of the land in the Northland was not suitable for growing wheat, so one spring The food will be particularly tense, so the local lord will put his gaze on the east and the morning kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean-"He suddenly realized What is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can't buy it, you can't buy it, you can only grab someone else." Itis said easily. "This is not the case now." Your army is attacking the Dragon Ridge. I heard that the younger brother of Count Speer has fought a lot of local aristocrats in order to resist her. Right? Now the reasons are all right, kill them one by one. You guess their How many golden dragons and food are hidden in the basement?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
