			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyro did not expect that he would revisit so quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t want to leave the warm house in such a cold winter, especially when the evil beast was raging, but the Duke of Ryan named himself to hand over this hot paper. To the hands of the four princes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He certainly knows the content of the instrument - in fact, the upper aristocrats of the entire Grey Fort are discussing this amazing news: the king of the Grey Fortress fell for a murder It was Goron Wimbledon, the eldest son of the king who murdered him. Then he rushed to the kingdom to declare that the country could not be without a day, and he would be on the throne as the second heir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this behavior is not accepted by everyone. Some people claim that Goron’s trial is very embarrassing. After the whole questioning, he only revealed several times, and The mouth can't speak, and the hands are tied tightly. I hope that I can wait until things are completely checked before I decide to belong to the throne. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who rumor that this is only the second time that Feike Co. Wimbledon plays a self-directed drama. The real murderer is pretending to be a sad look. But can't wait to wait for the second prince to ascend. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter who is right or wrong in this debate, the second prince, with the full support of the former Prime Minister, still temporarily seized the supreme rule of the Grey Fortress as a king. The rights of the person. At the same time, he issued a recall order to all competitors - the king of war has ended, and the princes and queens should return to the kingdom before the end of winter after receiving the will. The new king will officially seal the territory and the title according to the six-month ruling situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perros can certainly see the urgency of this order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefco.Wambuton can sit on the throne and watch the reaction of other princes and daughters. If you give up the king and return to Wangcheng, then he will naturally become the undisputed Wimbledon IV. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The documents sent to Bianbu Town will be transferred to the Long Song Fortress, and the Duke of Ryan himself will sneer at this recall. When the king was alive, he had higher control over the local lords. As for the second prince, it was hard to make this fortune. Plus the example of Goron being sent to the guillotine, I am afraid that no one wants to return to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the eyes of the six fortresses, this is a timely order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than two months ago, the action of the Elk’s unauthorized plan made the Duke very unhappy, especially failed. The reaction of the prince was also very fierce. He directly sentenced Hills Meade to death. If the next one came, the two sides could be regarded as openly torn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Duke was going to wait until the end of the demon month to free up his hand to solve the trouble. Now with this official document, he can do more righteousness. Roland Wimbledon returned to the kingdom, and the town of Bentham was naturally owned by the Duke of Ryan. If he did not return to the king, he could force him by force - playing the banner of the new king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the final crown, the Duke did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the ambassador of Perot, obviously not very comfortable. The last time I vowed that I would bring a new trade contract, the result is the black hand of the elk family. Now he is coming, and it is also a bad news - whether it is the news of the death of Wimbledon III or the recall of the new king, Pei Luo believes that the four princes do not want to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailing along the way is fairly smooth. The Grey Fort is a country on the south side of the mainland. Even in winter, the river will not freeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puer from time to time through the window to the river bank to visit, not seeing the hungry on the way, did not see the people who fled, this shows that Bianbu Town still Not lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him a little surprised. After all, when he visited the city wall last time, he witnessed how the other side built the wall, for these muddy stone walls. Body, Pei Luo did not have much confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he was even more surprised, and a sailboat with the flag of Willow Town slowly drove past the right side of the river. This scene is familiar. But now it is the month of the demon! Are they still free to do business while fighting the evil beast? If you don't put all the miners on the line, how can you resist the cruel monsters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, the ship arrived at the pier in Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
