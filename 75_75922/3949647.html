Roland also preconceived that salt production is the main business of coastal cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are a salt well in the fortress, elk, and honeysuckle family territory... In fact, the three wells are very close, basically at the junction of the territories. More than two hundred years ago, the civil war in the West was often carried out in this area, and it took nearly 50 years to break the game. "Baroph said with a beard." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the three aristocrats who took the place became the biggest winner in the West? He asked with great interest, "What is the output of these salt wells?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to supplying the West, it will be sold to Chonglongling and Chishuicheng. And the small village along the way," Barov looked at the record on the book, "almost occupied about one and a half of the income of the fortress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So few "Roland is different. "The price of salt on the market is not low."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s too difficult to get the salt out of the deep well," the general manager shook his head, "I I know a nobleman in Yinguang City. He has a salt well in his territory. The wellhead is only the size of his head. Even the wooden barrels can't be placed. When collecting, you must first fill the water inside, and then use the salt to melt into the water. The bamboo poles came up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not expand the wellhead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balov Showing a smug smile, "His Royal Highness, because the salt layer is too deep, if you dig it in the way of the well, I am afraid that you will not be able to dig deeper and the inner wall will collapse." According to his statement, the salt well began to be mined from the grandfather's generation, and the depth of excavation is almost no more than a Wangdu bell tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original, Roland thought, It seems that limited by the depth of excavation, people in this era have chosen the method of brewing brine to collect well salt. This is an effective method, but there are obviously many potentials for improvement in the process – whether it is to use the power of lotus The salt mine is upgraded, or the steam pump is used to extract the brine, which can greatly improve the collection efficiency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have ample supply of salt, you can not only bring a lot of profits to the winter city, but also the healthier and more delicious salt can be spread to every citizen. At home - know that what they are eating now is still a mixture of coarse and salty salts of various impurities and foreign matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," the prince nodded with satisfaction, "You go on... Don’t let the population expand and work. The evil moon has just passed. Refugees who have lost their land should be caught in a food-free environment. This is a good time to recruit people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My thoughts are the same as you, Your Highness.” Barov raised his chest. “The new messenger group will soon leave. I think this time their harvest will be much higher than the previous year.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After the departure of the general manager, Roland was planning to use the mineral resources of the fortress, and a slap was heard outside the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and saw a gray ash falling on the window sill with a strip of paper tied to his claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night open the window and put the messenger inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a secret letter from the Changge District, written by Perot Hermon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland quickly browsed through the contents of the letter and couldn’t help but laugh. After the nightingale returned to the border area with the night, the work of cracking down on crimes was difficult. The information reported by the masses is varied, and it is difficult to tell which are the real situations and which are the rumors that were made for the bounty. The number of people applying for the job is not as much as half of the original number of rats. As the newly-introduced Minister of Justice, Rennes Meade, the daily hard work is not able to suppress the rise of the Black Street forces. If this continues, there will be a risk of further deterioration in law and order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyro wrote at the end of the letter, hoping that His Royal Highness can give human and technical help. Although he did not name it, Roland knew he wanted Nightingale and Vader. Can go to help the Earl of Elk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter was handed to the nightingale, and the latter frowned after sweeping it over. "So fast, can't hold it?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
