			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland, who is the lord of the West, naturally does not have to do it himself. He only needs to draw a rough appearance on the paper, and then he can make it clear with the recruited tailor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I haven’t touched the bra myself, there’s so much to see in all kinds of ads, TV shows and movies, and there’s so many shapes – he’s the most common The shoulder straps are buckled and the buttons are three sets of copper hooks. You can choose the degree of looseness within a certain range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing can meet the requirements of the corset because it needs to be worn close to the body, so Roland also called the maid in the castle to let the tailor measure the size, while the other engaged in cutting clothes. After many years, the experience is also very rich. After listening to the interpretation of His Royal Highness Prince, she immediately understood the role of the bra, and divided the size of the bra into several grades according to the actual measurement results, and subdivided the adjustment range under different grades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the prototype of the bra has already appeared in this era - that is, the corset. But it is not to make women more comfortable, but to tighten the waist as much as possible, and to hold up the chest, so that the body looks like an hourglass. Those gorgeous aristocratic dresses are also designed according to the thin waist. Without the support of the corset, I am afraid that it is difficult for the average woman to wear this dress with a very thin waist. Too much pressure on the waist is an extremely uncomfortable experience. In severe cases, it can even affect blood circulation and cause fainting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the bra, in addition to holding the chest, can also play a role in fixing and reducing tremors, everyday wear will only make women more relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just two days, the old tailor cut out 20 bras, the materials used are the satin provided by Roland and the good cotton, which is both beautiful and beautiful. Breathable, workmanship is also exceptionally fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before Roland sent the gift to the witch, the caravan from Wangdu arrived in Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the previous month's schedule, the fleet is not only late, but also far below the scale. The sailboat is docked after the town is expanded. At the edge of the dock, there is even a feeling of sparseness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, we met again," Margaret smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome, it’s hard for you to transport the fugitives before," Roland looked at the riverside fleet. "This sailing seems to be a lot less?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of some...accidental reasons," she wiped the sweat from her forehead. "If you don't mind, let's go to the living room to talk about it, here. It’s too hot.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I think so too,” Hogg muttered. “I’m a real gray-spot man, this ghost weather is simply I can kill my life. If it is not for the first steam engine, I don't want to leave the house."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded and took the group back to the castle. Going into the hall, a cool moment suddenly came to the face, Hogg gave a sigh of relief. "Thanks to the gods for letting us discover such a wonderful thing... I couldn't believe it if I didn't see the production process of the ice mang with my own eyes. It is from the manure. Oh, there is ice water! Your Highness, can I--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," Roland made a request The gesture, then sat back to the main seat and asked the woman, "So, what caused the accident this month - mainly the sharp drop of saltpeter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;According to the contract, she should provide at least three ships of saltpeter to Bianbu Town every month, but this time, there is only one sailing ship carrying saltpeter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the Wangdu Alchemy Association, they have been buying saltpeter recently, the price is not high, but with the support of the former Prime Minister, Marquis Wick, so this It’s not a pure deal, the merchants don’t want to sell it.” Margaret said, “I guess it’s the meaning of Tefco behind it. After all, the Prime Minister is almost out with a nostril.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tefico?" Roland asked questioningly, "Did he not go to the South?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's true," she nodded. "It seems that Tassa has already told you the news. I heard that he had brought a lot of people and heavy weights before he left the king, and he was in trouble with Garcia." The Alchemy Association’s acquisition of saltpeter was not long after he left.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knows more about this matter, and it’s really effective to arrange Tassa’s work in Wangdu. At the beginning, he only received news that Tefko had called the underground mouse. In order to prevent the other party from committing a sudden attack, he also specifically requested to train. Work to strengthen the realm of the fortress. However, the next secret letter of the Guardian gave Roland a sigh of relief - Tiefco went straight to the South, and apparently the recruitment was not directed against him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
