			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fjord has countless islands, and no one has ever been to the borders of these islands," said a tall, rough-looking man. The more eastward, the more unpredictable the climate is, and the islands are the same. I really don't know how far they can be surprised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if you Didn't you arrive?” Tilly asked curiously. “They said that you are the most outstanding explorer in the fjord. Few people except you dare to cross the island of ignition and continue to move east.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha," he laughed heartily. "This is a magnified praise. In fact, every year, brave flocks open up to the east. It’s just that it’s hard to find any new discoveries. The violent hurricane and the sudden fog will make it difficult for the ship to move.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the Thunder, the ash, the first Discover the explorers of the Shadow Islands, but since they lost their tracks in a shipwreck two years ago, many people think he Fortunately, the victims, he did not think there will be sleeping in the island, but also women and five kings reached an agreement - by his pioneering a new route for the sleeping island, nautical charts and look for more new sites, Tilly is sent to assist him Witch adventure. As for the two years of disappearance, she did not listen to the other party, and Tilly did not talk about it, but she always felt that her Highness knew the inside story, otherwise the two would not be so tacit. This makes the ashes feel a little unpleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the hurricane of yesterday?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, blink of an eye, instant It’s fleeting,” Thunder shook the pipe, sprinkled the ash into the sea, and refilled with some blades of grass to ignite, “If there wasn’t that magical witch—”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"She is called Molly," the ash-hard state reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, yes, oh, this is my memory," Thunder didn't take it for granted, and smiled at the back of his head. "If it's not Moryl, I'm afraid." The boat will be turned to the sky. Her ability is simply fantastic, I often think that perhaps the witch is the most suitable explorer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "No," Tilly smiled, "...the witch who inherited the name of the most outstanding explorer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔..." Thunder took a deep breath The pipe, spit out a long stream of smoke, "I hope so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, the ash frowned, and the two couldn’t understand it. She simply left the bow and went to the stern to calm down. His Royal Highness the Five Kings seemed to be very urgent in exploring the remains. After cleaning up the fjord church, he immediately set about preparing for the sea. What surprised her was that His Highness asked to go in person, and it was useless to discourage himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molly is sitting at the stern, controlling its magical servant holding the fishing rod and learning to fish with the sailors. Although the sailors had some resistance to the witch when they got on the boat, everyone’s attitude has changed dramatically since yesterday’s hurricane. Morier’s magical servant has swiftly expanded and wrapped the middle part of the sailboat into the body. It is a gust of wind and heavy rain that cannot penetrate. Although the ship is ups and downs in waves of waves, the hull is always stable. Today, every sailor regards the witch as a god of fortune, and even says that no witches accompany him in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grey sister, look at the big fish I caught!" Morrier pointed at the bucket behind him, lying inside with a sharp, pointed mouth The scalefish are quite different from the river fish seen in the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Swordfish, like to go with the boat, sometimes Its sharp mouth will break the bottom of the boat," the sailor replied. "But it tastes delicious, especially the meat in the abdomen. It is like melting ice in the mouth," he said. "Everyone can Enjoy the delicious live-boiled swordfish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I seem to have another fish hook!" Moryl surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a black shadow appearing under the green water, and as the magic servant lever moves more and more, it will soon surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...this is," the sailor snorted. "No, throw away the fish!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has not fallen, a strange creature has jumped out of the water, opened his mouth and bite directly to Molier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
