			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland groaned, "Is there any problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is..." Felice hesitated. "I heard that in your territory, only one witch was awakened last year?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out a drawer The list - that is Wendy's statistics for him, which records the witch's awakening day and adult day, so that he does not miss the second birth of the witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should be right," Roland looked through the list and nodded. "Although the new year of the evil year joined two witches, the white paper was as early as three. I was awakened a few years ago, and I was only awakened by the year, and her awakening day happened to be an adult day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This should not "Your Majesty," Felice raised her brow. "How many people were there in your city last year? Is 20,000 or 30,000?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There should be five Wan, "When it comes to the population, Roland can't help but be proud. "The number of people without winter city has exceeded 100,000 this year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"100,000 words and early Anretta is almost the same, until Tuckerland was only about 250,000 before exiting the fertile plains. But... Do you know the number of awakenings in the two holy cities every year?" Felice said, " Even in the period when the magic is the most poor, there is no less than ten people in Anretta, and Takira is nearly three times this number."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic...poor period?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the magic that fills the world is ups and downs, like the tides. "Ai Gesha explained, "The two years after the arrival of the Red Moon is also the most abundant moment of the magic. Almost every day there will be a new witch. Then the free magic will slowly weaken, to the interval between the two red moons." Time can be regarded as a period of poverty, and it is almost only when the demon moon is reached that the awakened person will appear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more powerful the magic, the easier it is for the witch to wake up. Roland also heard about Ai Gesha before. Only he thought that the magic would usher in a peak every year. I didn't expect it to fluctuate wildly for hundreds of years. "But we are not far from the third battle of God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the most worrying issue," Felice said The color, "The emergence of Hell fear beast means that the Red Moon is approaching, the magic trend should be more active, and according to Selen's test, the fact is true. But why is the number of witches awakened so low? Even in the city No one is awake, and the towns and villages in the suburbs should also have the birth of a girl who is not a witch. For example, in the era of Tacharia, the surrounding territories provided more witches than the holy city. Generally speaking, the larger the population, the more the witch The more this is the law that the Federation has summed up for hundreds of years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I initially thought that no winter city intentionally abandoned the woman when recruiting people. Later, I thought that the influence of the church made the new women not easily reveal their identity, which led them to not join the winter city without any result... It seems that this is not the case.” Ai Gesha said slowly, “Passa has also carried out Discussion, the final conclusion is: maybe there is something It has affected the awakening of the new witch, and there is a tendency to gradually expand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pondered for a while before he said, "Assuming this guess is correct, you Is there a way to find out what caused this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other and shook their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can't solve it, let's take a break as a god," he said. "In any case, no matter how the probability of awakening changes, we have to catch the devil." Out of the light, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, once the industrial production has laid the foundation, the demand for witches is far less strong than that of the gods or the planners, otherwise This is really a terrible news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What you said...is really right," Felice probably didn’t expect Roland’s confidence in fighting the devil to be unaffected, and it took a while to return. God comes, "We must defeat the devil anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is," Roland smiled. "Oh, yes... I used to I am looking for you to ask for one thing." He told his concern about the possible harm to the witch when he was awakened. "How did the Federation deal with such incidents when it was in Tahira?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
