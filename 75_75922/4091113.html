			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For both factions, there is no objection to regaining the East and destroying the church. This is what the previous meeting has long been included in the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference is when to retaliate against the morning sun. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the clear diplomatic attitude that Roland showed before, this time no one has taken a step back and the practice has been revealed. However, the officials of the city hall still hope that after the end of the ceremony, the negotiation of "justification" will not rule out the use of force. Apparently, the future planning meeting of the evil month gave them enough temptation and motivation. They all thought that they would support the four princes as soon as possible and become the king of the gray castle, and they could also become real kingdom ministers from local officials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to go deep into the morning battle, you need to mobilize a large number of troops and resources, and the enthronement will obviously be affected. No king will send himself when he ascended the throne. The elite will, and then simply smashed the grass to complete the coronation ceremony, so that no matter who is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the final decision still depends on Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In three days, he just looked at everyone’s discussion and did not show a clear tendency, and he was judged by the tough attitude of the previous diplomatic letter. It is also because of his silence that the people have a heated debate space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that he changed his mind, but he is waiting for an opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An opportunity to get the most benefit at the least cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the evening, someone knocked on the door of the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a little relieved when he saw Andrea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s finally coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she does not take the initiative, she can only find her by herself - the effect will undoubtedly be much worse, and can not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, dried fish," the nightingale showed up and handed her a piece of honey-boiled fish. In addition to Wendy, the other party can be regarded as a witch who can share snacks from the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the attraction between the nobility? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," but Andrea’s interest doesn’t look too high. She took the fish and took it into her pocket, then she went to the chest and bowed. , I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was halfway, she stopped again and didn't seem to know how to express it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You want me to save your childhood partner, Otto Locy, right?" Roland couldn't let Andrea hesitate anymore. Going on, if she changes her mind, are these days not waiting? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, he also faintly guessed the other’s hesitation, one thing is certain, Otto and her should be a unilateral crush relationship, because of this She didn't know what position to use to make this request. Childhood playmate? After so many years, Andrea did not miss the past in the morning kingdom. After all, Count Quinn found that she was a witch, did not protect her, but directly forged the end of an unexpected death, this kind of memory is really not How wonderful it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the winter of Otto’s visit, there was no winter. Andrea’s performance was very clear, and obviously did not want to have any relationship with the past. Looking for the door now, I am afraid it is just because of the kindness and carelessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." She took a deep breath and slowly nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But at the meeting, you also heard everyone’s discussion. If you want to force Ampein to submit, you need at least 3,000 troops, plus offense. The forces of the Holy City will increase to about 5,000, which is already the strength of the first army of 80%."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the differences, the City Hall and the Staff A rough plan has been made - since neither the Hermes Plateau nor the Dawn Kingdom has a water system directly connected to the Grey Fort, the supply can only rely on carriages and manpower, and the number of logistics teams is staggering. In addition, the remaining 20% ​​need to stay in the kingdom, so that the First Army has no spare capacity to garrison the land, can only be finished. Calculated comprehensively, it is definitely a loss-making business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
