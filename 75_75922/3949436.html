			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia took the ore to the prince's way, and still wandered around the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that she was shocked by the calm attitude of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t understand the feelings, but the witch and the prince... can’t be together at all? In this way, isn’t it necessary to hide your mind carefully in your heart and not let the other person know? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, why do she even feel as if she is a listener? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a deep breath at the door of the office, and Lucia pushed the door inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, I brought the ore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me see," Roland yawned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruler of Bentham Town seems to be in peacetime, and the sleepy look should be just after waking up from the nap, he leaned back on the chair Naturally, the tone is easy-going, not as aggressive as other nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia’s inexplicable mood has also relaxed a lot. She took out the ore particles found in the northern slope mine from the skin, one by one. On the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ability to decompose, these particles look almost the same, the color is not silver or gray, probably only the prince of the versatile prince can tell what this is The ore is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw the prince frowning for a long time, one by one in the palm of his hand, and looked at the sun behind him carefully, and finally waved, " I have a cough, these minerals will be handed over to Mr. Staple to identify them. You will continue to practice your ability in the backyard of the North Slope. If you don't understand, please ask Anna."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Hey, even the Highness does not know? Lucia quickly bowed her head, "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she was about to leave the office, Roland stopped her again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, you have a good test score this time, and you are ranked ninth in 68 points. Only after you have studied for a month can you have such performance." It’s not easy, I have to keep it. And...” He paused. “When I test the next time, I hope that the bell can also participate with everyone.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes!" Lucia said excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After watching the little girl happily squatting, Roland looked at the metal particles on the table and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am still too naive. After I think that it is broken down into simple elements, I can understand the mineral veins in the northern slope of the mine. However, the facts let He understood the huge gap between mechanical engineering and geology – these stones eventually differentiated into three or four metals, and the most retained ones could be considered as ores of such metals, but they are in color and shape. It is almost the same. For example, iron, aluminum, magnesium and potassium are silver-white metals in high purity. It is too difficult to distinguish them by the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take this problem to the chief alchemist to solve it. After all, verifying the material properties through chemical reactions is much more reliable than guessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing this matter, Roland took out a piece of paper and began planning how to deal with this year's demon month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the summer is coming to an end soon, the three months of the fall is his final preparation time, in addition to resisting the evil beasts in the west, you have to keep an eye on it. Tofico and the church in the east. Not in the last year, the population and income under his rule have grown substantially, and the output of ironmaking has gradually increased. The number of witches has increased by more than a dozen. It is completely certain that the western environment will become an insurmountable wall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the combat experience of the previous year, the biggest threat to the city wall is undoubtedly a mixed kind of evil beast, especially when the enemy has a thick shell and the bullet is difficult to wear. Either close to the use of explosives packs, or send witches out of the city to fight, regardless of the countermeasures, the danger will be greatly improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
