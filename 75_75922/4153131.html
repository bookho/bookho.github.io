			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, can I try?" Kemer Stern couldn't wait to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Roland smiled and bowed. "This time it will be reported by you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief alchemist thought for a moment, writing a series of long and short staggered characters on the small blackboard, the total number of more than twenty. If there is a possibility that the three sides and two points are just right, this message basically excludes the factor of luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recipient is still Barov. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He obviously didn’t want to end this extraordinary experience so quickly, and Roland opened his eyes and pretended to wear a blindfold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arc of the jump once again blooms between the spark gaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the boss took longer to listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he recorded the answer on paper and showed it to everyone, the crowd finally burst into applause! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are two errors in more than twenty characters, the number is quite a lot, exactly the same as the information written by Kemo! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can never be guessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, in less than a few seconds, the message has been exchanged between No Winter City and Silver City - the only way to explain Why did he know what Kemo sent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How far can the tower send out the news at most?" Barov asked excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as the power is increased, there are no problems in theory thousands of kilometers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Doesn't that cover the entire territory of the four kingdoms?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, everyone can't help but whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, even the Fertile Plains are basically included."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Winterever occurs The next thing, the next dark castle will know, this is too unbelievable!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed, if I don’t see it, I really can’t I believe this is what humans can do..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barof is already considering deeper issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Under, if we give specific meaning to these symbols, we may be able to convey more complex content, such as instructions and decrees..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When witnessing a new technology, the first time to think about how to use it, I have to say that the boss’s insights and ideas are much broader than the original, obviously in these years. He also changed a lot to adapt to the dominance of this emerging kingdom. Roland smiled appreciatively. "The direction is correct, but it can be done more thoroughly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not give specific meaning to symbols, but assign existing text to specific symbols, so that even if you can't hear human voices, you can communicate in real time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balph thought for a moment, the eyes could not help but emit light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously he is also aware of the great significance of this "new text." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the world’s text uses a completely different phonological system, it cannot be applied directly to another world’s telegraph code, but in principle In the case, as long as you spend more time, you can always develop a suitable communication code list. With these code tables, any text information can be converted into corresponding electrical signals, which are transmitted at various speeds across the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for who made the telegraph code, Roland had long been planning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty..." Agriculture Minister Sene Dali is eager to raise his hand. "Can I try this electricity...airplane?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Of course," Roland looked at everyone. "If you are interested, you can experience it yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No winter city executives immediately blasted the pot, They swarmed and quickly put a table around the machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at this scene, Anna walked to Roland and shook her head with a funny smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland naturally understands the meaning of her smile. The spark transmitter and ore receiver are just the least technical part of the radio communication plan. The former is in the full frequency band. Sending information out of the sea, the latter's unrelenting acceptance, the two sides seem to be a natural fit, but also allows a region to pass only a set of information in the same time period. In fact, after being replaced by more advanced tube wireless devices, the spark transmitter has been used for a while in the interference field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding this system requires a huge world and a certain output power, so the volume and weight are difficult to reduce, and it is destined to be placed in only a few important cities. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the tube prototype is mature, broadcasts and radio stations that can directly transmit sound signals without interfering with each other will bring the first peak of radio communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how surprised they will be at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that Anna is looking forward to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that, in this regard, he has a very similar hobby with the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as everyone was eager to "talk" to Silver City, Roland suddenly felt a strong sense of dizziness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It came so quickly that the outlines of things in the house were ghosted. He closed his eyes subconsciously and wanted to suppress the spread of dizziness, but the body seemed to lose its center of gravity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ann was the first to notice his strangeness and reached out and grabbed his arm. "Roland, are you alright?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm fine... Roland wanted to answer this, but Zhang's opening was a violent cough. He covered his mouth and filled his throat with sweet taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, what the hell is going on? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyelids sinking quickly, as heavy as a thousand, with a little red in the open palm, which is out of place with everything around. Despite all his efforts to stay awake, consciousness is still far away from him, and Anna seems to be screaming at him, but he can't hear anything except the screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body falls back uncontrollably, and finally it is the figure of the nightingale and the fog that spreads quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Roland opened his eyes, he found himself back in the castle bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for him to sit up and beside him The low voice of the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a rush of footsteps, and Anna appeared on the bed in the blink of an eye—obviously she stayed in the house and didn’t leave herself too far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you feeling?" She leaned over and pressed his forehead and whispered, "Where is it uncomfortable?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm..." Roland felt for a moment, "No. I feel that my body is very smooth, just like sleeping in a big room, the spirit is much better than usual." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the eyes of the two people questioning, he reluctantly applauded, "It’s true, except..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?" Anna and the book asked in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
