			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The connection process is smoother than expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the core coherence, Celine "sees" the inside of the obelisk - or rather, the whole of this control system. It consists of four magical cores, the obelisk itself and the underlying mother form an extremely clever system. The magic oscillated back and forth among these people, constantly emitting a harmonious embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After some pondering, she has a better understanding of the system: the four cores use different abilities to maintain the functioning of the gods, and control them The mother of the obelisk at the bottom - of course, this is not completely accurate, as can be seen from the flow of magic, the mother has only played a transformational role, like the operating lever on the Skyfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the lever will activate several gears, valves or cables, it is internally set up, the key is that it greatly simplifies the complexity of the operation. . It usually takes a lot of time to operate a core, not to mention controlling four at the same time, but after this incredible transformation, it seems to become feasible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has to admit that Nasopelle, who came up with this system, is a genius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't say that the same system was re-enacted. If I didn't use Roland to learn a lot of knowledge about the world of dreams, she would not even understand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this also made Celine doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation has observed the record of the mother, which is clearly a strange devil, just like the chaotic beast that produces the magic stone. Since it is a kind of creature, it should have a sense of autonomy, which will undoubtedly cause obvious obstacles to control. How did the devil lord turn it into a "tool" that was completely obedient? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, from this system, the obelisk body does not seem to matter, it plays a more role in accepting and amplifying - as The key thing that the devil relies on for survival is not the god of God, which is somewhat different from what she expected before she connected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With strong curiosity, Celine stretched her consciousness to the devil's mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, an incredible picture is presented to her -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God Where..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but make an exclamation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a huge "net." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this network of many glowing lines, there are many flashing nodes, she realizes that it is the city of the devil, and they are concentrated The area is the continent opposite the light - Black Stone! More than that, Celine also saw many more faint nodes, scattered outside the net, like a tarnished pearl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Catherine even more shocked is that there is an inexplicable familiar feeling inside the mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her entry was not blocked at all, as if it were just a place frequented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vector! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylin quickly reacted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, although it is still a type of devil, it has become a living thing similar to a carrier in the transformation. There is no longer a sense of autonomy, and it will only act according to certain instincts. This is the key to its ability to act as a “control center”! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt that this technique is inseparable from the underground civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out to be the case... There was a very complicated feeling in the mind of Serin, which was the excitement of discovering new technology and the insight behind the scenes. chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the technology of the genocide, the Witch Federation implemented the transformation plan of the “death witch”, and how could it not be the devil who absorbed the fragments of inheritance? Take advantage of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is quite puzzling to her is that this transformation should be to control a number of core instruments so that they can exert amazing results. In addition to the gods created by God, other cities should not need to do this. After all, this is full of risks, not to mention the deprivation of consciousness for the “reformed”. The mother is responsible for the growth of the obelisk, and the importance of the devil's group is self-evident, and the status is definitely not too low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she saw that the mothers who represent the city nodes have been more or less modified and are moving towards a complete container, which is somewhat unreasonable. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang does not care about the lives and deaths of many devils in the city? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Appreciate enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange voice sounded behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylin was frightened and jumped, and it suddenly "returned to look" and saw a strange devil appear in his eyes. It has no humanoid appearance of the general high-end devil, the lower body is similar to a reptile, the upper body has more than a dozen hands, and the shape of the hand is also varied. The most conspicuous is its head, like a deformed column with many masks hanging from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time she only reacted, she could actually turn around in consciousness! I don't know when she is no longer a light soul, but an entity with weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect anyone other than me to get here." The voice of the other party was full of joy. "It seems that you are just like me, abandoning the original." The body is not bound by any rules, just to seek knowledge and truth! How can my work satisfy you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already not needed The opening asked, this devil must be the masked monarch in the mouth of the sky, Nasopelle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can I see my own appearance...what did you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You should be able to guess it." The fake face opened his hand. "Is this not like the ideology?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailin could not help but look up A change, "It's hard to be you--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this is the 'consciousness' I created!" It made a series of mixed laughs. "Why do you need talent in the source of magic? Why do some people can come in and out at will, and some want to touch it is difficult? What I hate most is those who are born with extraordinary."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No." Serin calmed down and thought about the descriptions of the dream world by those companions. "If you want to see your own words, you can do it in a mirror. In the conscious world." It can show all things accurately. There is nothing but a glowing net. And the most important... I see only the appearance of the carrier, not the real one. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, what is wrong with the carrier? If you don't rely on this body, you can't even control the core of the magic." The mask is scorned, "consciousness The world is just a name, no one can stipulate what it must be - although this is really just a by-product of the experiment. As for what I really did, isn't that a clear thing?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It came to Catherine and then "worn" her. "Of course it is to get rid of the imprisonment of the body and become a detached existence!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylin was stunned for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Any body has a limit, there is no perfect body in this world! In this case, why should I go on the road of destiny? See this Is the net open?" The voice of the mask is getting higher and higher. "With it, I can be omnipresent. It grows stronger than any body. When it develops to a certain extent, I even exist in multiple places. Or, create countless 'I'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With these me, you can go to the most dangerous places and conduct the most dangerous tests, without any Look for all the mysteries of the world! You should know what it means!” Nasopelle raised all the handwritings. “All feelings, experience and insights will be attributed to me. This efficiency of knowledge will surely make me A new evolution has occurred - no talent is needed, and it has nothing to do with the magic stone. Isn't this a dream that the seeker dreams of!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
