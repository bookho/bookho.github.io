			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are your parents teaching you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, mainly my Father," Xuelun nodded. "He often said that there are many wrong things in the world, but it is precisely because no one stands up to correct them and let the mistakes continue. Over time, people become accustomed to it. Common things don't equal. The right thing, everyone is just repeating a mistake. The more such a situation, the worse the world will be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, as long as it does not endanger yourself, Most people won't stand up." Wendy slowed down. Just as the church persecuted the witches, the people only stared at the bounty of twenty-five golden dragons, but did not care whether the children who were hanged were really evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This idea is wrong," Xuelun replied. "If the world gets worse, that is everything for everyone, and some seem to be with themselves." Unrelated mistakes will spread to one day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can teach such a child, Wendy can not help but have a little interest in her parents, When she asked this question inadvertently, Shelen’s answer surprised her. “They are not my parents.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, my parents have passed away," the girl’s action of eating slowed down when she said these words. "The Eagle City was destroyed after the war, the South The order was broken. The homeless refugees and beggars were everywhere, and the robbers and robbers were also increased. Parents were members of the patrols, they were resisting robbers and looting... When the lord fled, the townspeople had to leave the town six times, and Fenghua Town should now become a deserted territory."<br /><br />&nb Sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, this tragedy is precisely because of the war, and in a sense also confirms her father's words - seemingly unrelated mistakes, will eventually expand to the head of all on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wentillo apologetically touched Shiron’s head, “Sorry... mention these things.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter," the little girl's look quickly returned to normal. She could see that she was not immersed in the grief of losing her loved ones. "In fact, they are ready when they are out... One of the words that my father often hangs on is that instead of paying the price for mistakes, it is better to put the cost on correcting the mistakes. The former is a crime and the latter is an honor."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honour... Wendy suddenly feels guilty. For most town patrols, the survival rules are similar to those of mice, which is to draw interest in maintaining a unique order. When there is a conflict between order and interest, there is no doubt that the change will be order. It can be said that people like Snowen’s parents can be said to be surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being silent for a while, she then asked, "The person who came to see you is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"My father's friend, who had received his help before." Xue Lun licked his fingers. "In the past two years, I have been living with Uncle Mark. They have no children, and they are like my own. General."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that Wendy is silent. Being able to do this is a very rare thing for an ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stopped asking, watching the little girl finish eating dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl swallowed the last piece of fried meat and gave a sigh of relief. The expression was full of satisfaction. "Thank you, this is what I have eaten." The best thing to eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although no winter city supplies are extremely rich, people no longer have to worry about filling their stomachs, but meat is always scarce Product. The average person can put a piece of dried meat in the porridge, which is already a rich life that he could not think of before. As for the semi-lean meat that was fried with hot frying, basically only the alchemist, the town hall manager, etc. High-paying people can afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty smiled and took out her handkerchief and wiped her shiny lips. "When you join the Witch Alliance, you can eat such food every day." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Xuelun’s eyes lit up, “Can you eat meat every day?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
