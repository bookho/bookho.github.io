			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dungeon of the palace was once the nightmare of the four princes, and down the stone steps, this feeling could not help but flood into Roland's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the memory, he quickly found the source of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of twelve, Tiefola took the Four Princes and Goron and Garcia to explore the basement of the hall, and the four princes who always wanted to integrate into their circles naturally I couldn't help but didn't expect Tiefko to steal the key from the guard, put the four princes in jail, and then the three left with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark and dark room, the four princes were afraid of getting trembled, not even shouting out loud. Because the occasional screams of crying can be heard in the hall, the guard said that it was the ghost of the earth, and he was afraid that the cry would bring these undead to him. In the end, he had to shrink the corner of the wall and bury his head in his knee. Sobbing. By the time the three people came to the joke the next morning, his nose had already covered his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, the Four Princes never dared to approach the basement of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Roland naturally understands that the so-called ghosts cry, but the screams when tortured the prisoners. Only a small number of prisoners who are eligible to be admitted to the palace will be heard occasionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the bottom of the basement, Roland saw Tefco Wimbledon in a small cell, where the four princes buried their heads and cried all night. The place - the prison in the outer city, the environment here is actually quite good, at least not seeing water everywhere, rats and cockroaches flowing, the air is full of moisture and stench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ironically, the position of the two has now been exchanged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the noise, he opened his eyes by Tiffco sitting on the wall and staggered with Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the most feared brother of the Four Princes - his appearance is similar to that in memory, and the short curly hair and eyes symbolize the Wimbledon family. The lineage, nose and cheek contours inherit the characteristics of the father and look sharp and handsome. Only the slender eyes ruined the overall feeling, and under the swaying torch light, it seemed a bit gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was before, the Four Princes did not even dare to look at the second brother, but for Roland, he was just a stranger who was removed from his minions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were silent for a long time, and only a moment of the torch was heard in the cell. There was a slap in the face of Tiffco's face, even though he still wanted to put on the momentum of the past to overwhelm himself, but everything was in vain. The tough look gradually dissipated from his eyes, replaced by an unspeakable fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You...who is it?" Tiefco finally couldn't stand it and broke the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of cognac echoed in the basement, and the mood inside was also clearly distinguishable. He was afraid, Roland thought, as the other side would ask this question, Roland is not surprised, compared to Tilly, who has very little communication, Tiffco knows more about the four princes. After all, the latterâ€™s bad character is largely partly It was caused by the two princes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Roland. Wimbledon," he crouched down and looked at him. "Don't you remember me?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not!" Tiefco trembled. "He can't look at me like this. He doesn't dare to face me!" He gasped. "I know... ...you are the real devil! Not that he was lured by the devil, but the devil turned into his appearance, trying to steal this kingdom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one will die Roland, he does not bother to explain what, "What about it? How much do you think you can be better than the devil? Murder the biological father, push the conspiracy to the brothers, and then kill him. In order to save the stolen throne, not only with The most disgusting church power of the father colluded, forcing the innocent people to attack the territory of the three kings, even the most weak and incompetent four princes, you have not let go. In just one year, the kingdom is in a mess, several cities Destroyed in the war, refugees can be seen everywhere, I am afraid that the devil can't do this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" he sighed and argued, "The father is not killing me, he is committing suicide! Like you, he is controlled by the devil!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
