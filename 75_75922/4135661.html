			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later, the desolate mountain valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last test of napalm bombs, it has become a new weapon test site - it is closer to the North Slope Laboratory, and It’s hard to get the attention of the public. With the increasing development of the secluded forests, the flow of people inside and outside the northwest city walls is far from what it used to be. The previous practice of plotting a quarantine area in the suburbs of the past is obviously not appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that the power of weapons will continue to grow in the future, the migration of the test site has become a matter of course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time Roland is going to test, it’s the individual anti-magic grenade that was decided before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the advancement of the overall industrial level and the sufficient data preparation in advance, the weapon has only been separated from the trial production to the actual shooting for only five days. The fastest record in the history of weapons development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is indistinguishable from the structure of a single grenade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another world, the extremes of Lien Chan’s five slag can be made into giant RPGs with gas tanks and drain pipes. Co-installed self-propelled artillery, not to mention the absence of a winter industrial city supported by a complete industrial system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as the bullet is aimed at the target, press the trigger again?" Elx asked with a tentacle to roll up the launch tube and asked with great interest. Apparently, as a former high-ranking saint warrior, she is full of interest in new firearms, not to mention the weapon was developed specifically for the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this scene is a bit strange in Roland’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sarcoma monster with a huge body and full of tentacles is almost a frequent visitor in the horror story. Some of them rely on their eyes to shoot light, and some rely on swords and iron shields. And there are strong suckers and special liquids that are secreted to fight the brave... but holding RPG? Uh... I always feel that there is something wrong with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let the original carrier work as a tester for safety reasons. Once a single grenade is fired, the soldiers who operate at close range basically have only one end, even if it is a god. The penalty witch will not be good. Only the original carrier can extend the tentacles to a safe enough place to avoid tragedies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't let the tail face yourself or someone else," Roland coughed twice. "Get started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Aer's point the main must, press the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of the fire broke out and flew straight toward the target 100 meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing a shallow arc, the warhead accurately hits the target... below, with a bang, the iron that is used as the target The box rolled back two turns and looked unscathed. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the smallest test of the movement compared to the bombardment of the fortifications of the earth-shaking or the cosmopolitan flames that cover the sky. In fact, let alone the explosion of the fire, even the dust and gravel picked up are few, and the mountain wind is blown out in less than the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." The scene was a little embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Roland smiled. "Go and take it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon There were two gods and witches who ran back in the iron box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a close-up observation that everyone noticed that the bottom of the box was White, like what was burned. In the center of the white spot, there is an inconspicuous cavity with about three fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put it out?" Pasha curiously. "It’s not slow when flying, but it’s not going anywhere, at least it’s more eye-catching than bullets. Much more... Can the runners not wear the box?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if the Mark 1 heavy machine gun does not necessarily do it," El暇 暇 , , , , , , , , 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这 这Why, open it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
