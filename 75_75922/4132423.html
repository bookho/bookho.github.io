			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The connection to the ideology is a very troublesome thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to use words to describe it, it is burning and chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former comes from the source of magic - although it is the root of all power, the end of all competition, and the basis for the existence of the consciousness, can be upgraded Before that step, any behavior close to it will be ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter, from the consciousness itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic awakens to a certain extent, will leave a mark of consciousness at the source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless senses gathered here, like the seawater covering the earth, some sinking into the bottom, and then difficult to trace; some are still floating, drifting with the tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between the two is whether consciousness itself is aware of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also one of the characteristics of distinguishing between lower and higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sinking is dead, no use value; the proof that has been floating has been to the conscious world, even if it has only been seen, it has other life Essentially different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod is one of the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It not only gains recognition of the source of magic, but also masters the ability to connect with the conscious community. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows it to actively search for valuable information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this kind of thing is not suitable for regular work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of consciousness are always mutual, and the time is long to be easily contaminated; plus acting inside is like walking through the turbulent flow, slightly If you are not careful, you will lose your way. Once you enter the ideology, you will never return. Only one kind of empty shell is left in the minority. It does not want to follow its footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the above two points, the main reason is that Heckzor does not like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating is only temporary, even if it is higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of the subject of the burden, the consciousness will soon sink into the source of magic, the upper layer will be replaced by the newly awakened individual, this scene reminds that it is not eternal, It will also have a moment of annihilation before it is fully upgraded. Feeling the rushing consciousness is like witnessing the demise of oneself, which makes it difficult to immerse it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Heckzod found a touch of familiarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...Cabradorby? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the other party so weak? It’s almost like it’s going to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worms even kill it, and it’s not like this - sinking to the bottom, it’s also the awareness of the promoters, as the warrior of the Western Army commander Death does not dispel its consciousness, it should be enough to look for it yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Cabrada is not only far from the promotion, not even the female. According to the magic that is attached to it, it is impossible to enter the ideology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod imagined that he had stretched out the consciousness by sticking out his hands that did not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of Heaven," then a voice awakens it from the consciousness, "The king is calling you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looked back at the guard. "I know, go on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecksod releases the fragments of the faint red light that are still escaping and flies toward the top of the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the latter allowed Dajun, who was scattered everywhere, to talk directly to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the tower has the strongest fog. This wet feeling dispels the unhappiness of the connected consciousness. Heikezod put his hand on the tower and gathered his spirits. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord of Heaven is coming from your call, my king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" How was it going?" The voice of the king rang, "There is not much time left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any change in the Tianhai world?" Asked subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, and the scale is unusually large, the first refusal proposal is the majority. After all, the god of God will soon be completed, and after it starts, The situation of defending only can be completely reversed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God of God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod’s heart was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimate creation of the legend, finally...has to be realized? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get rid of the limitations of the magic stone veins and move freely in every corner of the world. This was once the goal of countless similar cravings, and it is now in sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As its name suggests, this is both a gift from God and a further step in the source of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of Heaven uses his consciousness to express his reverence for the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what is your answer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The West Line has encountered some changes," Kzod wanted to get back to everything, and the king was under the pressure of the heavens and the sea. It should not add any trouble to it. But the loyalty to the king should be absolute. It is not what it should do for the king. "My commander report, those..." It paused, but decided to use the official title - this is their past self-proclaimed "These humans have changed a lot from four hundred years ago, especially in combat mode. The leading troops have suffered some losses, but they will not affect the plan."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the report, Wang was silent for a little while. "Is it the result of evolution?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has nothing to do with evolution. It's like the use of utensils and natural elements - such as the fire we are not familiar with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even the magic is not?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s true that my commander had intended to take some humans back and seize a few weapons in kind, but as before, unfortunately failed." Heikezod said, "It suggested me. Add some troops to the West Line, or find out why through the conscious world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "Is the promotion person in the hands of human beings?" Wang is not quick to say, "Although since the promotion has become much looser, I have expected that there will be such a day, but it is too fast. I remember the west line. The commander is your proud subordinate, and the title of the genius general. Are you sure that it has not been derelict?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod quickly bowed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the result?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing has been discovered, its magic is almost No, I can't know the details in this state." It hesitated, "but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the moment of touching the consciousness, I seem to see an unusually bright flame... probably an illusion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's a flame, then don't worry about it." Wang replied, "Although we rarely use it, we know enough about it. What's more, learning from humans is history. As for the first request, I am for you." The veto will be fine. The attack in the Tianhai world is the focus. I can't mobilize more troops for you. You can't pull out the existing troops and lead to internal emptiness. Don't forget, the inheritance fragments that are related to the ethnic group upgrade are now up to you. In custody!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
