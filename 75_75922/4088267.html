			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although quite a bit of strong buying and selling, the Fiordland merchants finally accepted the selection. They all know that if they quit now, others will only swallow along with that one – in the face of goods without substitutes, this little concession is nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they also have to admit that Roland has a certain reason. The samples brought back have not been the fruit wine or other drinks on the market despite the obvious difference in taste. The only difference is that you can earn more and earn less. Moreover, the regions in charge of sales are different, and the possibility of competition is not high, which further reduces the risk of selecting the next-class products. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Moore and others looking around the barrel, even using the nose to sniff and trying to find some residual drinks, Roland laughed. Don't look at the ordinary shape of these buckets, but there is a layer of film drawn by Soroya, which completely isolates the inside and outside air. It is definitely not a difference between the nose and the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While picking up chaotic drinks, he quietly called Margaret aside and whispered: "No. 10 and No. 24 In a few buckets on both sides, the taste of the drinks is not bad, at least I personally like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter looked surprised and said, "Your Majesty... ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like a thank you," Roland chuckled. "If it weren’t for the group of businessmen you originally brought, maybe the West would have to It takes more than two or three years to get what it is today. Although at the beginning your purpose was not to do business with Bianbu Town, the town still benefited a lot, so this reward is nothing.” He paused, “Of course Only this time - after all, if you get a good hand every time, others will be suspicious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basics he said are basically In fact, the steam prototype at the time was both cumbersome and difficult to operate, and it could only be used for the simplest drainage and hauling work. There was not much sales in the West. Market. If she did not introduce it to the Yinguangcheng mineral merchants, thus opening up a high-profit business road, the original accumulation of the previous period may be even more difficult. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the sales area of ​​the Margaret Chamber of Commerce is the gray fort mainland, it is also a good choice to occupy the local market with the best taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will accept your thank you," the businesswoman did not make too many resignations - she is quite a bit thundering in dealing with others. Shadow, generous and generous, and at the same time informal. After a slight slap in the face of Roland, Margaret smiled and said, "Since I have received your gift, I can't give you any feedback. Let me tell you a good news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Roland picked a brow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first group of business groups you mentioned, my old friend Hogg, recently planned to visit the West." She lowered her voice, "but from According to his letter, this time it is not only that he came alone - the machines you sold have already spread in the central part of the kingdom, and now almost all the mine merchants are asking him about the rail transportation system. Maybe half a year later. Your factory has to be busy all day long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." Roland gave a slight glimpse, then smiled and nodded. "Look It’s indeed a good news to celebrate.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only he himself knows that when he heard the news, his heart suddenly burst into a heartfelt A sense of accomplishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day is finally here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two years, he has sold nearly a hundred steam engines, of which only 30% are in the kingdom. At the beginning of the establishment of the Grey Fort Industrial Company, the monthly output was only two or three pieces that were unbearable. Even if the demand of the territory itself was not met, he would still sell part of it to Silver City, which is expected to be this day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source of such a rare source of power is almost negligible for the industrial revolution, but it is a signal that once the manpower changes to the machinery, the production method is about to be reborn. signal. When everyone noticed the power of this new life and wanted to follow the chase, the change began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of interest-driven change is almost impossible to be blocked, and its effect is ten million times better than sipping and selling products everywhere. Enough to change the entire era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
