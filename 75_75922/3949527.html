			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the heavy snow of the Demon Moon, the Chishui River became the only road that can pass through the entire West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lionheart is much more spacious than the small sailboat that was used before, and can accommodate the next easy kitchen, even while on the road. You can eat hot food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His bedroom is naturally the independent single room of the Duke’s original residence, located at the stern, similar to the tower of a sea boat, through the window to see the river flowing under the foot and Floating ice that drifts from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, the egg soup you want," the knight sent the crock and porcelain bowl to his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Working hard," Pedro nodded. "You also sit down and drink a bowl, warm up."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the prince’s Highness has taken all the other four knights to Bianbu Town and told them not to accept the redemption, the first thing the nobles did was to send the knight’s family together. In the past, the vacated land either recruited new knights or simply ate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the honeysuckle family did not suffer too much loss in this war. Instead, it quickly grew stronger through the acting long-song fortress. Now it has stabilized and stabilized four people. Also has a relatively complete Cavaliers. The Knights of the side is a member of the team. Although it is not as household name as Xiaochen Chenguang, it is considered to be one of the younger Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," he smiled, uncovering the lid of the jar and pouring the soup for Pei. "But... is it really good for you to do this? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean a witch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, although the church was burned, But it is not difficult to build another one. The church will return to the West one day. You just have to push all the responsibilities to the Four Princes. They can't say anything. But you save the witch in front of the people and also the church. The believer gave it a hand..." The knight hesitated. "This is tantamount to being open to the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since building another one is not difficult, why is that place? Still in the ruins?” Pedro blew the fragrant egg soup. “The church will not return to the West.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seth winks, It seems that I don't quite believe this conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the egg soup is a little hot, he drank a small sip and satisfied his exhalation. "As a custodian, the most important thing is to comprehend." The true intention of the executive. His Royal Highness in the promotion of the fortress, the recruitment of the soldiers in the border town, and the play of the obvious drama, obviously to minimize the influence of the church. Since I was the manager of the fortress because of His Royal Highness Naturally, he must follow his meaning to govern the fortress. If he can't even see this point, I am afraid he will immediately replace me with others." Peero shrugged. "Do not let the church rebuild just a little effort - stonemasons and carpenters should accept When it comes to warning, even if there are believers who want to build their own, the mice will make these people unable to work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the church-"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the prince’s Highness has done this, it means that he will not fear the revenge of the church, or that he has the confidence to keep the church out, if they can still set foot in the West, Can only explain that His Highness failed. He lost I can't sit in the main seat of the fortress castle anymore. You should be able to understand this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think that the four princes can defeat the army of the church. ?? Seth is a strange way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who knows," Pedro smiled and shook his head. "A year ago, I was afraid that no one thought he could withstand the Knights of the Duke of Ryan. He got up and lifted the jar. "I went to see the little girl. She may be hungry too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl's name is white paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, only the vagrants will use such casual names. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since she got on the boat, she stayed in the cabin under the deck without saying anything, even if her fingers were red and her body shivered, she didn’t One sound. In order to be on the safe side, Pei Luo also gave her a lock on God's punishment. After all, how can the prophet raise the witch and the ordinary person, he will not fully believe that this person with incredible power will be like the ordinary people - even if It is an unintentional move that can cause harm to yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
