			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the caravan left, Roland took a long breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally... the vault is full again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a total of eight steam engines delivered to the three chambers of commerce, three of which were produced by the Chiwanwan Chamber of Commerce, which was built by the Chiwanwan Chamber of Commerce - I have to say that these come from The craftsmen of the fjord have much better talents and learning ability than the town's miners and blacksmiths. After mastering the machine tool operation, the passing rate of finished products will rise linearly. Maybe two months later, the production capacity of the No. 2 plant can catch up. No. 1 factory. Fortunately, according to the signed contract, the sales revenue of these machines is owned by Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, he also got a new hydrogen balloon purchase order from the Crescent Moon Bay caravan, and Marlan is very excited about this kind of thing that greatly expands his horizons. Interested, in addition to the single detection balloon, it also deliberately customized a giant balloon that can carry three to four people, intended to explore the new island of the fjord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the delivery of the first paddle steamer, the three have brought nearly 7,000 Jinlong’s income to Bianbu Town, and purchased metal ingots and washing The cost of commodities such as stone and grain, the remaining 6,000 Jinlong is enough to prop up his population expansion plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland called Barov and Iron Axe into the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a lot of money now, it’s time to go to the field to recruit more people." He looked at the two capable cadres, "this time by the City Hall In conjunction with the First Army, the specific personnel decide for yourself, I only account for the approximate task content."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You please say." The manager nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enrollment is divided into two directions, north and south." Roland pulled a map from the table and spread it in front of the two, "especially the eagle." From the city to the clear water port... I suspect that Tefko has regarded these people as a part of the Garcia forces, belonging to the useless population that can be spent at will, so you have to grab them first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The team sent by the City Hall is responsible for recruiting nobles, craftsmen and other literate, and the main task of the First Army is to recruit civilians. This is different from previous propaganda. This means should be more active. Do you understand what I mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe hesitated, "Do you mean... strong pull?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, there is no need to do that step," Roland coughed twice, and the style of the sand people was simple and rude, "for example, distributing food, actively persuading, paying living expenses in advance, etc." I took a look at Barov. "You should be very clear about this set."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& "Of course, Your Highness, I have assisted ministers and patrols in suppressing refugee riots many times during the time of Wang Du," the latter touched his beard. "Their demands are simple, sometimes just filling up the stomach." Only, so you don't need to use coins to get together, or even mention salary. If the conditions are too good, they will have doubts. It is a lot of trouble for the aristocrats. Although they are now in a tight position and no longer, they are knowledgeable and demanding. I don’t want to travel with us for a gimmick. At this time, I need money and promise to lure.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sat with two palms in satisfaction, “unfortunately There are so many things in Bianbu Town that you can't go in person, otherwise the task will be completed satisfactorily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest assured, Your Highness, I will send the most proud disciple Barov laughed. "When you build a city next year, you can have all the houses on both sides of the Chishui River."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be such a day." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people Back, Roland leaned back to rest for a moment, decided to go to the northern slope of the back yard and see Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the door, the first thing that comes into view is the metal block on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland picked up a piece in the palm of his hand - they are basically the same size, about five centimeters long and wide, the surface is not flat, like what was squeezed One of them is also engraved with a number. For example, the piece in his hand is imprinted with the words "256". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, is there any better discovery?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
