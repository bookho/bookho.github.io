			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Roland told Anna at the pillow about the daytime meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Considering the strength and stability of the devil's bullets, this special weapon may have to be further adjusted - found in power and practical applications Balance, this is only you can do it. Its priority is temporarily higher than other projects, during which I will let Andrea and Ai Gesha fully cooperate with you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I always feel that my life can never be done." Anna leaned her head on his shoulder. "The machine tool that can process aircraft parts, the improvement of the internal combustion engine, the front rails, and There are many items recorded in the book... I have some envy of Pasha and Serin. Although the black fire can be used as a hand, it is not as flexible as the tentacles, and the number of controls is very limited." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That can't be done, I don't want to sleep with a big sarcoma. And you are the chief of the engineering department, the queen of the gray castle, often The public appeared before." Roland laughed. He knows that Anna is not complaining, but sharing happiness with him. Since she took the initiative to serve as the engineering minister, her fascination has been enriched, and in front of others it is no longer the appearance of the former expressionless face. The only thing that hasn't changed is the initial seriousness. "Of course, I am also helping you find the right person. If everything goes well, the engineering department will soon be full."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the time to calculate, the Rex of the Wonder Club should have arrived at the fjord, that is, do not know whether the "buoyancy review" as a reward can attract the attention of those people. To know that the cake he painted at the end is in accordance with "Two Thousand Miles Under the Sea". For a "pre-inventor" who has not been exposed to the concept of science fiction, such a grand and magnificent idea can be regarded as the best resonate. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Anna stretched out and gently embraced him. "I will look forward to it. But now... I want some Other rewards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唔, it seems that there are more than one person to reward today, and Roland smiled in her heart and gently stroked her smooth back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Anna sat down, Roland closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he opened his eyes again, the ceiling has become the style of the soul building, and the morning sun is drilling into the room from the corner of the curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washing, eating breakfast, sending Jielu out, everything is the same as Peace Day. On the fence of the aisle, Roland is overlooking the crowded streets and alleys. The students carrying the schoolbags, the rushing office workers and the morning exercisers form a busy life scene, chaotic, but full of vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city still looks so peaceful, exactly the same as when it first entered here, but he knows that the world has changed - invisible to ordinary people There is a force in the place that is changing it, just as dreams have a sense of self. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory content that I have never seen before, the old red book, and the paper clips in the book are proof of change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since reading the book "The Reasons for Being", Roland has paid attention to the name of the Rose Cafe, but whether it is a web search or a witch The search did not get any clues. There are forty-six cafés in the city, and no one is called Rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not consider the possibility of mischief, but with the constant understanding of the real world, he found that the contents of the book became more and more difficult to ignore, even with the feeling of the note Also don't have a deep idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissidents that have completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the first outbreak of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awakening and erosion that cannot be stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this seems to be able to find the shadow in the real world, especially the discovery of the scene of the radio and the matchman, but also the content of the book is full of Visual sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is most puzzling is why books created in a dream world can correspond to reality, and they also use "the gods." The word "war". Unfortunately, according to Garcia, the author of this book did not leave any information, and the only breakthrough seemed to be the only piece of paper left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
