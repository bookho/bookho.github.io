			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy fleet approached the Chishui River ramp for half a day longer than expected, until the afternoon of the fourth day, ten sailboats slowly appeared at the end of the field of vision. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanner received the message through six compartments in turn, issued a preliminary order to the gun group he was responsible for, and then returned to his own gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the enemy?" Rodney picked up the window baffle and looked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least a few hundred meters away from us," the cat's claws responsible for observing the signal flag shouted at the sky window, "I am even with them here." The shadows are not visible, and there are too many weeds on the roof."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the shooting window, each compartment is also open at the top against the wall. Holes. You can easily see the situation on the Chishui River by climbing the two-story stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking of weeds, the ability of the green-haired witch is incredible," the pomelo peel wiped some rusty cannonballs, "where she went." The thin grass is as long as the hair, and the bunkers are tightly covered and look just like ordinary earthen bags."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? The green-haired witch," Fanna yelled. "That is Miss Yeh. When she first confronted the Dukes of the Duke, she helped us to bury the vines in the woods on both sides, so that the knight could not bypass. Otherwise the cans passed It’s enough for us to get through the woods.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Which witch is more common than the magic?” Rodney shrugged. “One night The structure builds a bunker, allows vines and weeds to cover the ground, can fly freely in the sky, and even change into a huge pigeon – these are not things that mortals can do.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most amazing thing I still choose Miss Nana," the cat's claws are full of 憧And look forward to, "I don't know if this will be glorious and hurt. If I get hurt, I can see her at a close distance, and maybe I can still hear her comfort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me a good look at the enemy!" Fanna frowned and said, "Don't dare to talk nonsense, I will punish you to go back to the toilet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cat The claw spit out the tongue and probed the body out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artillery captain sighed in his heart, and now these guys have lost their sense of tension and will never be as shivering as they were on the battlefield a few months ago. . He can't say whether this change is good or bad. He always feels that he is too contemptuous of his opponent, but he can't sternly blame his men because he can't go anywhere. Since he became a soldier under the Highness, Vanner's understanding of the battle has taken place. Earth-shaking changes: bloody and brutal fights seem to have nothing to do with strength, skill, and courage. They only need to repeat the steps they have memorized during training, prepare for the charter, meet the enemy according to the charter, and fire according to the charter to win. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially in the town against the new king’s militia, it’s obvious that the opponent is strenuous, and the humanoid beast is not afraid of death, but the battle lasts only half. The hour is over. When he cleaned the battlefield, he discovered that he had no sense of fatigue. It seemed that he had just done a warm-up exercise before training, and the enemy had already collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this development, will there be a day when the battle will become impossible to see even the enemy's face, just operate these metal machines, you will be able to annihilate the enemy A thousand miles away? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Fanna was thinking about it, the warning of the cat's claw pulled him back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw the enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Filling ammunition!" Head, throwing distracting thoughts behind his head, and screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compartment was busy all the time. This step has been practiced too many times. Now everyone can put the medicine bag and the shell into the cannon with their eyes closed. The gun can be fired once in a twenty-second period without regard to resetting and adjusting the angle of incidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle plan set by His Royal Highness Roland and the Iron Axe is always well-followed - similar to the defense battle in Bianyan Town, waiting for the observer to see the red flag of Miss Flash Only then can the camouflage baffle in front of the gun window be pushed down and fired. The nearest No. 1 and No. 2 guns from the river bank used a bomb to sweep the deck, while the other guns bombarded the cabin with solid bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
