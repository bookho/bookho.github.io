			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the mystery hurriedly ran into the office, and the dark circles on his face expanded a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is the glass lit up? After that, I didn’t respond to how I used it..." She just slammed the door and she couldn’t wait to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it so fast?" His Royal Highness looked a little surprised. He put down the quill and took the little toy in the hands of the mystery. "I thought you wanted It took two or three days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystery month slammed his toes and hung his chin on the edge of the table, blinking and asking: "What is the radiance?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s an electric light," sire laughed. "You released the thunder in the sky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ray...hey?" She couldn't help but whispered repeatedly, then shook her head. "But it doesn't look like it. The light is orange-red and it keeps shining - it's just a flash of lightning." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lightning ignited the filament, causing it to continually shine," the prince squeezed the glass ball twice and took it down. "No." It doesn't matter if you understand it, then I will let you see the real electric light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystery Moon eyes wide open, staring at each other's every move, raw What missed. I saw him put the two copper wires close together and then screwed the glass ball back. "Well, keep going to practice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it?" She took the wireframe and was disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," the prince covered his mouth. "Remember to pull the curtains during this exercise."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the mystery returned to the bedroom, Lily was sitting on the bed and looking at the "Theory of Natural Science." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you get up so early today?" she looked unexpectedly. "Since I got up, I will help me bring a breakfast back. I want to fry the eggs." And bread, don't want porridge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't go, I won't bring breakfast to the traitors," the mystery snorted and reached for the thick floor curtains. Closing, the room suddenly became dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what are you going to do?" Lily frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Practicing ability," she sat down on the floor, "bringing up the curtains and collecting the glowing stones - this is the request of His Royal Highness."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s OK," the little girl rolled her eyes. "I went to the lobby to read."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No!" Mystery month high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Lily glanced at her. "I can't read the book now, and I am hungry. Do I have to stay with you here?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Mystery month, "I am going to bring you breakfast, can you stay here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How," Lily asked with great interest, "Are you afraid of black?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not!" I whipped up my cheeks, and after a while I whispered, "I just want someone to accompany me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants others to see their progress, I want others to marvel at their abilities. If they fail, they hope that someone can comfort them. But if they kill, they will not say to Lily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, listen to your pitiful tone, I will reluctantly promise you once," the latter yawned, "breakfast, hurry." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately after ransacks, the mystery month was finally ready for practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?" Lily smugly chewed the egg and asked, "Is magneticity in the hands?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lily couldn't help but sigh, "Thunder?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I started--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait," the little girl shouted, and moved her body to the door. "Now, you can show your ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystery Exhale the gas and follow the previous practice to run the magic. If this scene takes place in the co-help camp, the instructor Hakala will come over and swear by her actions, and in order to facilitate her practice, His Highness will deliberately replace the iron-containing utensils in the bedroom, including the nails, with copper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the experience they have experienced in Bianbu Town, she is even more reluctant to accept her own inaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pictures in my mind emerged one by one, like a lantern, this time she found that she entered the state very quickly, the magic jumped between her hands, the speed The faster you come, the stronger your strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a mystery month to see the electric light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the blue ghost that appeared in the clouds, the light was short and disappeared, but at that moment, she clearly saw the trajectory of the electro-optic operation— - Like a small arc, jumping from the copper line to the other end, while making a slight hum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is far from over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is the second, third... She was surprised to find that every time the magnetic transformation, you can see the eye-catching electric light hopping, the trajectory is also In response, the same change has taken place. With the rapid switching of the magnetic direction, a blue-white bridge was gradually connected between the two copper wires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Lily, standing in the distance, couldn't help but widen her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with yesterday’s orange-red light, this electric light is insignificant, but the mysterious moon’s heart is shaking – she first saw her ability! The rhythm and direction of the arc beating is completely under her control, compared to the magnetic lines that can't be seen and can't be traced. This is indeed the "Thunder" she created. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electrical magnetism, magnetoelectricity, it turned out to be the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels that the power in her body has become clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystery stood up and set the metal frame on the table, slowly loosening his hands, the magic subsided, but the ends of the copper wire still shimmered, far Looking far away, it is like a star in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She now has a deeper understanding of these words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, electricity is magnetic, magnetic is electricity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Roland bit the quill in his mouth and rubbed some sore neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Need me to help?" The words of the nightingale came from the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, trouble," he nodded lightly, then a pair of hands on his shoulders, and pressed it just right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland closed his eyes slightly and enjoyed the silence of this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first law of the town, and the basic law of the future as the main law, he even started earlier than the guards in these three days until Today is the completion of writing - because the law is ignorant, he can only use his dry words to piece together more than ten pieces of content according to his own understanding of the system, adding up to less than two pages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it already contains the ideas of the new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is completely different from the ancient system of separation, and he believes that this law will, along with his territory, push the new system to the entire continent, using it as Foundation, the new kingdom will inevitably emit a very different brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness!" The door of the office was suddenly pushed open, and the mystery month ran with a copper wire frame. "I finally understood!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
