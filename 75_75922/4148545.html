			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fort, no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, Wendy walked into Roland’s office with a test record of two new witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to say, your majesty, their abilities are... very complicated," she said in a report. "I am still in the first place in a position. Seeing so many variables. This is only part of it. If you want to fully understand it, you may have to wait a few more days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Roland puts the work at hand with interest and quickly browses the report. "In this case, should Tachilla be interested?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wen Tidy nodded. "They let Felice conduct the test of the winners in the first place. Unfortunately, the light beams of the two people are not significant, and the requirements for the "key" of the sacred instrument are much worse. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the news, Roland was relieved. He just made a plan to power up the city, and all the magic cores are also moving toward the shape of the mysterious instrument." Transformation, if suddenly a natural person chooses, Catherine will certainly be full of resentment - after all, it takes decades to adjust from the ordinary core to the sacred mode, and it is certainly not a pleasant experience to stay in front of the core every day.<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the gossip of honey, these high-level witches of Takira seem to have been fascinated by the "sunbathing" recently, not the kind of lying in the midday sun. Sun, but climb out of the cave at night, until the sunrise. Because the strong light will cause damage to the carrier, they should not like to go out, even though Roland does not understand what Pasha and others do. But at least one thing can be seen that their recent mentality is quite relaxed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good sign.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland soon turned the notebook to the end.<兰 < br br br br br br br br The size and the magic of the input.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test results show that the "potions" can interfere with the emotions far more than joy and pain, drowsiness, exhaustion, anxiety, fear... ...as long as it is a human experience, it can affect it more or less. When the potency effect ends, these accumulated emotions will erupt at once.<br /><br />&nbsp Roland probably understands why the potion effect is extremely complex, and the light column is commonplace - in a sense, it is equivalent to a nerve blocker that temporarily conducts nerves and The time of hormone production has been delayed a bit. Some drugs in the future can do this, but the side effects are extremely large, and it is easy to produce dependence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course , the light column is simple or not and cannot be measured The value of the ability, if you take Dailan's "potions" to another world to sell, its effectiveness and profit prospects will definitely make all the pharmaceutical giants feel jealous.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp A variety of mental illnesses are far more complicated and more difficult to cure than the visible internal and external injuries. Although it can not eliminate the symptoms, it can be accurately delayed, as long as it is properly controlled, the impact of the disease can be reduced. To the lowest. Negative states such as anxiety and exhaustion are mainly hindered by people's daily life. If they are postponed until they fall asleep, they can “stablely digest” without knowing it. Once people are no longer troubled by upsets and insomnia, the body's self-healing speed will increase a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even if it is a life-threatening serious injury, the role of the potion can not be underestimated. In the face of severe pain, people tend to be distracted, and it is difficult to make effective emergency measures, so that they miss the golden time of rescue. If you can give yourself first aid, or insist on the arrival of medical staff, the survival rate will be much higher. After the rescuer only needs to prepare for the severe pain, he can help the injured person to survive the most difficult part of the initial period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, there is more than one witch who has the ability to deal with the illness. Roland remembers that the sister mentioned that there is a witch named Jura on the island, which can eliminate the pain. There are also heroes of the Witch Alliance who can transfer non-traumatic illnesses to other living things. Although it is not clear whether they can transfer mentally negative symptoms, it is worth a try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is that if there is no Dylan's potion, their role will be difficult to play effectively - soldiers on the battlefield may be hit hard at any time, but the witches are separated Lack of surgery. In fact, many of the first-time soldiers were killed because they lost consciousness after the injury. They were not able to get treatment in the first place and eventually died on the way to the hospital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
