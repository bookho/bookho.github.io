			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth place is Sylvie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this witch, Roland always felt a little uncomfortable, not because the nightingale said that she had too many lies, in modern society, except for loved ones and good Friends, few people will be outspoken, all kinds of toads and rumors of special effects, he has long been accustomed to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just feels that he has a feeling of nowhere to hide in front of her. What’s worse, he knows that this is not an illusion, but that the other’s ability is in this way. Ignore the visuals of the obstacles, as long as she thinks, the clothes on her body are equal. Roland sighed why he didn't have such ability, and he couldn't help but change his sitting position and lifted his legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the appearance, she is the most chic of the five witches: a greenish long hair straight shoulders, slender eyebrows, under Qi Liuhai If it happens. Especially her amber eyes, transparent, almost no depth, as if reflecting all the light in a mirror. After watching it for a long time, Roland always felt that there was a red mark in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver’s ability is very well understood, she can see all the sights in the whole body – behind it is no exception, and the vision can penetrate obstacles, How deep the specific penetration depends on her thoughts. In addition, she also has a branching ability similar to the nightingale: you can see the convergence and dissipation of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Roland feel a little surprised, if the branching ability can be so close, then the main ability? He asked Hilli about the problem, and the latter hesitated, saying that among the hundreds of witches on the island, they did not find the same ability. The nightingale on the left side verified this sentence as the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s probably because there are too few samples, Roland thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last witch who appeared was a candlelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, like Anna, ushered in her adult day in the last year of the Demon Moon. In underage, her ability can only be applied to lighting such as candles, lamp oil, torches, etc. The magic power is stabilized in adulthood, and the effect is greatly enhanced. The exposed objects can be maintained for a certain period of time - for example, After the ice is applied, it will not melt under the sun, and it will still burst into a cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability at first glance seems incredible, and can be done by many conventional means, but after several rounds of testing, Roland found that it was not as perfect as imagined. First of all, it is a kind of enchanting ability, which needs to be in direct contact with the target. This limitation makes it difficult for the candle to solidify some high temperature objects. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he tried to get a drop of molten steel that was always in the incandescent state, and the plan to provide a source of heat for the blast furnace was gone, except for Anna, no one dared to use his hand. Go and touch thousands of things. When it becomes a thin wire, the candle can hold the other end for enchantment, but this raises another problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the object is solidified from the normal state, the greater the magical power consumption, and the shorter the sustained effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland verifies this with ice cubes - the same size of ice cubes are solidified, one on the hot ground, one into the basin, The former only melted for half an hour, while the latter cooled the water temperature to a cold shape and still maintained its original shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that if you switch to red hot wire or steel bars, the effect will only be worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, volume is also a factor that restricts the ability of candlelight. Like hummingbirds and mystery, the larger the volume of the object, the more magic it consumes. According to the observation of the nightingale, her own magic is at the middle and lower level, like a golden mist, and has not yet formed a strong cyclone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even so, this seemingly introverted girl is still Roland’s biggest achievement - in the field of industrial production, the state of solidified objects is completely invaluable. The key is the word "normal". Under the influence of heating, cooling, friction, and force, the metal will be fatigued and the structure will be deformed. He doesn't need a bit that gets hot due to friction, and he doesn't need to wear gears that are getting worn out. If a key part of a machine can be kept in a normal state, it means it can always operate at maximum efficiency and with the highest precision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the ignition can effectively improve the mechanical strength of inferior metals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
