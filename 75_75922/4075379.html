			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Garcia, Roland returned to his apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis is sitting in the living room waiting for him, "Your Majesty, that person was..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The magical awakened person of this world, who claims to be a martial artist," he waved his hand. "You don't need to mind her attitude. No one in the dream world knows my true identity except you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But she is what you created after all..." Felice still seems a little sorrowful, since she promised her request, after taking her experience to relive the food, the ancient witch The respect for Roland has become very different from before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not the case in their eyes--people here have complete memories and thoughts, from birth to death, nothing to do with me. Even the whole world has With his own rules," Roland sat down opposite her and bluntly said, "For now, I am also part of the rules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the world, Felice immediately burst into a dazzling brilliance in her eyes. What she saw and heard along the way brought her an indescribable shock. It is not easy to endure it now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She first looked at the room of Jingluo, and then lowered her voice and asked, "Your Majesty, is this the place you used to live? Please excuse me, The four princes of the Grey Fort Kingdom are just your nephew, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s brow could not help but jump, “Why do you say that?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because your winter city is like this too!" Felice said excitedly. "I didn't quite understand when I first arrived here. Why is it just that the road is running a carriage, but it is It’s so spacious and flat, even in a city with limited space... Now that you know that you are not prepared for the carriage, those four-wheelers that come and go like the wind are your goal!” She paused "There are machines that boil water and endless power, buildings that claim to build ten floors, weapons that are amazingly powerful, etc... The reason why this city will become what it is today is related to that world. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am indeed the Four Princes, just arriving When I was in town, there was a bit more memory in my head.” Roland thought about it and decided to hide the thing that happened. After all, this secret he hoped that only the most intimate witch knew, “It contains the most profound and incredible. Knowledge, and I only have a small part of it now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So it must be something that God has given you," Felice did not have to him. There is a slight suspicion in the statement. "The Takira witch often said that the gods do not love human beings, but now it seems that we may be wrong, you have got a smile of the gods - as long as you are there, we will be able to defeat the devil!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was Roland’s surprise. He had always wanted the Tacula survivors to believe this, but when the other party said so arbitrarily, he Some are not practical, after all, he took her to the parks and restaurants, not the scene of military exercises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he euphemistically asked the doubts in his heart, Felice answered very cheerfully, "because of the four-wheeled cars that come and go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Car?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty. In the era of Tacharia, if we want to The transportation of war preparations to the outpost camp requires the use of a large number of horses and vehicles. Although not the witches have the ability to move quickly, they cannot carry too much heavy things. Once the load exceeds a certain limit, the speed of magic consumption will multiply. You should be clear about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So when the federation seized the devil's siege beast, everyone felt great pressure - just A witch can drive a hundred times the weight of his body. If you remove the iron shield and arrow, and only use it to transport supplies, a siege beast can be worth four or five carriages. From this point Judging from it, the devil’s mastery and use of magic is much higher than that of us. Broken, the enemy's war potential is even better than the witch. It is based on this conclusion that the Akalis talents pin their hopes on the Gods Penalty Plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Use transport capacity to judge strength?" Roland asked with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice nodded, "From the human burden to the carriage towing, it determines the range we can reach, no doubt, the farther the race goes The stronger it is." She said that she couldn't help but raise her mouth. "In the dream world, those four-wheeled iron cars with several times the length of the carriage can still run easily with nearly 100 people. This is enough to prove the power of the dream world. If your weapon is also from this, then it will certainly defeat the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
