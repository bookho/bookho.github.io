			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland walked into the port surrounded by the Guards, two San Francisco ships carrying black and white two-tone faucet flags were unloading. The officials of the city hall stood around the piled wooden boxes and made an exclamation from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long time no see, sire," Margaret quickly greeted him, smiled and made a movement to him. "Please Forgive me for seeing you in this way... It’s really not suitable for wearing a long skirt at sea, and I hope you don’t mind.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her side A man followed his chest and bowed his way. "Your, Sander. Bird from Ssangyong Island pays tribute to you - don't know if my costume will satisfy you?" He squinted and said, "Should be Is the word "Gaoxiang's seabirds" very relevant? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, before he spoke, Roland had noticed this conspicuous dress, saying that a humanoid shape full of feathers would not let people It’s difficult to look at the side. The costumes are ordinary fjord sea merchants, but from the headscarves wrapped around the head to the soft shoes covered under the feet, the tassels of bird feathers can be seen everywhere. After a long journey, many The feathers have turned into bare poles, and even those decorations that are still hanging on the clothes have lost their original luster, and they can’t help but think of the word chicken.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No... you misunderstood," Roland said, "Sand. Bird" in his heart is just a very common blue icon, any same-sex and a few of his age. The opposite sex has an experience that can't wait to open it. "Although you don't want lightning to be recognized, I bet you will enter the castle with this look. It will be stared at by her inseparable partner, Mai Hao. That's the case, even if the face is fake. Beard, I’m afraid it’s hard to hide the past.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ha ha ha... is it?” Thunder laughed heartily. “It’s a pity, I’m quite I am satisfied with this dress. You don’t know, since I have found a set of tailors, I’ve become popular on several islands.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Is this the power of the example? Roland silently rolled his eyes, and the other side is not the most outstanding explorer in the fjord. He is almost forty years old, and he can maintain such a young mind. For other people, I am afraid that it will not be made for a temporary The name is so tossing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything must start with the letter before the expedition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the completion of the steel ship, the next step should be the trial phase. Roland is so far away from the unpredictable sea, and he knows what level of the first iron ship he designed. There is no doubt that even if the equipment and functional areas are cut, it is a real finished product. There is still a long distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a pile of iron that can float up and move forward and backward even if it is a qualified sea boat. Under the bumps of the waves, the working environment of the hull machinery is very different from that of the inland watercraft. With the first use of the steam turbine, the reliability of the entire power system is still a question, and it is not surprising that the anchor is broken out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more headache is that he has no control over the handling of the ship, or the human-computer interaction part - he has difficulties in mechanical principle, he also You can go to the dream world to find a solution, but how to open a specific ship, before the electronic aid system is not popular, I am afraid that it is an answer to a type of ship. There is no other way than to explore it yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So inviting the Thunder to try it in person is the best option he can think of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is not only an experienced navigator, but also a leader of the expedition team. The outstanding sailors are hundreds of people, and their feedback is inevitable. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland intends to use this opportunity to test and adjust and record all the data when the vessel is sailing. As a result, there will undoubtedly be a leap forward when the next sea boat starts. And these data will also be a valuable asset for the winter-free manufacturing industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this link may take two or three months, it is necessary for the Thunder to stay in the winter city for a while. In order not to reveal his identity, Roland made up a false identity in his letter, which is Sander. Unexpectedly, he not only accepted it with pleasure, but also added a set of settings to this identity. The spirit of the game made the king of the gray castle stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty, have you really completed the construction of the steamship so soon?" Thunder changed the subject, "In the fjord, even if it is The best craftsmen, plus the most suitable materials, will take several years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
