			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland walked into the office, he accidentally discovered that the night was not in the house, but Wendy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" He poured himself a cup of warm water, "What about night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"She went to meet the sisters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Roland picked up the cup and was about to take a sip, and suddenly felt something was wrong." Wait, what sister?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sisters of the co-helpers, they came to the town," Wendy replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are they not looking for the holy mountain?" He stood up fiercely. "How many people are there? The one who wants to hurt the nightingale... seems to be called The snake devil Hakala, did she come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Your Highness...they didn't find the holy mountain. In the wilderness, they suffered terrible The monsters, only seven people survived.” Wendy repeated the narrative of the leaves, and then apologized. “At the time you were still taking a nap, please forgive me for making a claim, letting the nightingale and lightning pick them up. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Roland waved his hand. "You know that I won't blame you for this. What are their abilities?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, but listen to the leaves, they are not witches of the fighting type, maybe..." Wendy hesitated, "not too much for you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Non-combat type?" Roland’s heart was filled with anticipation, the stone of punishment and the role Constraints from the witch's fighting ability is very limited actual production is the field they do best. If there is a witch who specializes in plasticity, he can solve the problem of rough processing and directly enter the era of mechanical production. If there is a witch who can generate electricity, Bianyi Town will also be like a night. Next, I will be the king, marry the witch, go to the peak of life, and lead everyone to realize the four modernizations. It is exciting to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, you don't need them..." Perhaps it was a long silence that worried Wendy, she whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, how come," Roland said, coming back and saying, "How much does this witch come from?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the occasion of the setting sun, the nightingale returned to the castle with the rest of the co-operative sisters, and Roland prepared a sumptuous dinner in the castle hall as a dust-washing feast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witches are obviously starving, but for the first time in this environment, everyone is very cautious. Most people still see the lord for the first time, not to mention the lord is a prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, in addition to Roland himself, there are two local witches, Anna and Nana, to demonstrate, plus I don’t know why the lightning activity is active, everyone finally Finally, I let go of the point and there was a conversation at the banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland chewed the toasted bread, while looking at the crowd in front of this group of different styles, but they are considered beautiful women. This is the greatness of magic – even if the technology develops without the intervention of witches, their appearance is also a never-ending landscape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The model community built by Carl has not yet been completed, and the witches can only live in the castle for the time being. There are still four rooms available on the second floor. Roland considered it and decided to change the single-person housing to a double. After all, those big beds are prepared for visiting nobles, and they can fully accommodate two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the dinner, the prince finally ushered in the long-awaited link - ability to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women take turns to enter the office with the nightingale, Roland is like an interviewer, recording each of their characteristics, and at the same time using the gods for the first time Stone to test the effectiveness of the effect, the entire process is like a job fair. When the last witch's inquiry was completed, he spit out a sigh of relief and stretched a long stretch. If you are not afraid that the nightingale may be eavesdropping on the side, he really wants to beheaded Super-star. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no witch who specializes in shaping and generating electricity, the progress of modernization will be slowed down, but the witches still bring to Roland A full surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
