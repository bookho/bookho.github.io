			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By borrowing, borrowing, troubles let it go!" Manfred squeezed into the crowd and immediately caught the attention of the group of refugees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is this guy?" Someone stopped in front of him with a look of disappointment. "Even if you can't stop it, you have to wait for Laozi to cool off before you say it?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was this person who started to laugh at him. He thought his mind was sharp, and it seemed that the other party was the leader of this group. It is unlikely that you will take away the woman in front of a dozen gangsters. If you don’t have any weapons, the only chance is that you will only let the leader take the lead and then leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am here to remind you all, just now someone has been there to inform the black guards. You are not running now, you will not be there until later. Manfard spread his hands and pretended to be calm and walked into the other two steps. At the same time, he secretly looked at the woman, hoping she could understand that she and the gangsters were not all the way. However, the latter not only did not make any representation, but turned slightly over the head, revealing a confused look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, does this guy still don’t understand his situation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are you here, can you still be so calm? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What black guards, isn't it a patrol?" The first one opened his mouth in a hazy voice. "Who will help them?" This kid should be a young boy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha, look at his appearance, probably from a big family."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The result is not the same as us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The point of understanding is faster, the boss is still Didn't get angry -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哄 laughter suddenly appeared, and at this moment, Manfred started. He slammed his shoulders and slammed into the chest of the deliberately worried head, then turned his fists and knocked the other side to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that these gangsters have to deal with more than the two well-trained attendants of Mai Jinli. From the start of his hand to the fall, the leader did not even scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd suddenly lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom, you are looking for death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help the boss!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manfred immediately felt his back and legs squatted a few times, but he couldn’t care so much now, half-blocking his head and reaching out to the woman, "Follow I am coming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected things happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman did hand it over, but instead of putting it in his palm, he grabbed his wrist and then pulled him into the encirclement. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you..." Manfred was trying to question the other person if he had made a mistake, but he saw the electric light that jumped on the woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc...Electric light? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not recovered, the tiny electric light has turned into an electric arc, and the blue light suddenly rises like a long snake. The mix, like the skewers, runs through them one by one. In the face of such an incredible scene, the perpetrators had almost no resistance, and only when they had a short scream, they fell to the ground and stiffly fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is all right." The woman clap her hands and said easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...do you..." Manfred stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am a witch." The other party admitted his identity very calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can...the witches should not be beautiful, arrogant, and full of charms in every move? The woman he looked at in a moment, the feelings he got were completely inextricably linked to these descriptions. The appearance is not mentioned, the plain is not a kind of praise; the body shape is quite thin, if you only look at the back, it is no different from the little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will contact the police department to deal with the aftermath. - Rest assured, I only use about 10% of the power, let them stun for up to half an hour. But the mine and the kiln area is not expected to put it so easily. Going them, I think I have to wait at least ten days and a half to come out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manfred found that he couldn’t keep up with her words. The content is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you listen to her tone, this conflict is like a planned thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, my name is Xue Lun, can you tell me your name?" The woman’s question interrupted his thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, Manfred..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are my first to see To the person who came out of the initiative, why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why why," Manfred smashed the part that was kicked, "It is not a matter of course to prevent sin from happening." Is it something? I just didn't think you didn't need help at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course?" Xuelun grinned. "If everyone thinks so, previously Those who are guilty will not run without a trace now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there will always be someone who understands this." In history books, the nobility is The transformation of such people has brought order to the chaotic world and opened the way in the thorns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak well, there are always people who know right and wrong." Xuelun laughed. "You are a migrant who has just come to no winter? Are there any future?" The idea to join the police department?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you mean...become a black man?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, fighting crime, maintaining order, and protecting residents is the main responsibility of the police. I think this work may be suitable for you. In addition, they may not always wear black clothes, for example, now." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" Manfred said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I have to go to the Executive Office to report, the receptionist is still waiting for you." Xuelun waved and turned and walked toward the inner city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know now, why don't I let you go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the team After that, Matt smiled at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... What the hell is going on?" Manfred looked puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An effective way to deter crime." Matt explained as he walked. "The temporary residential area in the suburbs was not so confused, at least I lived." This is the case. But since the migration has been repeated several times, the level of public security has been seriously degraded, and among all crimes, the atrocities against vulnerable women are most prominent. Of course, I am not saying that the mistake lies in you, because there are also Many migrants who have moved from all over the Grey Fort. Because there are so many people, it is very difficult for the police to take care of them. It is very important that the police report the incident once it happens. The criminals are likely to have been created when the rushed. Unrecoverable damage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't this obvious? Put a lot of dregs together, and the best places will become smoky." Someone muttered "In my opinion, the king of the Grey Fortress should not accept these unidentified people at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt shakes his head, "Your hope is that anyone Can come in handy - special In the face of the battle of God, but this idea is not from the majesty, but the witches offered it. For them, this can not only consume magic, spend space time, but also maintain law and order, no doubt it is two birds with one stone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play... Send free time? Manfred couldn't help but pump his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The facts also prove that this trick is very effective, and any seemingly weak refugees are likely to launch a fatal counterattack, enough to make those who are on the rise to dispel their thoughts. The police department will never let go of a criminal, and the recidivist will consider the cost again and again. After the joint rectification, the security here is much better than the worst."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
