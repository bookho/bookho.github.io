			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning and wheat stubble landed slowly on the roof of the Witch Building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After closing the door of the corridor, the whistling wind converges a lot, leaving only a few snorings coming in from the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call, the hair is soaked," the pigeon shakes the snow that sticks to his body and reshapes it into a human form. The wings swelled to the sides and eventually turned into her long, bare feet. It seems that it looks very soft and soft to the touch. The girl's hair will not be blown into the wind by the wind, but wrapped her like a scorpion, like a cotton ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But due to the wetness of the snow, her hair looked a little dim and lost the fluffy feeling at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you should take a shower first, so as not to catch cold." Lightning took off the windbreaker and looked out the door - the climate of the demon moon is This is impermanent. Just now there was only a small amount of snow falling. Now it is snow and ice. The world is full of palm-sized snow flakes. Restorative training has to be temporarily suspended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you wash with me?" Mai Mai was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Under the armpits, the wound should be as dry as possible, not touching the water source?" Lightning shrugged. "So I wipe it with hot water, anyway. This jacket will not let the snow come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out!" She plucked the bangs stuck in front of her face and licked her mouth to reveal a white tooth. "That will help you to clean it after washing. Before the ashes, I often boast that I am very comfortable, I don't need a towel!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃... How is that stunned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey like this," she grabbed two long hairs and made a circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I refused." Lightning rolled his eyes. "If it's a towel, I can still think about it - in short, go quickly."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the stalks rushed to the castle with a bath, the lightning returned to walk alone Into the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the door closed, she leaned against the door panel and extended her right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, the fingertips still trembled uncontrollably, as if they were not under her control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She could not help but reveal a bitter smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you close your eyes, there will always be a scene in which the devil will catch her. After these days of recovery, the fear does not leave her. It was the root of her heart - this situation was the first time lightning was encountered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether facing Luo Lan’s squats or the expedition’s partners, she tried her best to pretend to be a relaxed appearance of “this little injury is no big deal”. And only discussing the injury, even the nightingale can not detect her strange. But in fact, only she knows how bad her situation is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let McMug go to the bath alone, but also afraid that the other side can see this - see how vulnerable the surreal explorer is. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning sits a little on the ground and buryes his head in the knee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Felice comforted her, the enemy is likely to have the ability to be similar to the fear of the demon, can look at the fear through the eyes, but she knows that this does not become An excuse. The witch has a higher resistance to the mental influence itself, not to mention that it has been so long. McMug was also within the influence of the other party, but her watch was actually winning too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you just fear it, nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not the first time to be afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear comes from the unknown, unless people can do everything they know, or they can't avoid fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is to be afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this time, the lightning found that there was only one empty piece in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't say resistance, the situation at the time was even reluctant to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today’s recovery training is always in the east without the winter city, without crossing the wall, not because of ability or physical reasons, but because she is not seen The snowy field at the bottom created fear - the earth beneath it seemed to be a thousand cliffs, and the edge of the sky was like a swallow. Just looking into the distance, she can feel the tremor from the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not lost to the magic of the devil, but is shocked by the evil and power of the other, just like the prey of the predator, this fear is more than magic The impact was even more serious and even hindered her flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning hugged his knees tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the head of the expedition, she is just a coward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if the Thunder is still around her? For him who has crossed countless dangerous seas, is there a way to deal with this situation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn't help but whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;********* **********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The southern section of the Lost Forest, Sen zero site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the starting point for the wild railway line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the successful development of the steam train, no winter city will have a significant improvement in the development of the forest - from wood to food, even near the snowy mountains Coal mines are already included in the new route planning program. In the coming year, this vast and flamboyant forest with wild animals and wild animals will become a real treasure house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the railway is still built for one purpose only. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area around the station has been blocked by the First Army, waiting for his Majesty’s testing of new weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe is naturally one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still remembers the situation when he followed his Majesty’s participation in the black powder test four years ago. At that time, he was only a negligible hunter, and he also used gunpowder as a punishment. the fire. The roar of the sky seemed to open a door that he had never seen before, and from that day on, his fate changed dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now as the commander of the First Army of the Grey Fort, the Iron Axe will naturally not participate passively in the experiment as before. He already knew what he was going to face today—in fact, it was not a real “new” weapon. Its two main parts: artillery and trains, have been revealed in front of everyone. It must be impossible to talk about. Because of this, he believes that this test can finally be taken away and surprised to spend more calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a heavy minister of Roland after all, and he should be calm at all times, even if he is facing the fire of the thunder, he must smile, just like himself. That way...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the whistle rang, the new weapon slowly emerged from the garage, and the iron axe found himself wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train is completely out of shape when it was first seen - it is surrounded by dark steel plates, only the half of the wheel below, the outline Founder, arrogant and angular, from the front to give a strong sense of oppression, and the surrounding snow scene in sharp contrast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is by no means a good class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as you look at it, you will understand this truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
