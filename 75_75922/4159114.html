			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All senior executives clearly saw the enemy's defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is a storm on the island, or looking around for a breakthrough, the devil is not allowed to enter. In the precision strike of Eleanor, they will bring huge risks every minute they stay. Such high casualty efficiency is absolutely unacceptable for the beastly army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying means fast, fast, and free from terrain. The beast has ruled the sky for hundreds of years and has absolute initiative on the battlefield. But now I am afraid that they have not thought of it, they will lose more than half if they have not seen their opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been devils who have turned around and retreated... or fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the opportunity for humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core goal of the B program is to exchange the biggest results at the lowest price, and winning the pursuit has always been a great opportunity to expand the results - this is not A novel idea, but only the Eleanor floating island can seamlessly switch between offense and defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the most significant difference between an empty mother ship and other carrier platforms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Tillyâ€™s instructions, the command post immediately followed the appropriate procedures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pipeline pressure is completed, the various steam pressure indicators are normal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zero 1 And the zero-sixth door is about to open, and is now on the runway!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ground report also takes five minutes to prepare."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first batch of attackers are all in place!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the large vertical size of the floating island, the hangar itself has a takeoff The runway, which is centered on the warehouse, is scattered in the lower surface of the earth's surface. These internal runways are tightly separated by several thick protective doors before they are activated, and only the steam engine can open them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the length of each runway has dropped significantly, it is only about one-third of the ground take-off and landing field, but it is enough for a fluttering biplane. It doesn't matter if you don't get enough initial speed, the height difference between the floating island and the ground is enough for the heavy aircraft to pull up the nose again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you go in person?" Roland looked at Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This rare opportunity for actual combat, let the newcomers practice more." The latter smiled and then grabbed the microphone. "After the door is opened, Immediate attack, goal - one does not stay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Goode is no longer The first time I started from the library runway, but the previous ones were just exercises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally understood why His Highness repeatedly emphasized the need to wear earmuffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 50 biplanes in the enclosed space start the engine at the same time, and the roar can be described as thrilling. Even if they are separated by two or three meters, the cockroaches of the ground and the big door can only see the mouth shape, but they can't hear the human voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the moment the preparation command is issued, all communication of the Air Knight can only be done by flags and gestures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first slipped into the runway and entered the takeoff position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gushing steam, the iron gate thicker than the adult body is slowly opened, the runway extends forward, and the gate at the end is marked with a distinct The word "zero one". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry is not the undisputed leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first place in the sixth door should be Manfred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenger...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rachel, have you seen it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I could only look up to the nobility in the distance, now it is their turn to chase me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the other party did not show obvious meaning, but...this is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground has launched a wooden frame in front of him with a large card character indicating the outside wind speed, temperature, and the speed of the floating island. In general, the hatch will open in the direction of the headwind for the aircraft to gain greater lift. Of course, considering that the warship door may be attacked by the enemy, it may not be possible to activate the runway that is best suited for takeoff. At this time, parameters such as wind speed are very important, and the driver needs to prepare for increasing the throttle and falling in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode has written a thumbs up gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the last gate finally rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dazzling sunlight instantly pierces the shadow at the end, gradually expanding from a gap, and finally illuminating the entire runway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong wind followed the flood into the warehouse, dispelling the smell of oil licking the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is five, it is a good time to attack -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Signal flag, then force it down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The road is smooth, Goode is out!" Goode shouted as he pressed the joystick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sky Rage roared and started to rush toward the group. During the acceleration process, his afterglow saw the workers in the warehouse on both sides of the runway, facing him. Waved hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment of passing through the light group, there was a short white awn in front of him, but soon everything was in shape, and the vast world was suddenly in his eyes - The noise in the ear no longer exists, as if it was quiet in an instant, and the air with the fragrance of the plants made him feel a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode took off his earmuffs and flew over the floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continually ejected tracer bullets pointed out the direction for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the beast that fled at 60 kilometers per hour, he did not hesitate to chase it up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland before the magic projection, could not help but hold the fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the full picture of the empty mother ship! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge body, the rich military equipment, the carrier-based aircraft that can be placed at any time, just watching it makes people feel mad! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw one and another biplane flying out of the mountain, turning around to chase the fish that escaped from the desert, facing the speed The air knight, which is more than a beast, has become a one-sided situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the desperate mountains blocked the gods of God, they lost dozens of planes before and after to suppress the enemy's fearful herd, and this time In addition to several drone gun towers, more than two hundred beasts did not even cause any damage to humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a headache for our enemies." Itis sneered. It can be seen that she has always been worried about the arrogance of the strategy of destroying human beings by destroying human beings in a self-destructive way. Now I can use the same thing to fight back and make her tone a lot more pleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then they are expected to use more troops to launch a counterattack against us," the iron axe said. "Maybe a new Maharaja level will be sent." High-level devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland silently recalled the information about the Maharajah. According to Wakiris, the best among them is silence. Outside the disaster, there is only the devil who is called the bloody conqueror. Only the latter was promoted by the Lord of Hell, and it is more suitable for the ground battlefield. After all, no fearful beast can withstand its huge body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
