			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, another tank squad rushed to the battle zone between the 12th and 9th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Amy, Poshan, are you okay?" Iphi, headed by a long distance, asked aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poshan waved his hand to show that he was free of obstacles, and Amy shouted excitedly. "How come you? We killed a big guy!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven't heard the sound of gunfire here." After seeing them unharmed, Effie was relieved. She jumped off the tank and hurried to the front of the monster's body that was run by the grenade. She asked with amazement. "What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should be Nest mother, but really, I am not sure." Poshan muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous shot was completely clean and neat, not only smashing its organs, but also slamming his head. Of course, this monster has no head to say - after all, according to common sense, creatures generally do not run backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic also dissipated as it died, and the entire body collapsed instantly, becoming the now fleshy appearance, only standing still, only There are two rows of broken ribs left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure this is a nest mother?" Iphie took out the manual and frowned. "The skeleton is a bit similar, but the body is too small, the tentacles Not enough... Yes, do you see the eyes inside it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant compound eye is one of the most prominent features of the nest, according to the manual It is almost the same size as the nest's organs. It is located in the center of the body and is almost impossible to miss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bossan shook his head. "I guess she is a nest mother, just because it carries a lot of bladed beasts. As for other details, I am as confused as you." ......" She gave a slight meal. "Don't talk about the nest mother. None of the monsters here can be completely matched with the manual illustration. Don't believe you see the dead blade beasts-"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iphie only noticed that the blade beast in front of the nest mother was somewhat different. "This is...wings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Yes,” Poshan replied. “It looks like a flap, but it’s much bigger. With these wings, they can even make long-range flying moves, which can be used in the previous bladed beasts. I haven't seen it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can probably understand why we have to recycle the sample of the Tianhai world." Ifi sighed for a long while, " Their speed of change is too amazing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the problem that needs to be considered above," Poshan climbed up to Tan. , towards Effie, a gesture of departure, "And we - just destroy them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report of the first army to recapture the ruins of Takira was quickly sent to Roland’s office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this "city war," the evil beast is no longer the main opponent. The Tianhai world first appeared in groups, and most of them were extremely threatening blade beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the results are quite different from the previous one or two blade beasts that can make the military defense line ineffective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly formed armored regiment played a decisive role in this battle, not only locking the enemy's position, but also winning most of the results. The First Army finally annihilated the Tianhai world at a very small price and regained its foothold in the fertile plains. Among them, the 12th and 9th car groups cooperated to eliminate a nest mother and more than 10 blade beasts, and their unscathed performance completely changed the military's views. In addition to the statement of the war, the rest were all Applying for the production of more tanks, even if the number of witches is not enough, the general sergeant can also be the captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously they have fully tasted the sweetness of this kind of heavy equipment with integrated attack and defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is not surprised by this result - the title of King of Lands was laid out in two world-scale wars, no matter which aspect of the tank Proven. If this is not the case, he will not take a group of personnel from the army to practice driving skills as early as the beginning of the tractor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
