			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the arrival of the five sleepy island witches in Bianbu Town, Roland has been in a state of excitement. After the dinner, he is now unable to sleep in bed. Climb up and drink a half cup of white wine, forcing the body to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the next day, when Xia Wei in the courtyard began to scream "Oh," he was already awake. I climbed out of bed with great energy and went into the office after a simple wash. At this time, the sky just had a white belly, and the first morning light was evenly sprinkled into the room through the floor-to-ceiling windows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked around for a week and didn’t see the familiar figure. If he usually pushes the door in, he can always lie in the chair and reveal a lazy The look of the nightingale. He couldn't help but smile, sit at the table, take out the notepad from the drawer, and start planning the next witch training program. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helping newcomers to get acquainted with the environment and integrate into the group will naturally have Wendy and the books to do. What he has to do is launch the sugar-coated shells and let the visit Witches enjoy the unique comfort of living here. It is not necessary to leave the other party in Bianbu Town to be successful. Even if you go back, it is an excellent propaganda for your own territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the sun is fully raised, the nightingale finally appears in the office. "Oh? You got up very early today, is it really like Lily said, new to The witch can't hold it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say," Roland smiled and put a bag of dried fish on the table, "Last night and new sister How about getting along?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sister?” She grinned. “You don’t trust them too much.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale reached out and picked up the bag, and turned and sat back on the lounge chair. "The witch named Sylvie, Half of the ten sentences are lies, although it is not serious enough to be unconcerned, but there must be a lot of careful thinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... understandable "Roland is not satisfied. "Probably she wants to see if I am really Roland Wimbledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啥?" A trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If your loved ones change their temperament, you will definitely wonder if he was replaced or controlled?" He laughed, "I Guess Tilly is like this. In Wangdu, I am famous for being idle, not learning, and bullying and fearing evil. How can I stand up and shelter from witches?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, any bad comment to describe the four princes is not excessive, he also turned over in his childhood memories: the four princes accidentally broke a few in the palace In order to avoid the punishment, the crystal glass jar not only pushed the responsibility to Tilly Wimbledon, but also forged the scene and threw the six-year-old sister into the glass slag. With this black history, others are not impressed. It is now normal for a brother who suspects that his temperament has changed, and whoever changes it will want to explore it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also want to know when you say this," the nightingale asked curiously. "Are you really Roland Wimbledon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am neither, nor is it." Roland is a handkerchief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly stopped. "Why can you tell me this sentence is true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Because the truth is." The ability of the nightingale can only distinguish deliberate lies, and he does not think he is lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." She frowned for a long time, finally holding her forehead and decided to give up thinking. "Okay, I will go straight to Anna later." Anyway, as long as you are the Roland I am familiar with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I have always been me since I met you." Roland smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast, the five witches on the island were taken to the office by Wendy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, Your Highness." Five people bowed their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Easy, I am not a very ceremonial person. How do you call Tilly, you can call me in the same way." Roland waved his hand, " I will not arrange any of your work in the first week, mainly familiar with the environment and life of the town. You can visit Bianbu Town at will, no one will be swearing because you are a witch, or trying to catch you for money--I have Excavating the church forces from the West, so here is the same as the Sleeping Island. It is a land of freedom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
