			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not have to be polite," the woman’s voice appeared directly in his mind. "What is the situation above?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He also does not need to speak, just meditation on the answer you want - this kind of conversation is difficult to adapt at first, but after communication, the communication will become very smooth, and of course, it is more difficult to lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God made the adults, some accidents, they did not accept the invitation of the ash ambassador," Barry rewrote the story completely, "This It’s my mistake, I didn’t expect their alertness to be so strong.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The calculation of the people’s plan itself is easy to cause failure,” the voice of God’s voice There is no dissatisfaction, but it is mixed with an inexplicable nostalgia. "Do you have any remedies?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let them have to accept the invitation "He has paused, "using the new policy of Anpein Moya."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啧...凡人."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barrych can't help but, "Adult?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like this policy of clearing witches, you can guarantee not Will anyone be injured as a result?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Don’t say it’s hurt, even if someone in the witch is killed Often, after all, the purpose of the plan is to let the witch set off to the west of the gray fort, and there are no requirements for living a few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what you think?" The voice of God suddenly increased a bit, and the creeping tentacles and the lava that swelled underground showed its anger. "Don't forget what I said, in the face of the end, every witch is very important!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, adults, every word of yours, I Keep in mind," Barrych is not good. He is using consciousness to talk with God. Any thoughts will be conveyed to the other person's heart. "I naturally hope that I will not hurt any innocent people, but it will take more time and manpower. It also needs to be rearranged - not everyone has the courage to fight against the royal family, but also keep the secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let my bodyguards help you," God Soon when I replied quickly, "How long does it take to achieve?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barryhe breathed a sigh of relief. He has seen the ability of these guards. The average knight is not an opponent at all. Almost, even their movements are not clear. If two or three people fight side by side, they can easily resist ten times their own knights, which is enough to show the extraordinary power of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The third step of the plan should be completed within two weeks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Let's do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God makes adults..." Barry hesitated. "Was the witch really so important? Is the god only favoring them? On wealth or power, I am more appropriate -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A more suitable candidate?" God interrupted him. "You I don’t know what I’m talking about, whether it’s wealth or power, it’s meaningless to the end of the world. The gods are looking for a savior who can use its enormous power, not a spokesperson of the world. You are really useful, mortal, So when the mission is completed, I will give you the appropriate rewards - for example, immortality, but you must also recognize your position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barry knows each other What is the end of the mouth? Every four hundred years, the moon will appear in the sky, and the gates of hell will open. The devil will Surging out a massacre will soon be sweeping across the continent, these people can withstand the brutal alien is called the Chosen. Now he has a better understanding of the chosen people - God makes the person he is looking for seems to be directly connected to the power of the gods, and must be a witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." He still has some reluctance. "Will there be a winner in the witches of the Grey Fortress?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God made a rare silence, and after a while, the voice reappeared. "No one knows the answer, it’s just an attempt, and this kind of attempt has lasted for hundreds. Year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If not found?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
