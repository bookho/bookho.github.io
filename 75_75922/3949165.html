			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to develop well, you must take root here. If the land is not good, the wasteland can be reclaimed. If the territory is too small, it can expand outwards, but people are empty talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a piece of territory may be abandoned at any time, then who is willing to buy a home here, who is willing to produce with peace of mind? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Assistant Secretary retired, Roland called Carter Lannis, his chief knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With your people, go find me some local guards, hunters or farmers who have been here for more than five years and have experienced The moon of the demon. If someone has fought the best with the evil beast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers took the lead and Roland licked his forehead and continued to look at the aggregated information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main output of Bianbu Town is mineral and animal fur. The bulk import item is grain. All transportation is through Zhishui River to Changge Fortress or Liuye Town. There are various types of ore in the minerals, iron, copper, sulfur, crystal, ruby, sapphire... This has completely surpassed the concept of associated minerals. He also remembered that Anna once said that the North Slope mining area was reportedly used to be the nest of unknown monsters in the underground. Until now, it has not fully proved the number of ramps at the bottom of the mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning to food, Roland frowned. Most of these ores were sold to the Long Song Fortress, but the other party did not pay with Wang Guojin. It is to use food to offset the price. It is reasonable to say that gems and the like can also be regarded as luxury goods. In a few years of trading, there is neither much grain left in the town and the fiscal revenue. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the output of the mining industry in Bianbu Town was only exchanged for 2,000 rations per year. Considering that before the prince airborne, the lord of this place was a person who was a singer of the long song, and it was understandable that it was produced and sold. Anyway, they seem to have saved more food in this place than the monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fur trade belongs to the local people’s own input, they go west into the lost forest, hunt some birds and beasts, or sell to the long song fortress buyers, Or sell to residents of Liuye Town. Bianyi Town did not set a tax on this transaction because there was no supervision at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought for a moment, since he came, the ore output could no longer be used to offset the price. The branch of the Chishui River runs through the entire kingdom, and traffic is not occluded. With this transport artery, even if the long song fortress no longer provides food, he can also buy it from other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premise is that he can be here, in the town of Bentham, to block the damn monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter’s movements were quick, and two guards and a local hunter were found the next day. “The two are the patrol captains of Bentham Town, each year. The bonfires are all responsible for their release. The hunter said that he and the evil scorpion had handed over, and also personally cut off the head of a wicked beast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People are swearing together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded and let them go back to the side, one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respect... Dear Prince's Hall... Your Highness," the first guard who was called up was so nervous that he couldn't tell, "I and Brian." All... are the people here, oh... when it’s snowing, we...we will go to the North Slope mining area...the beacon tower. There can be...the first time to see the movement of the monsters, if they Overcoming the fans... fascinating the forest, we will point...lighting the bonfire, withdrawing from the small...the road, leaving the fast boat prepared before leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Since it is together, ask your partner to answer it," Roland shook his head and shook his head. "What do the evil beasts look like, can they be killed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Although the other guards are also very nervous, but at least they are not stuttered. "His Royal Highness, it should be possible. They were originally ordinary animals in the forest. Although they were infected by hell, they became arrogant and violent, but they can still Killed. Every year after the demon moon, the long song fortress will send a cavalry team to clean the fortress. The remaining evil beasts on the land of the town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long will the demon moon last?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It usually takes two to three months...it depends on the sun," Brian said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
