			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day of Zhongqiu, Roland received a secret letter from Wangdu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter passed by the flight messenger, ten ** was written by the pro-Tasa to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expanding the paper wrapped around the bird's claws, Roland walked to the window and looked through the bright sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Your Highness, your plan has achieved amazing success."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the Royal Palace It was quickly blocked and no one was allowed to enter or exit, so I couldn’t find out how effective the explosion was. But by the evening, almost all residents knew about the attack on the palace, whether it was in a pub, a hotel, or in a square. There is only one topic for discussion in any place where people gather. Even when the first king died, there was no such sensational influence. Plus the warnings you gave before, many people even think that Tefko is already here. In the attack, you will soon be king and become the new ruler of the Grey Fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This content makes Roland completely relieved - bombing The mission was successfully completed and the witch returned safely. There is no better news than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give yourself a cup of tea, he went back to the red wooden table and continued to look down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, according to the information collected so far, there are no movements in the aristocratic territories outside Wangdu, and the reaction of the palace is also very rapid, so I speculate that Feco Wimbledon is likely to be alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, some people have vowed that the attack came from heaven, and some residents have seen pale white The object descends from the sky and falls into the palace at a very fast speed. So you have a preliminary plan for the task that I have given to me - if I can render this as a punishment for the atrocities of the pseudo-king, I think a lot People will believe it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people I recruited are full of enthusiasm. On weekdays, they collected a lot of violent acts about Tefko, now mixed Together, I think it will be more effective. I believe that in a month or so, the news will pass through the black street mouse to the ears of every city citizen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "In addition, I will continue to closely monitor the movements of the eastern suburbs, but In the former situation, Tefko should have no time to take care of other measures before he came up with a response to the attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no signature at the end of the letter. After reading Roland, he folded the secret letter into the drawer and took a long breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be great if Dongfeng No. 1 could really stop Tief from sending troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, it’s too wasteful to spend a large amount of people on drug-drug operations. The more the other party starts the consumption war, the more they can win more people. Opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland picked up the cup and sipped a fragrant black tea. The next thing to do is to wait for the witches to return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven’t seen Anna for a few days, and no one has stolen the fish in the drawer. He feels a little uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Carter pushed the door of the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, the two ships came to the pier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is the Margaret Chamber of Commerce Arrived? When I spent time on the road, she missed a good show... wait," Roland said, "Is there a fleet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Carter said with a smile. "The messenger group that you sent to the South to recruit people has returned a group of people. The people they brought are almost crowded with docks, and the City Hall is following your plan. Execute that with Miss Lucia..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quarantine work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is to eliminate the possible evil epidemics..." The chief knight coughed twice. "There are about four or five hundred people in this batch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes Roland couldn't help but curl up his mouth. I was still chanting this matter. Now it has achieved results. It seems that the temporary resettlement house that Lien is responsible for has to be added a batch. "Let's go check it out."<br / ><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camo Spoel put down a thin scrap and kept repeating a sentence, "It turns out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher?" Chames is worried. Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since getting this "Medium Chemistry", Kaimo has not slept for two days, almost reading the entire ancient book all night. He also took a few glances, but the above is too esoteric and difficult to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very good," the chief alchemist's voice is completely untiring, but the spirit is full of vibrancy, although there are eye stains in the corner of the eye, but the eyes are stunned. It is not like a person who has not slept all night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy to be disturbed when the instructor delects the alchemy. This is a rule that a disciple should follow. Until then, Chammes dared to ask, "This The book... The disciple can't understand, what is the atom, what is the electron?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are already a qualified alchemist, don't be a disciple again. Self-proclaimed, according to His Highness, we are now colleagues," Cameron paused. "As for your question, I don't know how to answer it... In fact, when His Royal Highness gave me "Medium Chemistry" to me, This book is also attached."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chames looks at another book on the table with the cover of "Theory of Natural Science" The words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Schuer...sir," he is not very accustomed to this title. "It looks like alchemy...no, there is no connection between chemistry." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I originally thought so," Kemo said with a beard. "But after flipping a few pages, I realized that I actually have nothing to do with the world." Known."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Chames was stunned. Nothing to know? The alchemist studies the composition of the objects, the nature of the elements, and if they are all ignorant, what is the difference between other people and monkeys? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean the concept," the chief alchemist's voice is full of excitement... and satisfaction, "We think that alchemy is alchemy, it is the study of matter, The sun rises and falls, the flowers bloom and fade, and they have nothing to do with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Isn't that the case...watching the sun and the stars are good for astrologers As for the plants, Chamez slightly dismissed, "Only the farmer and the drug collector will study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So we know nothing about it "Kemo shook his head. "From the very beginning, this book tries to connect everything, whether it is stone, flowers, thunder, or flame. It consists of a unified object and runs under uniform rules. Not only chemically complete. According to the regular reaction, even the sun rises and falls, and flowers fall and fall. This rule is so precise that as long as the starting conditions are the same, the results will be exactly the same, and chemistry is only a small part of it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...this, how Can?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also find it hard to imagine," he spread out the periodic table of elements, "in medium chemistry, it sets the shape of the element - one A large number of small balls surrounded by a large ball. The big ball determines what kind of element it is. The number and number of outer spheres determine the characteristics of the element. This list is arranged according to this rule. It is as neat as a soldier in a line. I also fully understand the meaning of His Highness: why I have never seen or contacted this element, and can infer its nature and reaction mechanism. Because even the root of the reaction, It is also the gain and loss of the small ball, which does not involve the change of the big ball at all. This is also the reason why the elements in the reaction will not disappear and will only be transferred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chammes pondered for a moment, "Do you...believe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These theories are too embarrassing and cannot be verified by the eyes, then the person who wrote the book again How did you know? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, so I can't answer the questions you asked before," Kemer smiled. "But believe it doesn't matter, the key is it. The perspective provided from what I never imagined... It made me see another door, and the door was engraved with more than just chemistry.” He said a little bit of his voice here, “unfortunately, His Royal Highness failed to take it. All recorded. He may not be able to understand what he missed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chames does not understand this, as if he was an apprentice In the face of the alchemist's terminology is like another language, now he has this feeling again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
