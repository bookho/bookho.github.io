			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depth of the labyrinth of the cave, the tremor of the head is getting louder and louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa knows that they are approaching here, a large number, large and powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She puts her limbs into the soil, spreads to the upper layer, and then "sees" everything that happens outside the mountain - the black-pressed evil beasts rushing over the mountains In the meantime, several entrances to the labyrinth ruins were blocked by the mighty Hell fear beast, so that the mixed species behind him frantically bit the body and viscera of the fearful beast until a new passage was opened from it. If you don't do this, they will be squeezed into the hole by other evil beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only a long time before this channel will be blocked again, and the method of dredging is to repeat the process of the previous step. The result is that the evil beast has not yet entered. In the core area of ​​the ruins, the scene at the entrance is like a flesh and blood purgatory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no peace between the strata, the wilderness beast is passing through it, the mouthparts that are full of teeth are the most effective digging tools, the greasy and moist skin makes them It is effortless when the ground is creeping. The long body carries a lot of symbiotic mixed species. Once this monster breaks through the line of defense, it often gives the defender a huge casualty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the sky there are also variant flying species, but they can’t enter the ruins and can only scream in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an indescribable experience, obviously not directly witnessing it all, but whether it is the humming over the mountains, every tremor on the surface, or friction in the soil The sounds are accurately transmitted into her mind through thousands of tentacles, and have formed countless vivid pictures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the largest evil beast attack since the winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partha retracted his limbs and sank to the deeper ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, finely divided soil fell from the top of the cave, and the brazier on both sides of the passage creaked - she could see every single underground without the need of fire. Granules, but those companions who are transformed into gods are needed, but at this moment everyone has moved to the labyrinth hall, and she has extinguished the open flame in the basin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the situation above?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just entering the hall, Aer’s voice Ringing in the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The wilderness beast that is closest to us has broken through to the third floor," Pasha will answer to the consciousness of all people. "The situation under the labyrinth?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No abnormalities were found," Els said back. "I saw a few blackened bodies."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the replacement of the new body, Pasha's perception of combat has changed dramatically. The original flat world suddenly became stereoscopic. Since the enemy can move freely underground, survivors must always pay attention to the situation at their feet. As long as they do not stand at the end of the abyss, they should not ignore the hidden threats. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below the ruins is a flowing river of magma, which closes most of the bottom of the labyrinth and saves them a lot of trouble. From the current point of view, there are no evil beasts that are not afraid of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long will it take for the instrument to be ready?" Pasha looked to Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, half an hour, or an hour?" The voice of the latter came from the core of the magic. "I have tried my best, but four." The damage to the thirteen districts has just been fixed, and Eleanor needs time to calculate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, they can't come so fast," she said. "The large mixed species will be stuck outside the hole, and the small beast will be handed over to us to deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyday practice is good," said Elena. "With us, the evil beast can't attack the hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I don't think it should be so fast. Going back to the Ming relics, is it better to let the Star City consume for a while?" Someone said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
