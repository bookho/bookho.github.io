			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell Passy was silent for a while before saying, "Are you a threat or an invitation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the invitation," said the nightingale, "His Highness does not agree to use force to drive any witch. In fact, I hate that set."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I refused," Speer said without hesitation. "If he really needs my help, he can come to the Dragon Ridge with a witch and visit the aristocratic ceremonies." Instead of sending someone to sneak into my castle. Of course, if the church is brought to the attention, I can't guarantee the safety of the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer is not unexpected According to the nightingale, in fact, I want a stranger who has no relationship to promise a rather difficult request. Generally speaking, there are only two methods of intimidation and lure. The former does not want to use, and the latter does not use it. The Marquis of Passy is already one. The Lord of the City, and then up is the guardian of the realm, and His Royal Highness is not only not ready to seal the land, but also intends to take back all points. The power of the aristocracy is called centralization according to his statement. Therefore, in disguise, if she works for Her Royal Highness, she has reduced her position in the eyes of the traditional aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for following the creation of a new world by His Royal Highness Roland, and against the terrible enemies in the battle of God, these told her that she would not believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand," the night grin, "So let me say goodbye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Wait..." Speer looked very surprised. "Just... like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am responsible for bringing the message of His Royal Highness, now You know, and give a reply, the task is naturally completed," she grinned. "Otherwise, would you like me to tie you back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" How do you know that my ability is a magical channel?” The Marquis hesitated, “...have you been with the group of witches who are going to the fjord islands?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You guessed it right, the leader of the group of witches, Tilly Wimbledon, is now staying in Bianbu Town, and with her brother to fight against the demon moon," the night sherbling shrugged, "His Royal Highness is also from her." I got your message."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They didn't go to the fjord?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Before they went to the fjord I don’t know that His Royal Highness Roland has already established a foothold in the West. He didn’t get in touch until he settled on the island.” She outlined the process of the alliance on both sides. “This time, Tily’s travel to the West was also invited by him. Come, just like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Four Princes, he really...has a system of witches and ordinary people coexisting in the territory?" Speer Frowning asked, obviously I don't believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not only that, but also pushed the church out of his territory," the nightingale smiled. "Now there are more than a dozen witches living in Bianbu Town. Their existence is accustomed to it. I never lie about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The Marquis stood up and poured a cup of tea for her. I have some, how did he do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to know," the nightingale turned and walked back to the table. under. These deeds may not change the other's decision, but it is not a bad thing to deepen mutual understanding. She decided to focus on the formation of the Witch Alliance, the war with the Duke of Ryan, and the governance after the recovery of the long song fortress, so that the other party Can also generally understand the situation of the witch in the town. When the lower house unified the Grey Fort, the witch Marquis should not do too much fearless resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there was a sudden bang in the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Speer looked at the nightingale in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter pushed the window open, and it was really smashed outside. "Dangerous! Lightning found an unexpected situation!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A team of judges is coming to the castle!" The pigeons flap their wings Tao, "At least 20 people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
