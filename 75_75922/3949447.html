			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western, Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The washing stone purchased from Silver City was full of four boats, and it took several days to unload it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that there is sufficient raw material, the soap production plan should be officially put on the agenda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matching workshops and warehouses have already been set up - the soap factory is located next to the industrial park, next to the No. 2 steam assembly plant, the shape is exactly the same . The roof, beams and wall panels are made of wood, the size is smaller, and the wood cutting and lifting work is carried out by the witches, so the construction period takes only one week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using wash stone, also known as trona, to make soap is essentially a series of chemical reactions. The required raw materials are also very common, in addition to soda ash, a large amount of lime milk and grease are required. The lime milk is a suspension which is precipitated at the bottom of the container after immersing the lime in water, and is used for reacting with soda ash to form caustic soda, and then reacting with caustic soda to form higher fatty acid salt and glycerin. The former is even soap, while the latter is an extremely important raw material for explosives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the soap was made before, Roland had already tested the full reaction process in the backyard of the castle. The principle is basically the same, but to expand a small number of trial production into mass production, it is still necessary to develop reasonable processes and specifications, and more importantly, professional chemical personnel are needed to guide production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, he called the chief alchemist into the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, you have requested a large-scale process for the production of sulfuric acid, I have already thought of a possible solution." Upon entering the door, Camo Spoel is loud "Oh, this requires a lot of lead, and the blacksmith who made the lead into a container. I heard that some of your witches can cut the metal accurately. The sizzling shovel is made by her. Can I ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, report the shape and size of the container you requested, I will let the Witch Alliance do it," Roland waved to him. Next, "I am looking for you today not for acid, but for another task."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, I really can’t spare time to do anything else. "Kem has repeatedly shook his head. "The large-scale acid production is a formidable challenge. I must go all out." He paused and added, "The disciples are not good. They are helping me prepare this. Nothing can be left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, you can't use too much time, Roland drank a cup of tea. "You don't need to adjust your proud disciples to take charge. Just a few apprentices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The...the task is What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Manufacture of soap is a cheap version of the soap in the convenience market. It has the same function as soap and can be used for bathing and washing clothes. And clean tableware."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the saponification reaction mentioned in "Primary Chemistry"?" Kaymo touched the beard, "using sodium hydroxide and The one that reacts with oil to form alcohol and salt?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a very peculiar feeling to hear standard chemical nouns from an alchemist’s mouth, especially the word Still made by myself. Roland resisted the smile, and the first place was right. "Yes, it is the saponification reaction recorded in the ancient book. I also used it to find out how to make soap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "So what do you need me to do? If it is not very important, I suggest that you go to production later. After all, your people will have no problem even if they don’t take a bath for a few days, clothes and plates, directly in the river. "The bubble is just fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is very important," the prince stressed. "Or, it’s not important to make soap, but the by-product in the production process is What I am in urgent need of now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean...ol?" Kemer didn't take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s alcohol, you can call it glycerin," Roland said. "It's a very important ingredient, and it's no less than two." Acid.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well,” Camo Spoel shrugged. “But it’s good, I don’t have time to implement it myself.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
