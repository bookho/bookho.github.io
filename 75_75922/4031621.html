The iron axe replied immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it’s very skilled, just do it." Because there is no military court yet, the major faults in the military are personally interrogated by Roland. Danny’s disciplinary behavior apparently did not come to this. “But considering that it is the moment of war, first shut him for five days, and the rest will go back to the winter city and execute it again.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to worry about the reaction of the soldiers, which is a good example of propaganda - regardless of the person What merits have been made, as long as there is a violation of discipline in the course of the mission, it will be punished." Rolandton paused. "Of course, the military achievements he made, the army will not forget, if anyone asks, You said that I have my own arrangements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this thing also has his pot, although he built a team of 50 accurate shooters, but he These veteran talents with shooting talents are not separated from ordinary firearms battalions, and they are only used as a range longer. Rifle rounds scheduled in the trenches wings for blocking attempts to Moxiang machine gun bunker from the edge of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Danny’s approach is more like a sniper – free choice of position, free fire, waiting to eliminate the most valuable target of the enemy. Roland did not consider a special sniper squad, but the latter has high requirements for firearms, ammunition and personnel. In particular, the personnel, first of all, do not talk about subjective initiative, first of all he has to ensure that the sniper will not lose contact directly after the release, or passively avoid the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps after the end of the war, he can make some improvements based on the accurate shooter team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty, I have tortured some of the ... special information from the commander of the captured church," the Iron Axe seems to be thinking about, " "Related to God's fines."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They said, God punishment There is no way for the army to act alone. These warriors must be ordered by the controller to complete the most basic tasks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland turned and said, "Oh? There are other This is also mentioned by the ashes. For this reason, he dared to lead the whole army to force the church to open the regiment. Otherwise, the other party sent a small scorpion to the squad, and the four were in the kingdom. It is enough for him to suffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The controller can be an ordinary person or a pure person, but once set, it cannot be changed." Iron Axe recalls, "Newly promoted The Prisoners will complete the follow-up ceremony on the top floor of the Hermes Cathedral, and one of the captives admitted that they personally participated in the secret meeting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland immediately ordered Dao, "Take me to meet them, and call Ai Gesha together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Deep in the dungeon, Roland saw the four captives being held separately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the surface of the valley town is still cool and pleasant, the underground is called wet and cold. All four were blindfolded, and their hands were tied behind their backs. The body was wet, and although they could not see any scars, they could not stop shaking. Obviously, the Iron Axe used his unique torture technique. According to him, few people can spend a day under torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the believers in the church are different from the average subject, and the respect for the gods makes them more tenacious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only the two on the right are willing to explain," Shamin whispered. "One of them is the presiding judge of the church, and the other is the priest of the Holy City. The two are not willing to disclose - of course, they do not know that their companions have already recruited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland does not understand the church system and position, straightforward Asked, "Who participated in the follow-up ceremony of the Prisoners? Brought to the interrogation room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer was quickly dragged into a small house next door by the jailer. The iron axe poured a cold water on his head. "Farat, now I have a few questions to ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk to me about the Prisoners, how is the follow-up ceremony held?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falat shook his head and did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen, this is the last interrogation," the iron axe bent down and whispered in his ear. "After answering all the questions, then I give You are free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a while, he only once again confessed, "The ceremony... is usually held in the Tongtian Tower, where only the gods can be allowed to punish the warrior, The pope and the controller enter, the scene... must be quiet and silent to ensure that the ceremony is not wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Roland said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the new warrior will confirm the controller based on the sound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They heard The first sound?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be more than one..." Farath gasped. "The selected controllers chanted hymns for a certain period of time." Anyone can be accepted by the disciples."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about you? Also a controller?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I am responsible for...a small team, ten gods and warriors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the ten people have to obey the orders of their superiors, right?" < br br br br br br br So, Roland thought that he thought it would be a brain-wave connection or a spiritual connection to command this unconscious army. The result was sound control. This method of layer-by-layer superposition is undoubtedly extremely complicated and inefficient. It is not easy to say that the sound waves are easily attenuated. It is the conflict between the command of the squad and the commander of the commander, which will make it difficult for the gods to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said that once you determine the controller, you can't change it. If the god-martial warrior loses all the controllers?" Ai Gesha suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing is a woman’s voice, and Farat is obviously a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Return!" The iron axe took another scoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...do not know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You lie," Roland soon got The nightingale reminder, "If you don't want to stay in the dungeon for ten days and a half, it's best not to play this trick."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant bit his teeth," They... will go to the wilderness on their own, I only know so much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The wild land?" Ai Gesha was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also heard about it... Generally, there will be other warriors to stop, but..." He hesitated for a moment, "The rumor is very Some of the gods who had not been properly controlled had fled to the wilderness, and never returned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know that the Prisoner is How to convert?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...only the Pope is qualified to preside over the promotion ceremony..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the pope abdicated, how do you transfer the control of the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Farat sweated on his forehead. Beads, "I don't know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How was the church founded four hundred years ago?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you heard of the name Akalis? The Federation, Tachela?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After no matter what loves Gesha Asked, the priest can't answer a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He really doesn't know, let's go." Roland said after confirming the nightingale, "There is no result if you ask again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
