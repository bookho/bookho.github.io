			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy city of Hermes, the cathedral tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps of the guards broke the silence of the ring office, the sound of the iron boots falling on the marble floor was crisp and loud, and Teflon was slightly dissatisfied with the hand. The breakfast, looking to the look of the panicked, "What's the matter?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bishop, the cold wind ridge has gone wrong," the guardian ear whispered, "The Sorley Dahl seems to have been hit hard there. Then he told the things he had heard the fastest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about! "Tefron was too surprised to believe in his own ears." The advance army was ruined more than half, and Soli was seriously injured? The old bishop grabbed the guard. "Where is he now?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" has been sent to the almshouse. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about those gods?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The instructions that were placed in the field were now gathered in the church hall. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Immediately notify Pope Her Majesty and Lord El, report the matter to them, and take care of the levy, close the church door, temporarily It is forbidden for other believers to come and go! "He didn't even eat breakfast," I am going to the almshouse right now. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, sir! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefron only feels heart pounding, thousand The team of three hundred people, and three hundred people are godly warriors. It is reasonable to say that there will be no problem in dealing with the cold winds. Before the rise of the bishop, Soli was also the judge of the battle, and Mae was the most effective. One of the subordinates, even if they encounter the devil or the wild beast, they will not lose so many people!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the storm is raging in the heart, the old bishop is still very Clearly, the most important thing at the moment is to block the news, to avoid the faltering of faith, and secondly to understand as soon as possible what Soly Dahl has encountered in the cold wind!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When he rushed to the almshouse, El had arrived - apparently the other side had access to the news, the two looked at each other and fell into the medical room of Soli.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a pure person who was giving medicine to the injured archbishop - one of his arms was missing and the wound was covered with cotton Strictly, seeing the other two archbishops, Soli’s confused eyes suddenly had the focus and struggled to sit up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You go ahead,” Thai After Fron let the pure man leave, he helped him up. "How is the injury?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to see Mae! "Soli whispered, "Come and take me to the sect!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First tell us what happened," El cold said. "Then we will consider whether you sent to see the pope or throw you into it." In the dungeon, wait for the trial of the arbitral tribunal. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Budget, now is not a time to bicker," he said with a grin. "The cold wind is a trap. Roland Wimbledon has a firearm. Feike is much more terrible, I have to let my Majesty know--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to be left in the drums to wipe your butt, Soli Mr. Dahl! "Er's voice also suddenly rose a little higher. "Do you know how embarrassing you are to come back?" When passing through the city gate, everyone saw the incomplete and unsettled advance army! Someone in the holy city has already started to inquire about the news. If it weren’t for the arbitral tribunal that I had arrested a few good deeds, this damn rumor would have made the whole city boiled tomorrow! "She grabbed the archbishop's collar. "You should understand how serious this is!" "Thuron knows that El is right, more than a hundred gods are punished, almost equivalent to the total loss of the church in the past two years, and the enemy is only A small town in a mountain is definitely a shame for the church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More fatally, once the news spreads, the faith of the believers will be hit hard. Since the dispatch of the Prisoners to fight against the evil beasts, this invincible warrior has had invincible rumors. The same seems to be the case, even the horrible and ferocious The giant evil beast is not the opponent of the gods, and what kind of enemy can defeat them?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
