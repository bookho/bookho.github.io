			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you talking about?" Even the Count of Quinn who saw the wind and waves was shocked by this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where he was surprised was not "the new Lord of the Morning," but "entered by Roland Wimbledon." A word can be said by many people, but even if you don't change the word, these words are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Horne’s meaning was similar, he clearly understood that the power of the family alone could not break away from the control of the royal family of Moya. It is an unrealistic fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the speaker becomes the king of the Grey Fort, there is power between the words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the same as you think," probably because of the mother’s death, Andreia’s tone is no longer the original sharp, “Roland’s I don’t want Anpein Moya to continue to sit on the throne and not want to see a disputed neighbour. In order to stabilize the situation as soon as possible, it is necessary to support an undisputed new king.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning that he had not heard the mistake, the count muttered, "Why me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is There weren't many acquaintances in the morning, so I chose the first one, but I refused."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it because of this reason? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the daughter refused, she threw the throne to her daughter’s father. It’s just like a child’s play... but unexpectedly, Horford felt that the other person was not Laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Ampe is forbidden to talk about the failure of the Battle of Hermes, there are too many nobles to participate in, so that it is impossible to completely ban. Hofferd knew very well that the enemy that Anpei encountered was not the church, but the gray castle that was also looting the holy city. The army of 10,000 people was almost defeated by a face-to-face, and even many participants could not tell how they lost. Only the skyfire thunder and the constant fall of the head, whether it is unprotected serfs or knights full of armor, are turned into ashes in this flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the source is not wrong, it means that the power of the Grey Fort has exceeded the imagination of the nobility. Under such a comparison of strengths, it seems that it is not unreasonable to decide who is going to be a king in a neighboring country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only question is, why is he not coming by himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the morning aristocrats are willing to bring all their strengths together and have a positive confrontation with him, he will definitely consider this option." Lia seems to have known that the Earl would raise such a question. "In short, Roland has a more important enemy to deal with. He has no time to spend three or four years to bring the whole morning into the Grey Fort Kingdom. After all, destroy the nobility. The power of domination is simple, but it is a long process to recast the order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More important...the enemy?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, devil." Andrea slowly said, "Otto Passy should have mentioned to you that everything the church has done is for the news of a doomsday battle. And that's just a corner of the secret. The name of this war is called "God" and has been going on for nearly a thousand years. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to her daughter's remarks, Count Howard felt a cold sweat on his back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Originally including the morning sun, such a prosperous four kingdoms, is actually a corner of the land? In humans has failed two times in a row, if you lose once again, it will be ruined, Roland Wen Bouton also dared to take such a burden and compete with the incredible enemies for the affiliation of God's will?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much will and courage does this need?<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just thinks about it and feels that he is too fast to breathe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? "The count is a little shouted. "What good is this for him? Is he not afraid of failure? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know..." Andrea sighed. "His Highness has mentioned this, but her statement is even more It is puzzling. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
