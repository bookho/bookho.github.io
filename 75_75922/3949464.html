			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei did not expect that when he set foot on his way to Bianbu Town, he would be full of expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest on the Chishui River has begun to yellow, and the breeze blowing in the face brings a touch of coolness. The shimmering river tumbling under the feet, from time to time can see the falling leaves slipping through the side of the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the last anxiety and uneasiness, the surrounding autumn scenery has also become poetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Mey," came a reverent voice behind her. "What is the "Witch Diary" you performed, is it the script written by your Royal Highness himself? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei turned and saw a group of actresses coming around, and the one who took the lead looked at herself nervously, she remembered that the other person seemed Called the swallows. "Ah, sorry," Irene waved at her bow and smiled loudly. They came to ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idiot... Mayi turned his eyes and blindly. If it was before, she would only sneer in two sneers. Probably staying with Irene for a long time, my patience is getting better and better. "Not for His Highness, but for the Minister of Education of the City Hall, the book is written for the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, is that the case?" The swallow blinked. "When you argue with Bella, we all think it is true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness wrote" and "His Royal Highness wrote for me", the difference between the two is far from the difference. How do these people listen to the first half of the sentence? "But the script writing and theatrical performances have been recognized by His Royal Highness, so Bella's mocking of the script is indeed a mockery of His Highness. I have nothing to do with her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you seen His Royal Highness Prince?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that he has a royal gray hair with a symbolic look, handsome and extraordinary. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also heard that he is alive and has a lot of lovers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hey, is that true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Looking at the lively little girl, Mayi couldn’t help but frown, damn, she shouldn’t Responding to their curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, don't bother Miss Mey," Luo Xia walked up and blew them away, showing an apologetic look at Mayi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem," she shrugged and continued to admire the scenery along the coast. "After all, this is my own trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand," Luo Xia scratched his head. "Why do you want to bring them when you leave? Of the thirty-five people, only two have boarded the stage, and twenty-six have not even Complete all the courses in the drama class. According to your previous statement, they are not even nestling birds, and they are still not hatched in the eggshell... Even if the lord adults do not have high requirements for drama, these people may not be accepted by His Royal Highness. If you want to retaliate against Bella, you should also draw on those experienced supporting actors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't intend to let them all play."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" The other party was in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They can understand the script, right?" Mey smiled. "Despite the long distance from the stage performance, they can at least Read and write. Do you not find it? Your Highness now needs such a talent." She paused for a moment. "Do you think that Roland Wimbledon really invited us to perform because of the love of drama?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it’s an adult, then the answer must be affirmative. Before he took over the long song fortress, he had the habit of patronizing the theater once a week. But the words of His Royal Highness, except for the first show of the new drama, will not appear in the town square for the rest of the time - so he promoted the drama not because His own preferences, but intend to use the drama to publicize his views to the masses." Mey went on to say, "Compared with the initial emphasis on oppression and witch is not evil, the new screens "Dawn" and "New City" have recruited people. With the goal of hard work and getting rich, I just follow him. Do something to be meager."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking about a script, in addition to substituting yourself into the role of thinking, but also to understand the meaning of the whole story as much as possible, this is also the quality that must be possessed as a good actor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, thank you for your guidance!" she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure," Mayi curled his mouth. "If you don't want to act, you can find a good job in Bianbu Town, maybe you can enter." The City Hall became an administrative official. After all, His Royal Highness does not require identity or family history. This road is much better than being an actor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ship arrived in the town, Mey saw Film Hiller greeted at the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he came for Irene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed as she saw the girl rushing into his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that person not dawning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out that he was not sentenced to exile by His Royal Highness... ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first Cavaliers in the West, yeah, it’s good." The swallow admired, "I thought he would be the star of the theater-"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What nonsense," Mey’s cold drink made everyone close their mouths. "Hurry and bring your luggage off the boat. Gat and Rocha will take you to the town hall to register." Identity, the rest, listen to them and arrange it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Everyone replied reverently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked down the dock, the film came over with his wife and greeted her. "Miss Mey, Irene just told me about the conflict in the theater." Thank you for your care of her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No thanks," Mey didn't take it for granted. "The other person seems to be looking for her trouble, actually "I am coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Even so, I still want to thank you." The Cavaliers smiled heartily. "If it weren't for you, she would cry on the spot." Come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the two left, Mey pouted, carrying his luggage alone and heading for the residential community. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this feeling has been put down, but when she saw this scene, she still felt a little emotional, and the familiar figure did not appear, but still in the letter I vowed to give myself a surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the other party is an important person around the Highness, and can’t be as casual as Xiaochen Chenguang? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got home, Mey put down the parcel and a long-lost feeling of relaxation came. She took a long breath and took out the liquor from the cupboard. When she was about to have a drink, there was a knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the door, standing outside is Carter Lannis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to be half an hour early," he wiped the sweat from his forehead. "I heard the ship from the Long Song Fortress has arrived, I I came over from the military camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, obviously I didn’t see him at the dock, obviously didn’t receive it, but saw his appearance, Mei’s mood. Instantly happy, "Would you like to have a drink?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I have a task in the afternoon," Carter waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," she nodded. "His Royal Highness is more important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I came to send you a present," the chief knight handed out a white wooden box from her pocket and handed it to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the latest product in the convenience market?" Mayi curiously took the wooden box, opened the lid, and saw a yellow orange ring ring quietly Standing on the bottom of the box, its top is inlaid with a sinuous transparent gemstone, reflecting the colorful light under the autumn sun through the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
