			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days later, "Wolf Heart" officially started shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland had already expected this to be a very novel experience, but did not expect it to be interesting to this extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first day of the project’s launch attracted the attention of all members of the Witch Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they haven’t really seen the movie, they don’t hinder them from imagining the excitement of the show based on the participants’ live rehearsals, not to mention that some of the actors are still ancient witches. With the description of the personal experience, the attraction of the shadow is raised to the peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do a survey of "where you want to go" in the witch community, the answer must be the dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can’t go to dreams, but now they have the chance to see the drama in that world. This temptation is no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, from early to late, the phenomenon of eating and drinking and playing cards suddenly disappeared. Instead, it was the strong call of everyone to join the filming, even Tilly with no exceptions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is not mistaken, this is the first time she has made a request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the crew had to temporarily change a few actors - as long as it did not affect daily production, Roland was happy to join them, and more witches participated. It also makes the trend of the drama more and more strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the photographer was replaced by lightning from the beginning of Amy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to express the intimacy of the sisters and the happy life of the childhood, the little girl slowly descended from the winter city without the cold wind, and the outline of the snowy city At the end of the day, she flew across the street and the pedestrians, flew into the castle window with ice rims, and fell to the burning fireplace - a huge city with narrow bedrooms, snow and flames, and passers-by With the laughter sisters, the three sets of contrasts instantly outline the inner world in which the two are closely connected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Roland spent a lot of time, and finally used even poor painting techniques to let everyone understand the meaning of the "lens". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he noticed that when he used the pen and paper to tell the basic shooting skills, Mei Yi’s eyes flashed inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s undeniable that the Star of the West has a talent in the drama that is not available to ordinary people – she seems to be able to construct a complete picture in her mind. One person and one thing on the stage can be the object of her use. This advantage is not obvious for traditional dramas performed in a fixed area, but after switching to the lens language, her talents are like finding an excellent vent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another recognized genius, the second princess actor Irene is obviously not such a talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The switching of various perspectives becomes normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From simple imitation to inference, the period is only a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even some techniques have a taste of modern movies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the different kings appeared, she used a partial to the whole way of shooting - first the boots filled with jewels, then the golden cloak and the cloak In the end, it was a handsome face with a smile, and then extended to the trailing Huafu attendant team, and the characteristics of its rich and powerful people were vividly reflected. By the way, the prince's actor is her husband, Carter Lannis. Although Roland does not want to admit it, the carefully dressed chief knight is indeed the representative of the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of lenses is just one aspect of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more amazing is the appearance of special effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, every day, fresh ideas pop up, and on this basis, incredible visual effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, from the hand of Soroya, it can be a real "stereo background."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the mist of the nightingale, the magical servant of Molly, the illusion of the shadow...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜 is a one-person decoration, the shape of the pigeon At that time, it was a good friend of my sister. After the incarnation of the beast, it became the devil's lord. It was difficult to solve the problem with the wolf in the snowfield. The scene was fierce, and it could be used to describe the mountain shake and the birds and beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, these special effects are also inseparable from the support of lotus and honey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the filming was halfway through, the number of participants exceeded 300....not only the Witch Alliance, the Sleeping Curse and the Tacula remnants. A big interest is not so much a drama, but rather a more carnival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing on the wall, Roland looked at the crowds that were not far away, and I couldn’t help feeling some emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t expect that breaking the three-way barrier and getting closer to each other would be a filming – if these groups were still faint before The distinction between each other is like oil and water. When they come together, they will slowly separate. So at this moment, he can't see the obvious difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what ability you have, everyone uses it on the same thing. There is no strong and weak icy boundary, and there is no distinction between geography and faction. As long as you use your brain, you will be able to find your own position. This feeling invisibly diminishes the difference between people and makes creation. The results have become the link to connect people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For him, this is really an unexpected joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland took a sigh of relief and turned to look at Anna. "Don't you relax with them?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first nightingale only took pictures when she needed her ability, but then she was completely happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will continue to be busy later," Anna reached out and showed the oil on the lower cuff. "The dimensions of the internal combustion engine parts on the drawings are not completely referenced." , still need to be adjusted. And..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?" Roland blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s best to relax with you," she smiled, leaning her head against his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm flames spread out to dispel the chill in the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also closed his mouth and enjoyed the quiet silence of her busy life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Anna whispered, "The future you promised has been realized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He looks at each other's eyes--with the drama, not only the witches from all over the place, but also the ordinary people in the crew. Mey is gesticulating and seems to be teaching Roga and Carter how to play a rivalry; Irene is on the side, happily combing the hair, while the latter is half-squinting, a look of enjoyment; Together with the gods and sorcerers, they placed the props needed for the next scene. Compared to the factory floor where the division of labor is clear, the relationship here is undoubtedly more natural and harmonious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unrelated to ability, they are all the same kind among the white snow that wraps everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, there are still some that are not implemented." Roland shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean other places in the Grey Fort? Those cities should not be too far away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not talking about the relationship between ordinary people and witches, but another commitment." He smiled back. "I thought I should be fully prepared, and then follow the process to achieve it step by step. But Now I find out that it is not important whether they are important or not. The key is to do it. As for what kind of consequences will happen, there is always a solution. Just like this movie, just because there are no rules, can it bring more Surprise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So this promise is..." Anna raised her head and licked the blue eyes of Lake Biwa, on the undulating lake, he seemed to Can see the reflected snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
