			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe sitting cross-legged on the floor, staring at the seven twisted bars at his feet . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the sign of the number of days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every past day, he will use his fingers to draw a line in the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And today is the seventh day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina is still alive now, Lorenzo is still tormenting her, he has long dared not think about these problems, as long as the thoughts move a little, my heart There will be a tearing tingling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe began to wonder if he would make a wrong choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the guardian Sean agreed to his request, although he was not detained after being detained, the gray castle was too far from the wolf. Wait until the news is passed to the king of the Grey Fort, and then he will make a decision and send a wolf, which will take at least a month or more. If you add discussion, consideration, and priority to things, I am afraid that it will be even later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no confidence that Roland Wimbledon will treat the church’s infighting like a domestic government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not impossible to even refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that case, all his efforts failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe draped his gaze and looked at the chain on his ankle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It connects itself to the foot of the bed, almost one person long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you can use this chain to...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, awake? The curtain of the tent was suddenly opened, and the glare of the light came in, making him unconsciously squinted. "It didn't sleep. So let's take a trip with us."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where... Where?" The sudden light is like interrupting his thoughts, and his mind is as blank as the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is to go to the wolf heart. Why, are you not eager to save your lover?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The line of sight gradually adapted to the sun, and it was Shawn who stood in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a key was lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe realized the meaning of the other party’s words at this time, he shivered and grabbed the key, “Difficult, is it...”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Majesty approved the rescue plan and decided to take you back to the Winter City for trial." Sean said calmly. "The team responsible for the operation has arrived in Coral Bay and joined them. You can go directly to Dagong Island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already...has it arrived? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How come so fast? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can hardly believe his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now is not the time to think about this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy opened the lock in a hurry, and when he stood up, he also took a nap because of his long-term sitting, but he finally stood up straight. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "If you feel unwell, then ......" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "No, please take me past !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He eagerly begged. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Sean slight tilt mouth, "Then come on." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Joe looked back at the The mark on the ground, the twisted bar was printed with a silver edge on the sun, as if it were shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he finally saw a glimmer of hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy took a deep breath and followed the guards out of the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coral Bay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the port on the far east side of the morning sun. It is undoubtedly much more deserted than the seaports that are closer to the gray fort and fjord. This has been especially true since the wolf heart and the eternal winter have been swept away by the church. The royal family and the aristocrats have been fighting for power, and they are still in chaos, and trade has fallen a lot. Most of the sailboats docked on the docks hang on the flag of the Fjord Chamber of Commerce, while ships in the North have few views. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the sparsely seafarers is quite eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has no sails, black smoke on its head, large wooden wheels hanging on both sides, and the hull is like a pile of stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary gray fort stone ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have heard of its existence for a long time, I saw it for the first time at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people boarded the deck and immediately two people greeted them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a man and a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe’s eyes swept over the two quickly, and my heart condensed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown, he faintly felt that the woman seemed familiar, as if she had seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, it turned out to be Ms. Zoe and Ms. Betty," Sean greeted the two with enthusiasm. "Have you handed this action over to you?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because we were in the winter without a winter, we had a morning dawn." The woman shrugged. "If it is not the meaning of your majesty, I really don't want to go so far." The place to come... the front line has been handed over to the devil, I should stay there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to the word lady, I hope you more I can change to the title of Miss," the man grinned. "I am different from Zoe. It is the latest one to wake up. It is only a hundred years now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "A hundred years is not old enough?" The woman gave him a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can always be very strange. In the dream world, those people are vying to call my younger sister. Of course... the Queen is not "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's still Miss," Sean looked helpless. "If the two think it's better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc...What are they talking about? Joe looked at each other with a blank face, madam? Miss? No matter how you look at this person, it is a man. And what does it mean to have handed over to the devil? The red moon did not appear, what is the devil in their mouth? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This person is the last priest of the church?" The woman, who was called Zoe, looked at him a few times. "The hope of the Queen of the Stars, but in the end, The tool for stupid people to fight for power, although it was an enemy, felt a little worthwhile for her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So let's end it all, it's not a bad idea. Reincarnation." Another person nodded. "Since everyone is here, let's set off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To, arrived? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy couldn’t take care of the inexplicable words in front, and quickly looked around for a circle—the stone boat was not big enough to accommodate an army. No other gray fort vessels can be seen around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult..." Joe gritted his teeth and asked the doubts in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Zoe, “The rescue team you said is here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
