			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting place is still the same as last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much change in the seating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris walked into the restaurant and saw Roland sitting by the French window at a glance. The bustling city of mankind spreads under his feet, just like the continuation of his figure. This visual difference has given her the illusion that the other party is sacred and inviolable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head and left the distracting thought behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat down opposite Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to eat?" Roland saw her shaking her head and waved her hand to the waiter. "If that's the case, then come and make a good one." We ate and talked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coffee and pastries were quickly picked up, and Wakiris did not say no, she naturally provoked a peninsula Put the soft cake into your mouth and carefully taste its softness and sweetness, as if it was not a negotiation with the enemy, but a special tea party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not quite the same as before." Roland stared at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought about it, it’s not a bad habit to eat and talk." Wajiris replied unhurriedly. The first time I met was too passive, and I was almost led by the other side, but this time it wouldn't be - she could imagine the proud face of the other party when she sent the message, but no one could always be proud of it. I have endured for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," Roland pouted. "You replied to me this time because you thought about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiri nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what's the answer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I refuse."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she caught a trace of ignorance and incomprehension on Roland's face - probably he didn't expect that he would reject it so simply, even the seemingly calm feelings appeared small flaws. The atmosphere between the two seemed to solidify, and Roland kept the posture of holding the cup. After a long time, he sent it to his mouth and frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What is the reason?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The choice of zero and half is sounding It does make sense. Compared to the continuation of the ethnic group, a pioneering force can’t be anything. To stop the destruction of the world, it is unavoidable to pay a certain price. To be honest, I am almost convinced by you.” Wakiri Silk added a piece of pastry to his mouth. "Unfortunately, all of this must be established in fact to make sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am talking about the facts. Roland sighed, his tone changed for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I can't prove it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Roland suddenly silenced . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also found out, right? I am trapped in this field, and all the outside information I receive comes from you. Whether it is the Pioneer in the wolf The heart kingdom is retreating, or the so-called sun's glory. I can't even verify it, let alone make decisions based on this information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I thought that you would be smarter. It’s been a long time since I came to the dream world and judged the potential of human warfare based on historical documents. Isn’t this result obvious?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The potential does not mean strength," Wakiris said in a tit-for-tat manner. "Yes, the power that humans are currently showing is indeed very strong, otherwise Erskuk will not regard you as an equal opponent! But the same, ethnic groups Most of the energy has been dragged down by the Tianhai world. If someone realizes that they can't take care of them and must give up one side, human beings may not be able to withstand the full blow of my family!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused, "In the final analysis, the gains you have gained are It is from the rise of civilization. After hundreds of years, it may be the same as the effect brought by the debris, but now the situation tends to be biased, I can't judge it. So in the future, you can send me any news. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris looked out the window and felt the glory of the human city. This time, it was a bad smell to meet, and the calmness revealed by the other party finally disappeared. Instead, it was obviously disappointing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that she didn’t feel the comfort she had expected. The threat of the gods still exists. The warning of the "thousand-shaped" Sistallis has not been lifted. If the other party said that it is true, then the refusal is undoubtedly the hopeless answer in the semi-finished and zero-success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s a sloppy choice to let her do things that are unfavourable to the community, just by the human side. In contrast, she would rather choose the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the decision is a great danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakirith swallowed the last piece of cake, making it easy, "Thank you for your hospitality, I will miss this taste in the future." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to eat, you can do it again next time." Roland shook his head. "You don't have to say this like the last supper."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Wajilis couldn’t help but stunned, and in the one hundred responses she had conceived, she was angry, turned her face, sneered, and screamed, but This is not included - since she has rejected the offer, it is not surprising that Roland is looking for an opportunity to solve her problem. After all, she is always a Maharaja, and the ethnic group is also the biggest enemy of mankind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go back first." Roland long gasped out and stood up and walked outside the restaurant. "I will continue to send the message, even if you want to avoid them, That's also true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy - did you listen to yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris couldn’t help but ask, “What are you going to do next?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What should I do?" He did not return. "My thoughts have never changed, the secrets of the source of magic are uncovered, and the battle of God is completely ended - no matter what choices you make."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a disguise, or is he really thinking? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris couldn’t help but reveal the last question Roland asked when he last met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think that the "Thousand-shaped" Sistalis was wrong a thousand years ago?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think of the martial arts association?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiji Wen Han asked while holding the steering wheel. After the car turned into the ramp, it opened the Green Field Bridge. There are not many vehicles on the bridge, the view is extremely transparent, the sparkling spacious river and the high-rise buildings on the opposite side of the building are spread out along the skyline, as if there is no end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bridge is also the dividing line between the urban area and the suburbs. From the Rheinland Green Sanatorium to the Boozou Building, it is basically through it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm...somewhat different from the imagination." Compared to the scenery in front of him, Jielu seems to be more interested in the interior of the car, she pinches for a while Pinch the soft leather on the door and touch the rising sound of the center console. The ruby-like eyes will turn from the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? What do you think of the association?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To...more It’s mysterious, not like a hotel, it’s on the side of the road.” Jieluo muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Prism City used to be true, but it has been a little trouble lately, so we can only move here for a while." Up, in front of the little girl, she naturally does not have to be indifferent to maintain the distance. "In addition, I am not asking this, but the personal feelings of your visit to the park. After all, if you want to learn the power of nature in the future, you have to stay in a nursing home for a long time. If you have any needs in life, you can talk to the master. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl did not answer immediately, but turned her head and asked, "Is Uncle Roland working here too?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
