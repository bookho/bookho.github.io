			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two left, the ashes following the five kings suddenly stopped Steps, turned and said, "I owe you an apology, sire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time Roland has heard her use honorific words for herself, "Nothing, happening in the palace." I have some of those things..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We all know that it is not you," Ashes shook his head. "Those people can't lead us to defeat the church. It is impossible to give the witch full freedom and trust. I am sorry, until you defeat the church, I believe this.” She paused. “Every witch will remember everything you do, and you are more suitable than him. Be the brother of Tilly's adult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash will say such a thing, can only say that Tilly himself thinks so. The result was not until the end, they did not believe that they are the four princes... Roland was a little bit screaming, but is this an alternative way of recognition? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the smiling sister behind her, he suddenly understood something in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary witch's right hand cares the chest, slightly bent, the black ponytail hangs down the shoulders, the golden eyes are like the dazzling stars in the dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Ashbringer greets you, sigh.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;******** ***********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, Andrea waited for the long-awaited feast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not looking forward to leaving, but looking forward to the new food that is claimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last parting, she has been obsessed with what Her Majesty said is better than ice cream, and this time he has always had a great look forward to. It’s just that it’s a big deal with the church. She didn’t bother to take the initiative, and now she can finally get what she wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquet was not held in the castle, but was arranged in the expanded back garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the promenade made of olive trees, when you walk into the center of the garden, you have not seen the food, and a very rich fragrance has already entered the Ande. Leah's nose. Crystal fish of the Yongdong Glacier? What is the smell of eggs in the heart of the wolf? Or is it a fjord rainbow trout known for its delicious flavor? No... not right, she has never smelled such a tempting taste, even the most rare ingredients, can not do such aroma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suddenly feel so hungry." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you living this life in the West?" Morrier licked his lips. "It's too enviable!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t enjoyed it a few times," and the wind and the lotus and Evelyn, "They are the objects you should envy."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kind of banquet is not available every day," Candlelight explained. "The usual desserts are only made in three days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Only three days..." Molier helped the forehead. "Why do I think you are showing off?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I don't have it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, don't let the saliva flow out," Ashed a glimpse of Andrea, even though her throat was still swaying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia did not sneer back as usual, and her attention at this moment was completely concentrated on several circular stumps placed on one side of the garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They look like they grow out of the ground, the thick trunk needs seven or eight people to embrace, the middle is rolling and hot, it seems that there is something Burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she walked in, she discovered that the inside of the stump had been hollowed out, and a huge iron pot stood on the top, and the fragrance was distributed in the soup in the pot. from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low table next to the stump is filled with a variety of foods - although there are many different types, they are all things that you can usually eat. There are no rare dishes. Another convenience that makes her unpredictable is that these foods are all raw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
