			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the development of new artillery, he envisioned many options. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as the best weapon, only the most suitable weapon, comprehensive combat opponents, battlefield environment, production level and other considerations. In the end, he chose to be able to A near-low-cost mortar can replace the outdated front field gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its range can effectively cover the area of ​​two hundred meters to three kilometers, filling the gap between the heavy machine gun and the fortress gun, while enhancing the close range The effect of the blow inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the existence of the desperate defense line, the most important role of the mortar is to make up the leak, which can be carried by the soldiers, over the mountains, and established in any place in the mountains. The bombardment of the position is light and easy to carry, which is difficult for other weapons to match. In addition, the height difference between the mountains is very common, and the curved firepower can exert the greatest power in this terrain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no wintertown production level is the reason for Roland to finally make this decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure of the mortar is much simpler than the howitzer. The shell of the shell can be made of cast iron, the barrel has no twisting line, and the production requirements are lower and will not affect. Capacity to 152mm artillery. If a small-caliber field gun is developed, whether it is a retractor, a barrel with a rifling, or a corresponding trigger fuze, it is in conflict with the fort gun that is currently trying to produce independently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new machine tool and processing technology not fully tested, even if the attempt fails, there is Anna as a means of emergency, using black fire to make up the key to the fortress Parts, the impact will not be too big. But with the addition of new field guns, the production pressure will inevitably increase exponentially, and the First Army may fall into the dilemma of no guns available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Roland has also considered the development of grenades for individual soldiers as a supplementary weapon, and even made several samples for testing, but filled with black powder. The performance of the test article is really unbearable, and may be of some use in the urban battle to recover the gray castle, but its power is not enough to face the evil beast and the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that the chemical production capacity of No Winter City is not extravagant enough to distribute the grenade loaded with double-base gunpowder to each soldier, he has to give up this plan. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the night, Roland walked down the second floor and gently rang the Anna bedroom The door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, Anna peeped out from behind the door and saw him, his expression was quite unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this surprise only lasted for less than a second, and soon her face appeared on her bright face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I walked into the room, Roland picked her up from behind and walked to the bed with her bare feet, and fell down on her soft bed with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you today..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna’s blue eyes sparkle like night The jewel in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, she will take Roland two or three times a week. According to her, such a frequency will not affect daily work. Of course, if Roland asks, she will not refuse. It’s just that since he confessed his feelings for the nightingale, he always felt very guilty. He hadn’t asked Anna for anything for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and personally came to Anna’s room for the first time—although she was the only one of all witches to live alone, but after all, she fell asleep with leaves and scrolls next door, worries When it comes to sound insulation, the two will always exchange feelings in the upstairs. Like this situation, it is not surprising that Anna will be surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to talk to you about the world of dreams," Roland whispered in her ear. "There is no time to elaborate in the afternoon. You also want to know." More...about the life I have experienced in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you dream of is another world?" Anna quickly guessed the corner of the truth. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, like a world built on my memory, but it has many special places, such as nature that is very similar to magic. Force..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
