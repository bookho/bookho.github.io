			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get up," Tilly said flatly. "I know that you must be full of doubts at this moment. Why do the military routinely recruit informal residents? Why filter conditions? It’s so weird, and... why is it that I’m going to do this explanation, etc. In fact, these questions are complicated to say, but I’ll find it very simple after I’ve experienced it myself, so I’m not going to elaborate here, just mentioning a few points. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, you are not joining the First Army or the Second Army, but an army that your brother intends to form." In the past, any army was different, so the screening would be more special."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This caused a small commotion, no doubt the new team The path of ascent is wider and less likely to be marginalized. For those of them who have no roots, it is obviously the best choice to go to a brand new military development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fool who can understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But your current status can only be considered a reserve." The princess continued, "Because it is so different, I don't have any objects to refer to. This means that everything has to start from scratch, and the difficulties encountered will inevitably exceed imagination. If you have to compare it, your previous assessment difficulty is not worth mentioning. Now there are 16 people standing here, but they can really As an empty knight, I am afraid there are only one or two, or ... none of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gude couldn't help but take a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not surprised by how hard it was, but the first half of the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t know the difference between the "empty knight" and the traditional knight, it is an incredible thing to let the ordinary people who are born in poverty get this opportunity. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is very difficult? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is not a matter of course! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt a heart suddenly hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what shocked him is still behind--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to truly understanding the new army Why the object, in this city... No, it should be said that in this world, only me and my brother, plus Roland can not be too distracted, so I will be responsible for teaching you later."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is like a general, so that Goode is in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Royal Highness personally teach them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, do they have the chance to become the knight of the Grey House Princess? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if there is no land, it is no longer a nobleman. This is still a great honor, especially for new migrants like him who have nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are also not sure where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are not afraid of imperial rudeness and let the princess get bored, everyone is afraid to cheer out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid breathing around you is the best proof of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All qualified training will be concentrated in the new shoal area, you will get a new residence and official identity, and become a part of the new king." Tilly reached down and pressed down. "But remember that even if it is a reserve person, it belongs to the military. Your actions will be restricted. If you withdraw halfway, you will be regarded as a defect. Any violation of the military order will result in severe punishment. Understood!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes... Your Highness!" Despite being shocked by the princess’s serious warning, the voice of the answer is not bright, but no A person shows remorse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, and finally an oath to the king of the Grey Fort," Tilly looked at the tall man at the table, "Wied."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the oath is very simple and easy to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even too straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, "I have no disdain for Roland, and there is no hostility to the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Who dares to have it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Associated with the Princess of the Royal Princess is also a witch, Gourde said that when he said here, he did not consciously mention the volume to the maximum, as if he was lower, he could not show his loyalty. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the oath, the guards came forward and distributed the parcels to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From this moment on, you are a member of the army." Tilly smiled. "The first round of recruitment is expected to last for a week or so, and then training will be Formally started, and the things in the package are the first things you need to learn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When Goode returned to the Central Square, the sky was already dim, and the people who came to recruit had already been scattered seven or eight, and the uncle and the mountain fruit disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a surprise. No one has thought that the assessment will take so long. They still have family members to take care of. It is impossible to stay in the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he couldn’t care too much, and wrapped the parcel tightly into his arms, and flew like a temporary living area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joy reverberates in his heart, and it seems that there is a power that can't be finished. Even if the cold wind blows, he can't feel a cold. The snow under the feet is squeaking, and the road that is stepped on by thousands of people is like a dark brown road mark - maybe it will be re-covered by snow tomorrow, but now it guides him in the direction of returning home. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of the low and warm earthen houses, Rachel is cooking porridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry... I am late, today-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," The girl broke the road, "The next door uncle told me that you found a good job, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for him to answer, the other party He has extended his right hand to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the delicious thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...啥?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you said you want to bring the egg pancakes to me!" Rachel rose up dissatisfiedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, actually throwing this whole thing behind, Goode quickly made up for it, "Next time, next time you can eat one every week! No, Eat two!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two?" Rachel doubted, "Really?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Of course, this job is not ordinary, I have also seen the Princess of the Princess!" Goode took off the wet shoes, rolled up the half of the trousers, and went to the edge of the fire, then carefully removed the package from his arms, "Look This is what she gave me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is inside?" The curiosity of the girl overwhelmed her dissatisfaction with the loss of appointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, open it," Goode unveiled the tie, couldn't help but sigh, "This is..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Book?" Rachel answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took all the things out and found that it was a book. The cover is printed with different pictures and looks very beautiful, but unfortunately he can't understand a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can... help me see what it is?" At this time, he can only turn to Rachel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl smiled smugly. "I can't guarantee to recognize it all. Hey, this book is a reading and writing... skill, that is commonly used... Vocabulary... shorthand, the third is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
