			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What if I get bitten by a wicked beast?" Roland asked, "will it be like them?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that it is not a Resident Evil of the Alien Edition. He thinks that there is no way to extract viral antigens at the current level of technology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not," said the iron axe, "How can you ask this kind of question"? "If you get bitten, it will only become one." The body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then their meat, can you eat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter exclaimed One voice: "His Royal Highness! How can this evil thing be eaten, they are all polluted by hell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looks to the iron axe, the latter Nodded, "Your knight is right. I have cut the meat of the evil beast and fed the hound. As a result, the hound will die soon after eating the meat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Is it? It's a pity," Roland sighed. The source of food in this era is very scarce. If the evil beast can eat, winter is a bumper harvest. Think about it, the animals in the entire forest are going crazy and running to the border town, even the hunting tools are saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he visited the wall, he decided to visit Nana Va. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, the nearest aristocratic residence from the city wall has been used by Roland as a battlefield hospital. Of course, the claim is public. Just in case, this is the most guarded place in the town except the city wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the house here took away all the property that he could take away when he returned to the long song fortress, and the town of Bianbu itself is a place that can be abandoned at any time. Therefore, although this house is large, there are no decorations such as murals, carpets, and porcelain. If it is not clean, it is like a homeless place that has been vacant for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pierced the first floor of the wooden partition wall, except for the walkway and the foyer, so that all the other rooms were joined together and ten beds were placed. A simple hospital is a model. There are no nurses, no doctors, and even these ten beds are unlikely to be fully used. Nana's treatment does not require bed rest, but it immediately works. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was on the second floor of the hospital during the day, and Anna would come over to accompany her when she was fine. Tiguin Pine and Brian are responsible for the first floor, and there are two guards guarding the door. It is foolproof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what Roland did not expect was that the first wounded received by the Battlefield Hospital was not from the militia who defended the walls, but the workers at the North Slope Mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The nail felt that his hands were shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the screams that the iron head has become hoarse, he speeds up again and even wants to fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this is because of his own negligence, he thought, really damn, how to forget the embarrassment of the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew that I shouldn’t take over the big guys! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the black-painted big guy was installed at the entrance of the mine, the work of the miners was much easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most tiring job was to transport the excavated ore out of the mine. When the mine basket is filled with stones, it takes three to four people to drag. Usually two people push behind and the rest are pulled in front. The uneven and uneven tunnel ground has been mined for many years and has been ground evenly by the mine basket. The iron pad at the bottom of the mine basket also needs to be replaced frequently. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A week ago, the chief knight, the conductor, and his men carried a large number of strange metal parts to the mountains and tossed them into a stove for a few days. Unexpectedly, the nail can actually move itself after the fire, not only can move, but also endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers said that this is the invention of His Royal Highness, it seems to be called a steam engine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the hemp rope is tightened to the mine basket and the fire is ignited, this big guy will scream, turn the winch, and smash the mine basket quickly. Mine hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
